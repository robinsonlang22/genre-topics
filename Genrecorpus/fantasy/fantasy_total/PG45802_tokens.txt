chapter
i
phœbe
sends
a
birthday
this
story
really
begins
with
the
arrival
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
addressed
to
molly
but
while
the
postman
is
bringing
it
along
the
road
there
may
be
just
time
to
explain
about
jack
and
molly
s
birthday
so
that
you
will
understand
why
molly
sat
down
to
supper
wishing
earnestly
that
silver
bangles
were
considered
useful
and
necessary
presents
jack
and
molly
were
twins
and
this
was
their
ninth
birthday
such
a
happy
exciting
day
it
had
been
it
like
a
birthday
all
day
long
so
you
can
guess
how
jolly
it
was
and
how
special
it
made
jack
and
molly
feel
little
did
they
guess
what
a
weird
and
mysterious
end
to
the
day
was
now
approaching
they
had
received
a
number
of
beautiful
presents
and
to
their
unbounded
joy
a
fine
new
bicycle
each
from
mother
and
father
but
there
was
one
particular
thing
that
molly
had
wanted
for
her
birthday
and
that
was
a
silver
bangle
like
mother
s
she
had
told
jack
only
silver
one
that
nearly
slips
off
when
i
hang
my
hand
down
and
that
i
have
to
push
back
up
my
it
as
there
happened
also
to
be
one
other
thing
that
jack
wanted
specially
a
box
of
paints
the
two
children
had
decided
some
days
ago
to
write
to
their
aunt
phœbe
who
always
remembered
their
birthday
and
hint
to
her
as
delicately
as
possible
what
the
most
acceptable
presents
would
be
it
had
been
a
forlorn
hope
for
molly
because
aunt
phœbe
had
fixed
ideas
about
useless
and
useful
presents
probably
she
might
consider
a
box
of
paints
useful
to
encourage
jack
s
artistic
leanings
but
a
still
molly
sent
her
letter
and
hoped
for
the
best
on
looking
at
jack
and
molly
you
would
have
noticed
at
once
that
they
both
had
the
same
kind
of
brown
curly
hair
and
the
same
frank
expression
about
the
eyes
but
while
molly
s
eyes
were
brown
and
her
face
often
wistful
and
dreamy
jack
s
eyes
were
blue
and
his
expression
alert
and
full
of
energy
there
was
a
certain
reckless
air
about
jack
but
the
postman
has
reached
their
house
and
is
handing
in
two
brown
paper
parcels
and
so
the
story
really
begins
it
s
aunt
phœbe
s
handwriting
jack
exclaimed
as
he
seized
his
parcel
yours
looks
a
jack
said
molly
breathlessly
tugging
at
the
string
of
her
parcel
yours
looks
like
something
in
a
box
too
probably
it
will
be
a
bracelet
jack
said
encouragingly
hoping
that
it
would
be
for
he
felt
he
should
be
almost
as
disappointed
as
molly
if
it
wasn
t
jack
was
the
first
to
vanquish
strings
and
paper
and
with
a
yell
of
delight
he
tore
the
wrapper
off
his
parcel
and
disclosed
a
beautiful
shiny
black
for
a
few
moments
mother
and
father
and
jack
were
so
engrossed
in
examining
and
admiring
the
box
that
they
did
not
notice
that
molly
had
unwrapped
her
parcel
until
her
intense
quietness
was
borne
in
upon
them
and
they
all
three
turned
round
molly
stood
by
the
side
of
the
table
gazing
tearfully
at
a
round
thing
half
buried
in
a
mass
of
tissue
paper
what
is
it
dear
asked
mother
crossing
over
to
her
side
it
s
began
molly
then
stopped
because
of
an
uncomfortable
lump
in
her
throat
let
me
see
said
mother
and
she
picked
up
the
grey
thing
and
turned
it
over
in
her
hands
on
the
other
side
was
pinned
a
slip
of
paper
on
which
was
written
for
molly
she
will
be
a
good
girl
on
her
birthday
and
have
many
happy
returns
i
thought
this
useful
little
thing
would
do
for
her
love
aunt
phœbe
why
it
s
a
pincushion
said
mother
what
a
beastly
shame
said
jack
be
quiet
jack
it
s
a
very
pretty
one
mother
added
consolingly
funny
shape
isn
t
it
queried
father
it
me
it
s
the
shape
of
do
you
call
those
things
it
s
shaped
like
a
pumpkin
answered
mother
but
it
s
grey
objected
father
why
didn
t
they
make
it
yellow
or
green
while
they
were
about
it
i
suppose
aunt
phœbe
thought
grey
would
keep
clean
longer
said
jack
that
s
why
she
chose
had
aunt
phœbe
known
when
she
bought
this
useful
little
thing
what
it
really
she
have
foreseen
any
of
the
mysterious
happenings
that
were
to
follow
the
arrival
of
her
birthday
would
have
preferred
to
send
her
niece
half
a
dozen
of
the
most
jingly
silver
bangles
ever
made
for
she
disapproved
of
adventures
in
any
shape
or
form
even
more
than
she
disapproved
of
bangles
yet
it
was
entirely
through
aunt
phœbe
that
jack
and
molly
took
part
in
the
adventure
of
the
grey
pumpkin
at
all
chapter
ii
adventure
when
molly
went
up
to
bed
that
night
she
took
the
pincushion
with
her
and
placed
it
on
the
and
tried
her
best
to
think
that
it
looked
nice
it
really
will
be
useful
she
told
herself
and
to
prove
this
she
picked
up
a
long
pin
and
stuck
it
into
the
pumpkin
pincushion
though
with
a
little
more
violence
than
was
necessary
then
she
ran
across
the
room
and
tumbled
into
bed
it
was
a
beautiful
moonlight
night
and
the
moonbeams
streaming
into
the
room
made
it
almost
as
light
as
day
molly
lay
there
snug
drowsily
planning
out
lovely
rides
that
she
and
jack
would
go
as
soon
as
they
had
both
learnt
how
to
manage
their
cycles
the
thought
of
her
bicycle
sent
a
warm
thrill
through
her
heart
and
a
smile
of
content
hovering
about
her
mouth
she
could
hear
jack
in
the
next
room
moving
noisily
about
he
always
made
a
dreadful
noise
in
his
room
thumping
and
banging
things
down
and
whistling
shrilly
until
he
got
into
bed
and
the
extra
excitement
of
having
a
birthday
seemed
to
make
the
thumping
extra
heavy
and
the
whistling
extra
shrill
presently
the
thuds
and
bumps
and
whistles
ceased
abruptly
and
she
knew
that
jack
was
in
bed
and
to
be
in
bed
and
to
be
asleep
were
practically
the
same
thing
with
jack
no
sooner
did
his
head
touch
the
pillow
than
he
was
as
good
as
asleep
and
no
sooner
did
he
open
his
eyes
in
the
morning
than
he
was
out
of
bed
and
hunting
for
his
stockings
sleep
did
not
come
so
readily
to
molly
she
would
often
lie
awake
for
a
long
time
after
she
had
gone
to
bed
thinking
and
planning
her
brain
ticking
busily
molly
was
just
wondering
whether
it
would
be
possible
for
her
and
jack
to
cycle
to
brighton
and
back
in
a
day
and
whether
mother
would
let
them
go
when
all
at
once
she
became
aware
that
something
was
moving
in
her
room
a
soft
rolling
sound
came
from
the
direction
of
the
window
molly
raised
her
head
and
gazed
with
startled
eyes
across
the
moonlit
room
she
could
see
something
large
and
round
moving
softly
on
the
it
looked
just
as
surely
her
eyes
were
playing
her
some
trick
she
stared
across
at
the
frightened
yet
fascinated
then
she
sat
up
no
her
eyes
had
not
deceived
her
there
in
front
of
the
rocking
gently
from
side
to
side
was
the
pumpkin
pincushion
grown
to
nearly
three
times
its
original
size
and
growing
still
larger
every
second
bigger
and
bigger
it
grew
until
it
had
grown
almost
as
big
round
as
the
front
wheel
of
molly
s
bicycle
then
it
ceased
rocking
and
growing
and
remained
still
for
a
few
seconds
then
rolling
quietly
along
the
and
over
the
edge
it
fell
with
a
dull
thud
to
the
floor
across
to
the
door
it
rolled
bumped
softly
against
it
and
drew
back
a
few
paces
molly
watched
as
the
door
swung
open
and
the
grey
pumpkin
passed
out
on
to
the
landing
molly
was
filled
with
amazement
what
had
happened
what
did
it
mean
she
remained
quite
still
hesitating
for
a
moment
then
she
sprang
out
of
bed
her
first
fear
had
vanished
leaving
in
its
place
an
overwhelming
another
feeling
that
she
couldn
t
just
felt
that
she
follow
the
pumpkin
her
mind
once
made
up
she
felt
perfectly
calm
and
collected
even
collected
enough
to
slip
hastily
into
some
clothes
and
put
on
her
little
frock
and
her
outdoor
shoes
never
before
in
all
her
short
life
had
molly
dressed
so
quickly
meanwhile
the
grey
pumpkin
was
making
its
way
along
the
moonlit
landing
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
heard
it
begin
to
she
whisked
into
jack
s
room
jack
jack
she
called
in
a
loud
whisper
don
t
be
frightened
it
s
only
hush
are
you
awake
oh
jack
hush
as
jack
uttered
a
sound
between
a
loud
yawn
and
a
groan
get
up
quickly
it
s
all
right
only
do
be
quick
quick
jack
sat
up
with
a
jerk
what
is
it
what
s
the
matter
he
exclaimed
hush
don
t
make
a
sound
or
you
ll
spoil
everything
p
raps
put
on
some
clothes
quickly
and
come
with
me
oh
don
t
ask
questions
jack
but
do
be
quick
and
don
t
make
the
slightest
and
molly
ran
back
to
the
landing
and
listened
thud
thud
thud
the
pumpkin
was
rolling
steadily
and
slowly
from
stair
to
stair
and
judging
by
the
sound
was
already
a
long
way
down
hurry
jack
said
molly
it
was
easy
for
jack
to
be
quick
though
not
so
easy
to
refrain
from
asking
questions
but
to
tell
him
not
to
make
the
slightest
noise
was
expecting
a
little
too
much
of
him
however
he
only
bumped
twice
against
the
and
knocked
his
off
the
and
fell
over
a
chair
before
he
was
ready
and
all
things
considered
he
behaved
in
a
very
creditable
manner
afterward
when
thinking
things
over
molly
was
surprised
at
her
own
calmness
in
remembering
to
tell
him
about
clothes
and
being
quiet
but
remember
she
did
and
found
herself
explaining
to
her
brother
as
rapidly
as
possible
just
what
had
happened
i
know
it
sounds
impossible
jack
she
said
but
it
s
true
and
you
ll
see
it
yourself
in
a
the
two
children
sped
quickly
along
the
landing
and
down
the
first
flight
of
stairs
passing
from
dark
shadows
into
moonlit
patches
as
they
went
by
landing
windows
then
back
into
the
shadows
again
and
down
another
flight
and
out
into
the
moonlight
once
more
so
on
and
on
guided
by
the
dull
thud
thud
of
the
pumpkin
on
the
soft
below
them
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
last
flight
the
sound
ceased
it
s
reached
the
bottom
whispered
molly
jack
shook
his
head
incredulously
he
had
not
seen
the
pumpkin
yet
and
could
not
believe
it
was
the
sole
cause
of
the
bumping
noise
he
had
heard
on
the
stairs
when
the
noise
ceased
they
hesitated
about
continuing
their
descent
it
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
last
flight
and
molly
thought
it
would
be
so
horrible
if
one
of
them
put
their
foot
on
that
rolling
grey
thing
in
the
dark
as
they
waited
they
heard
a
slight
a
streak
of
light
appeared
and
they
saw
the
back
door
swing
quietly
open
the
jack
could
see
plainly
that
it
was
a
huge
ponderously
out
and
the
door
began
slowly
to
close
again
quick
gasped
molly
and
the
two
sped
down
the
last
flight
and
the
next
moment
were
standing
breathless
outside
the
back
door
their
garden
was
long
and
backed
on
to
a
small
wood
which
had
been
the
scene
of
many
a
picnic
during
the
summer
months
a
low
broken
fence
divided
the
wood
from
the
garden
and
it
was
for
this
fence
that
the
pumpkin
was
heading
it
rolled
steadily
on
in
a
quiet
deliberate
way
that
made
it
the
more
uncanny
jack
and
molly
quaint
little
figures
moving
warily
over
the
grass
with
glistening
eyes
and
rapidly
beating
hearts
half
fearful
half
curious
and
very
excited
jack
could
scarcely
believe
his
eyes
even
now
and
stared
fascinated
at
the
moving
grey
thing
in
front
of
him
as
it
glided
under
the
broken
fence
and
into
the
wood
beyond
as
it
gained
the
woodland
path
the
sound
of
little
twigs
and
dried
leaves
crackling
as
it
rolled
over
them
came
to
the
children
s
ears
jack
and
molly
clambered
over
the
fence
and
in
doing
so
jack
lost
one
of
his
slippers
but
did
not
miss
it
in
his
excitement
and
they
both
ran
a
few
steps
along
the
path
to
get
in
sight
of
the
pumpkin
again
illustration
jack
and
molly
clambered
over
the
fence
it
was
not
so
easy
to
see
in
the
wood
for
the
trees
met
overhead
and
screened
out
the
moonlight
here
and
there
a
stray
beam
penetrated
scattering
little
pools
of
silver
light
on
the
ground
and
each
time
the
pumpkin
passed
into
these
pools
of
light
the
children
hastened
their
footsteps
but
faltered
again
each
time
it
glided
into
the
gloom
where
it
was
difficult
to
see
and
there
was
nothing
save
the
crackling
of
the
twigs
to
guide
them
suddenly
molly
caught
hold
of
her
brother
s
arm
and
they
both
stood
still
the
pumpkin
had
stopped
in
the
dim
light
at
the
foot
of
a
gigantic
old
tree
with
a
gnarled
and
twisted
trunk
watching
breathlessly
they
saw
it
knock
three
times
deliberately
and
heavily
against
the
bark
and
then
roll
back
a
few
paces
and
wait
there
was
a
low
creaking
sound
and
the
side
of
the
tree
swung
outward
like
a
door
and
the
pumpkin
passed
in
the
door
began
slowly
to
close
again
jack
and
molly
looked
at
each
other
what
should
they
do
they
both
felt
it
was
now
or
never
now
said
jack
quick
assented
molly
like
a
flash
they
reached
the
door
and
slipped
in
time
it
closed
behind
them
with
a
muffled
thud
catching
the
sleeve
of
jack
s
coat
as
it
did
so
and
they
found
themselves
in
complete
darkness
their
curiosity
and
excitement
turned
to
sudden
fear
when
they
heard
the
door
close
behind
them
and
they
stood
quite
still
with
their
backs
pressed
hard
against
the
interior
of
the
not
daring
to
move
a
soft
familiar
rolling
sound
could
be
heard
a
short
way
in
front
of
them
it
ceased
there
was
a
short
silence
then
came
three
distinct
knocks
followed
by
a
creaking
noise
and
another
door
opened
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
as
the
light
crept
into
the
interior
of
the
tree
the
children
saw
to
their
astonishment
that
it
was
not
moonlight
but
daylight
the
subdued
light
of
evening
a
quick
glance
showed
them
the
hollow
interior
of
the
huge
tree
and
the
distance
they
were
from
the
open
door
as
they
caught
sight
of
the
ground
they
both
gave
a
start
for
it
was
composed
solely
of
half
a
dozen
branches
stretched
across
from
side
to
side
and
beneath
the
branches
was
a
big
black
hole
that
went
down
and
down
and
looked
as
if
it
had
no
bottom
they
realized
that
they
were
standing
at
the
extreme
edge
of
the
hole
on
a
little
step
of
thick
sticky
clay
however
were
they
to
walk
over
on
one
of
those
thin
branches
to
the
door
on
the
other
side
without
missing
their
footing
and
falling
down
into
the
hole
but
even
as
they
caught
hold
of
hands
determined
to
make
a
desperate
effort
to
cross
while
there
was
light
to
see
the
grey
pumpkin
passed
out
into
the
daylight
and
the
door
swung
slowly
to
again
and
they
were
left
in
darkness
once
more
they
stood
stock
still
not
daring
to
move
oh
jack
whatever
shall
we
do
said
molly
almost
crying
knock
on
the
door
behind
us
and
go
back
home
suggested
jack
let
s
get
out
of
this
old
dark
hole
and
the
pumpkin
can
go
where
it
jolly
well
likes
leave
go
my
arm
a
moment
molly
and
i
ll
turn
round
and
he
turned
to
suit
the
action
to
his
words
tearing
the
corner
of
his
sleeve
out
of
the
crack
as
he
did
so
but
jack
molly
said
hurriedly
wait
a
minute
somehow
i
ve
got
a
feeling
that
we
to
go
on
if
only
we
could
don
t
knock
yet
jack
i
feel
as
if
somebody
wants
us
through
that
door
on
the
other
side
if
only
we
could
get
across
oh
jack
do
be
ll
slip
look
here
said
jack
are
you
afraid
to
chance
the
you
really
think
it
s
worth
it
the
pumpkin
must
have
rolled
across
without
the
floor
giving
then
mean
what
shall
we
do
jack
shall
we
try
suggested
jack
molly
hesitated
then
yes
let
s
she
said
we
she
faltered
you
stay
here
while
i
go
across
and
knock
three
times
on
the
other
door
said
jack
at
once
decided
then
while
it
s
light
you
run
oh
jack
do
be
careful
cried
molly
for
jack
had
already
started
he
felt
with
his
foot
for
the
thickest
branch
and
stepped
recklessly
forward
to
his
delight
he
found
that
it
was
quite
easy
to
walk
across
and
all
their
fears
had
been
groundless
why
moll
he
called
joyfully
it
s
as
easy
as
anything
wait
a
sec
i
m
almost
he
reached
the
clay
step
on
the
other
side
and
gave
three
good
knocks
to
relieve
his
feelings
with
a
low
creaking
the
door
opened
slowly
and
as
the
light
streamed
in
molly
ran
quickly
and
easily
across
and
the
next
moment
they
both
stood
outside
the
tree
and
the
door
was
shut
chapter
iii
other
side
of
the
the
two
children
gazed
in
astonishment
at
the
unfamiliar
scene
in
front
of
them
for
here
was
a
place
they
had
never
seen
before
and
yet
apparently
a
place
within
ten
minutes
walk
of
their
place
that
led
out
of
the
little
wood
at
the
end
of
their
garden
and
they
thought
they
knew
every
nook
and
corner
of
that
wood
and
of
the
fields
and
lanes
beyond
for
several
miles
round
their
house
yet
here
was
a
place
they
had
never
seen
before
and
more
puzzling
still
the
soft
glow
of
evening
and
sunset
had
taken
the
place
of
the
moonlight
and
gloom
which
had
been
all
around
them
in
the
wood
for
they
were
still
standing
close
to
the
same
big
old
tree
but
instead
of
the
wood
continuing
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
on
and
ending
at
the
edge
of
farmer
hart
s
cornfields
as
it
always
done
it
ended
abruptly
right
in
front
of
them
by
the
side
of
a
broad
white
road
this
road
stretched
away
to
the
left
up
and
up
a
big
hill
you
could
see
it
winding
like
a
white
ribbon
bordered
by
the
green
and
brown
trees
of
the
woods
that
clustered
on
each
side
and
at
the
top
of
the
hill
where
the
road
ended
glistened
the
white
walls
and
roofs
of
a
distant
city
to
the
right
the
road
continued
past
the
wood
where
the
children
were
standing
and
sloped
down
down
till
it
was
lost
to
sight
in
the
burning
crimson
and
gold
afterglow
of
the
sunset
jack
and
molly
looked
up
the
road
and
down
the
road
but
all
was
silent
and
not
a
soul
in
sight
then
a
wisp
of
blue
smoke
among
the
trees
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
caught
their
attention
and
they
saw
that
it
was
curling
from
the
chimney
of
a
snug
little
cottage
which
nestled
half
hidden
on
the
fringe
of
the
wood
across
the
road
the
children
looked
at
each
other
in
bewilderment
then
they
turned
and
examined
the
giant
tree
behind
them
but
that
did
not
help
them
much
it
was
certainly
the
same
tree
but
it
was
not
the
same
wood
something
queer
had
did
not
seem
to
be
even
the
same
country
they
looked
up
and
down
the
road
again
and
behind
them
and
before
listened
but
all
was
silent
their
eyes
wandered
back
to
the
curling
blue
smoke
the
only
sign
of
life
within
sight
better
ask
some
one
where
we
ve
got
to
said
jack
eyeing
the
smoke
but
where
s
it
gone
began
molly
then
broke
off
quickly
hush
what
s
that
she
said
she
plucked
jack
s
sleeve
and
drew
him
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
a
distant
sound
of
voices
came
floating
through
the
still
evening
air
there
were
evidently
two
speakers
for
as
the
sounds
drew
nearer
the
children
could
hear
a
high
loud
jolly
voice
flowing
continuously
and
punctuated
every
now
and
then
by
a
low
mumbling
voice
after
a
few
seconds
the
words
of
the
speaker
became
distinguishable
stuff
and
nonsense
it
cried
shrilly
pull
yourself
together
father
come
now
come
now
snap
your
fingers
in
its
face
laugh
at
it
i
say
the
speaker
made
a
little
hissing
noise
where
is
it
the
other
voice
here
murmured
some
reply
too
low
for
the
children
to
catch
what
s
that
replied
the
first
speaker
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
will
happen
you
ll
be
having
an
attack
of
oh
not
that
not
that
the
low
voice
was
raised
and
pleading
don
t
talk
of
melons
glan
don
t
i
pray
you
they
make
me
think
of
those
now
don
t
you
think
of
that
any
more
ordered
the
high
voice
come
come
come
pull
yourself
together
the
speakers
became
visible
wending
their
way
through
the
wood
in
which
the
children
were
standing
one
was
a
young
fat
man
with
a
jolly
smile
wearing
a
white
overall
and
white
baker
s
cap
he
was
and
was
the
possessor
of
the
high
voice
his
companion
was
a
striking
contrast
to
him
being
old
and
thin
and
pale
with
a
long
white
beard
he
was
dressed
in
a
rich
robe
and
had
a
number
of
keys
dangling
from
his
belt
they
pulled
up
short
when
they
caught
sight
of
jack
and
molly
then
advanced
slowly
with
sidelong
glances
at
each
other
and
low
whispers
molly
stepped
forward
if
you
please
she
said
very
politely
could
you
tell
us
where
we
are
could
you
tell
us
you
are
little
lady
s
more
to
the
point
said
the
young
man
pleasantly
i
m
molly
and
this
is
my
brother
jack
the
little
girl
replied
which
did
not
enlighten
the
young
man
very
much
the
old
man
gazed
at
them
with
his
small
dull
eyes
and
ran
his
fingers
nervously
through
his
beard
we
ve
only
just
that
tree
volunteered
jack
pointing
to
the
giant
tree
behind
them
through
the
tree
exclaimed
the
old
man
and
the
young
man
together
then
you
are
from
the
impossible
world
added
the
young
man
in
an
excited
high
voice
we
live
in
england
said
jack
with
dignity
that
may
be
i
don
t
know
england
but
if
it
lies
on
the
other
side
of
that
tree
it
is
in
the
impossible
why
do
you
call
it
that
asked
molly
because
that
s
its
name
in
our
geography
books
this
is
the
possible
world
and
always
the
young
man
glanced
at
the
old
man
who
turned
his
head
aside
don
t
speak
of
that
groaned
the
old
man
cheer
up
father
cried
the
young
man
pull
yourself
together
now
snap
your
fingers
is
gone
and
he
beamed
encouragingly
down
at
the
thin
little
old
man
beside
him
who
only
looked
more
depressed
than
ever
at
his
son
s
efforts
to
cheer
him
up
but
how
is
it
we
ve
played
in
this
mean
that
so
many
times
and
never
found
our
way
here
before
inquired
jack
because
though
you
ve
walked
that
tree
many
times
you
ve
never
come
it
before
said
the
young
man
there
are
two
sides
to
every
tree
just
as
there
are
two
sides
to
every
question
when
you
walk
round
a
question
do
you
see
both
its
sides
no
it
is
only
if
you
go
a
question
that
you
see
this
side
and
that
well
you
only
walked
round
that
tree
it
stands
to
sense
that
you
couldn
t
find
yourself
here
but
when
you
go
into
the
threw
out
his
behold
here
you
are
it
s
perfectly
it
certainly
sounded
sensible
and
quite
simple
as
the
young
man
explained
it
but
jack
and
molly
still
felt
rather
mystified
but
do
you
call
ours
the
impossible
world
asked
jack
because
it
s
full
of
impossible
things
replied
the
young
man
impossible
people
impossible
ideas
impossible
laws
impossible
houses
there
is
so
much
impossible
misery
and
injustice
and
impossible
talk
that
it
s
quite
impossible
for
any
possible
creature
to
live
in
it
on
the
other
hand
this
land
which
is
the
other
side
of
yours
is
the
possible
world
now
for
a
time
it
was
impossible
but
we
here
the
old
man
winced
i
m
sorry
father
but
you
must
let
me
tell
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
where
they
are
i
know
you
go
and
sit
down
under
that
tree
and
think
of
but
they
re
the
colour
of
lemons
whined
the
old
man
feebly
not
all
of
of
the
ones
that
aren
t
there
run
along
i
shan
t
be
two
minutes
and
he
patted
his
father
on
the
shoulder
as
the
old
man
shuffled
across
the
leaves
to
the
foot
of
a
tree
some
yards
away
where
he
sat
down
and
remained
shaking
his
head
and
looking
on
the
ground
mumbling
to
himself
while
the
young
man
explained
the
cause
of
his
depression
to
jack
and
molly
it
s
this
way
he
began
after
glancing
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
his
father
couldn
t
hear
for
hundreds
of
years
this
has
been
the
possible
world
because
it
was
possible
for
everyone
in
it
to
be
happy
but
there
came
a
time
when
an
evil
influence
crept
into
the
land
and
made
it
impossible
it
was
through
this
evil
thing
that
my
father
who
was
one
of
the
king
s
advisers
lost
his
place
at
court
the
whole
country
was
under
a
cloud
then
old
lives
in
the
cottage
yonder
pointed
to
the
little
cottage
with
the
smoke
curling
from
the
chimney
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
old
nancy
she
discovered
a
spell
and
she
saved
banished
the
evil
thing
to
the
impossible
world
and
our
world
became
possible
again
lately
my
father
has
been
afflicted
with
dreams
that
he
says
always
come
to
him
before
trouble
overtakes
the
country
and
he
fears
by
some
mishap
that
the
country
may
become
impossible
what
does
he
dream
of
inquired
molly
lemons
said
the
young
man
and
do
what
i
can
i
can
not
shake
him
out
of
the
gloom
into
which
he
has
fallen
it
s
strange
the
young
man
continued
but
poor
old
father
seems
the
only
person
who
did
not
cheer
up
when
the
world
became
possible
again
it
was
a
nasty
shock
for
him
being
banished
from
court
and
although
they
ve
taken
him
back
and
given
him
another
suppose
he
s
getting
old
and
then
those
glan
s
face
became
serious
for
a
moment
however
they
mean
nothing
i
m
sure
and
now
you
are
here
you
d
like
to
see
our
possible
country
wouldn
t
you
i
m
afraid
as
you
are
from
the
impossible
world
you
ll
have
to
get
a
pass
before
you
can
come
into
the
that
ll
be
all
right
you
must
come
and
have
tea
with
us
i
opened
a
little
baker
s
and
s
business
when
father
lost
his
place
at
court
and
i
still
keep
it
work
making
puff
pastry
and
currant
buns
i
run
a
special
line
in
puffs
i
used
to
do
a
lovely
line
in
lemon
but
i
ve
had
to
leave
them
off
since
father
s
had
those
dreams
he
can
t
bear
to
be
he
stopped
a
little
out
of
breath
we
d
love
to
come
up
to
the
city
where
can
we
get
a
pass
said
molly
but
i
say
what
about
that
thing
we
were
following
broke
in
jack
suddenly
remembering
what
it
was
they
had
followed
through
the
tree
the
interest
of
meeting
their
new
acquaintances
had
made
the
children
forget
for
a
few
minutes
we
d
forgotten
hadn
t
we
molly
we
were
really
following
a
pumpkin
you
know
he
said
turning
to
the
young
man
a
what
and
the
young
man
s
voice
rose
to
a
shriek
and
his
eyes
grew
round
a
pumpkin
faltered
jack
a
little
dismayed
a
grey
father
father
it
s
come
back
shouted
the
young
man
wheeling
round
excitedly
come
back
repeated
the
old
man
rising
to
his
feet
and
stumbling
toward
them
come
back
what
has
come
back
not
the
pumpkin
gasped
glan
his
fat
jolly
face
pale
and
his
hands
trembling
oh
my
heart
and
soul
cried
the
old
man
his
eyes
wild
with
fear
wringing
his
hands
together
what
did
i
warn
you
what
did
i
warn
you
i
said
those
lemons
meant
trouble
oh
my
heart
and
soul
what
shall
we
do
the
father
and
son
stared
wildly
into
each
other
s
eyes
for
a
second
what
shall
we
do
glan
what
shall
we
do
the
old
man
quavered
shaking
from
head
to
foot
where
has
the
pumpkin
gone
asked
glan
turning
to
the
children
we
don
t
know
said
molly
frightened
at
the
distress
of
the
two
men
it
came
through
the
tree
before
us
we
followed
it
and
by
the
time
we
got
through
it
had
i
must
go
and
spread
the
alarm
i
must
go
and
warn
oh
my
heart
and
soul
the
old
man
sobbed
and
turning
he
stumbled
out
on
to
the
white
road
and
waddled
rapidly
up
the
hill
toward
the
walls
of
the
city
mumbling
and
chattering
and
sobbing
to
himself
the
keys
at
his
belt
jangling
a
dismal
accompaniment
if
it
s
back
then
the
country
will
be
impossible
again
groaned
glan
it
was
through
the
grey
pumpkin
that
it
became
impossible
before
but
just
tell
me
did
it
happen
what
do
you
know
about
the
pumpkin
and
where
did
you
first
see
it
the
children
explained
as
quickly
as
they
could
while
glan
stood
nodding
his
head
and
glancing
every
other
second
over
his
shoulder
at
the
receding
figure
of
his
father
i
wondered
how
you
discovered
the
three
knocks
on
the
tree
he
muttered
it
can
only
be
done
when
the
moon
is
full
you
know
you
didn
t
know
i
thought
you
might
have
discovered
it
accidentally
when
you
were
playing
p
raps
somebody
from
the
impossible
world
did
that
years
ago
well
go
the
children
finished
their
story
oh
it
s
the
pumpkin
right
enough
said
glan
now
what
can
have
happened
old
nancy
must
have
forgotten
the
usual
sunset
spell
no
no
she
d
never
forget
she
s
never
forgotten
there
must
be
foul
play
somewhere
we
must
go
to
her
at
once
and
see
what
s
happened
come
and
followed
by
the
two
children
he
hurriedly
crossed
the
road
to
the
little
cottage
opposite
and
rapped
loudly
with
his
knuckles
on
the
door
chapter
iv
old
nancy
slept
through
the
sunset
there
was
no
sound
from
within
the
cottage
and
the
three
waited
impatiently
for
a
second
or
two
then
glan
rapped
again
more
loudly
the
sound
of
his
knuckles
against
the
little
brown
door
rang
sharp
and
clear
in
the
quiet
of
the
evening
they
waited
glan
called
nancy
and
is
any
one
in
but
as
there
was
still
no
answer
he
lifted
the
latch
and
discovered
that
the
door
was
unbolted
he
pushed
it
open
they
found
themselves
in
an
room
full
of
shadows
cast
by
the
flickering
firelight
the
trees
outside
the
house
excluded
the
faint
so
that
the
room
was
dim
and
nothing
could
be
clearly
defined
in
the
farther
corners
a
quaint
fireplace
took
up
nearly
one
side
of
the
room
and
in
a
chair
by
the
hearth
there
sat
a
figure
nancy
old
nancy
said
glan
breathlessly
stepping
further
into
the
room
what
s
the
matter
nancy
the
figure
remained
motionless
he
bent
over
it
shaking
it
gently
by
the
shoulder
there
s
something
queer
about
this
by
thunder
he
exclaimed
peering
closer
she
no
she
s
not
she
s
breathing
he
stood
back
and
gazed
at
the
sleeping
figure
earnestly
it
s
not
a
natural
sleep
though
i
don
t
like
it
at
all
if
i
m
not
greatly
mistaken
the
grey
pumpkin
has
had
something
to
do
with
what
shall
we
do
said
molly
in
an
awed
whisper
if
it
is
any
way
possible
we
wake
her
somehow
nancy
nancy
wake
up
cried
glan
and
he
shook
her
arm
again
there
was
such
despair
in
his
voice
that
the
children
took
courage
to
move
toward
the
sleeping
nancy
to
try
and
help
him
the
light
from
the
fire
shed
a
dull
red
glow
over
old
nancy
and
looking
at
her
molly
thought
she
had
the
sweetest
face
she
had
ever
seen
though
much
wrinkled
her
skin
was
clear
and
her
expression
full
of
kindliness
and
quiet
strength
her
hair
was
pure
white
and
peeped
out
from
beneath
a
snowy
mob
cap
oh
do
please
wake
up
said
molly
laying
her
hand
on
old
nancy
s
lap
old
nancy
stirred
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
gave
a
great
sigh
then
she
slowly
opened
her
eyes
her
gaze
travelled
from
molly
to
jack
and
then
on
to
glan
she
sat
up
then
passed
her
hand
across
her
eyes
and
stared
dazed
in
front
of
her
for
a
moment
her
glance
came
back
to
molly
who
are
you
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
what
s
the
matter
it
was
glan
who
answered
the
sun
has
set
he
said
gravely
and
you
were
with
a
cry
old
nancy
started
to
her
feet
no
no
glan
it
can
t
be
true
she
exclaimed
oh
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
it
can
not
be
sunset
she
crossed
hurriedly
to
the
window
and
peered
through
a
glance
at
the
darkening
countryside
was
sufficient
she
turned
away
and
creeping
back
to
her
chair
sank
into
it
and
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
room
a
cinder
fell
out
of
the
fire
on
to
the
red
hearth
well
glan
cleared
his
throat
and
tried
to
speak
cheerfully
what
isn
t
well
must
be
made
well
you
know
no
good
crying
over
spilt
milk
old
nancy
come
come
snap
your
fingers
at
adversity
you
know
we
must
all
put
our
heads
together
and
see
what
we
can
do
what
s
the
best
thing
to
do
first
he
smiled
bravely
and
jack
and
molly
took
heart
and
things
looked
brighter
although
they
scarcely
knew
what
all
the
trouble
meant
is
it
back
then
asked
old
nancy
raising
her
head
the
pumpkin
it
s
back
said
glan
then
there
s
not
a
moment
to
be
lost
said
old
nancy
firmly
and
with
an
effort
she
pulled
herself
together
and
sat
up
straight
how
did
it
going
to
sleep
inquired
glan
i
don
t
know
said
old
nancy
with
a
puzzled
frown
never
have
i
missed
doing
the
spell
at
sunset
i
think
i
must
have
been
drugged
the
pumpkin
must
still
have
a
few
followers
in
the
one
of
them
drugged
i
don
t
know
how
they
did
it
they
must
have
chosen
the
opportunity
carefully
so
that
i
fell
asleep
just
before
sunset
i
remember
looking
out
and
seeing
the
sun
about
half
an
hour
before
sunset
time
and
then
i
sat
down
for
a
few
minutes
and
i
don
t
remember
anything
more
when
did
the
pumpkin
come
back
about
half
an
hour
ago
said
glan
he
came
through
the
tree
said
jack
and
we
followed
you
are
from
the
impossible
world
then
murmured
old
nancy
where
i
sent
the
pumpkin
but
will
be
the
impossible
world
again
soon
i
fear
she
looked
earnestly
into
the
faces
of
the
two
children
then
she
smiled
faintly
will
you
stay
and
help
us
she
asked
help
us
to
make
our
world
possible
again
we
ll
stay
rather
began
jack
about
mother
molly
interrupted
i
will
tell
you
the
history
of
the
pumpkin
first
of
all
said
old
nancy
and
then
you
shall
decide
whether
you
will
stay
and
help
us
or
go
home
if
you
decide
to
stay
i
will
see
that
your
mother
is
not
made
anxious
about
you
until
your
work
is
finished
and
you
return
to
her
but
meanwhile
glan
what
are
you
going
to
do
father
has
already
gone
to
arouse
the
city
said
glan
i
think
i
will
follow
him
and
see
what
i
can
do
then
i
will
come
back
and
see
what
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
have
decided
but
before
they
can
do
a
thing
they
must
hear
the
pumpkin
s
story
from
so
saying
he
took
off
his
cap
with
a
flourish
and
opened
the
door
keep
up
heart
laugh
at
misfortune
remember
we
shall
win
he
cried
his
fat
face
all
and
he
was
gone
sit
down
on
the
rug
said
old
nancy
and
tell
me
first
of
all
what
you
know
about
the
pumpkin
and
then
i
will
tell
you
why
it
is
the
pumpkin
is
so
dreaded
in
our
country
and
how
he
came
to
be
what
he
so
jack
and
molly
sat
down
on
the
rug
and
after
relating
what
they
knew
of
the
pumpkin
and
how
they
happened
to
come
across
him
they
listened
while
old
nancy
told
them
the
following
story
fascinated
by
her
low
sweet
voice
and
her
kind
eyes
chapter
v
explains
who
is
inside
the
grey
long
ago
began
old
nancy
gazing
dreamily
into
the
fire
a
great
king
ruled
over
this
country
who
had
an
only
daughter
to
whom
he
was
passionately
attached
she
was
a
sweet
frail
little
delicate
in
spite
of
all
the
care
and
attention
bestowed
upon
her
she
grew
no
stronger
indeed
as
time
passed
she
seemed
to
grow
weaker
and
weaker
until
at
length
it
became
obvious
to
all
that
the
princess
was
dying
the
king
was
in
despair
all
that
love
money
doctors
and
nurses
could
do
for
her
was
all
in
vain
then
one
evening
someone
found
a
shabby
old
book
at
the
back
of
a
shelf
in
the
royal
library
to
whom
it
belonged
and
how
it
got
there
no
one
seemed
to
know
but
anyway
the
book
proved
of
priceless
value
as
it
contained
a
remarkable
recipe
for
curing
just
such
an
illness
as
the
princess
was
suffering
from
i
need
not
tell
you
all
about
this
recipe
now
it
is
sufficient
that
one
of
the
most
important
items
juice
needless
to
say
the
king
seized
eagerly
at
any
chance
to
save
his
daughter
s
life
and
so
all
the
pumpkins
available
were
quickly
purchased
and
the
recipe
made
up
and
a
dose
of
this
new
cure
was
given
to
the
princess
from
the
very
first
dose
there
was
a
marked
change
for
the
better
and
with
perseverance
this
new
remedy
gradually
worked
wonders
in
the
princess
she
grew
stronger
and
stronger
and
was
soon
on
the
road
to
a
complete
recovery
and
but
first
you
must
know
that
in
order
to
have
plenty
of
pumpkins
on
hand
to
complete
the
cure
the
delighted
king
had
a
special
garden
made
in
which
to
grow
nothing
but
pumpkins
and
he
employed
a
special
staff
of
gardeners
to
look
after
this
garden
and
every
day
he
would
go
to
the
garden
himself
to
see
how
the
pumpkins
were
getting
on
one
night
a
fearful
storm
swept
over
the
country
and
while
the
thunder
growled
and
the
lightning
flashed
and
the
wind
and
rain
struggled
for
strange
things
were
taking
place
down
in
the
pumpkin
garden
for
when
morning
was
not
a
single
pumpkin
left
in
the
garden
nor
in
the
whole
of
the
country
apparently
but
it
was
not
the
storm
that
had
destroyed
them
all
under
cover
of
the
black
night
and
the
storm
somebody
had
come
and
had
deliberately
cut
off
the
pumpkins
and
destroyed
them
now
this
he
was
not
discovered
for
days
an
evil
little
dwarf
man
who
imagined
that
he
owed
the
king
a
sought
to
punish
him
this
way
nor
was
this
all
when
the
princess
s
nurse
went
to
fetch
her
was
none
left
all
the
bottles
were
smashed
to
pieces
and
the
precious
liquid
was
spilled
all
over
the
floor
the
king
was
terribly
upset
and
sent
messengers
far
and
wide
post
haste
to
try
to
get
some
more
pumpkins
but
they
could
not
get
any
and
from
that
time
as
each
hour
passed
the
princess
began
to
decline
again
she
got
steadily
worse
and
weaker
and
weaker
as
days
went
by
you
can
imagine
what
grief
it
must
have
been
to
her
father
to
see
her
losing
her
health
to
see
her
cheeks
growing
pale
and
thin
see
her
gradually
fading
away
he
made
every
attempt
possible
to
get
hold
of
a
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
pumpkins
in
the
land
had
suddenly
vanished
at
length
the
princess
lay
at
death
s
door
the
doctors
gravely
shook
their
heads
at
each
other
while
the
king
paced
ceaselessly
up
and
down
the
corridor
outside
her
room
he
was
waiting
thus
torn
with
anxiety
and
suspense
when
a
messenger
arrived
at
the
palace
with
a
note
for
the
king
which
contained
the
news
that
a
pumpkin
had
been
found
the
owner
of
the
pumpkin
would
give
it
up
to
no
one
but
the
king
himself
the
note
continued
would
his
majesty
kindly
walk
down
into
a
certain
part
of
the
city
and
go
to
a
certain
house
the
address
was
given
where
he
would
be
met
by
someone
who
would
place
the
pumpkin
in
the
kings
hands
the
king
wondering
why
the
person
who
had
the
pumpkin
did
not
hasten
with
it
to
the
palace
nevertheless
did
not
wait
to
question
but
went
at
once
to
the
house
down
in
the
city
it
was
a
quaint
stubby
little
house
and
inside
he
found
a
little
dwarf
man
the
king
did
not
know
at
the
time
that
this
was
the
person
who
had
destroyed
the
pumpkin
garden
on
the
night
of
the
storm
anyway
the
dwarf
began
immediately
to
pour
out
some
of
the
grievances
that
he
imagined
he
had
against
the
king
and
then
he
discovered
that
the
king
was
not
to
blame
at
all
there
was
some
sort
of
muddle
and
misunderstanding
and
one
of
the
grievances
the
king
had
never
even
heard
about
when
the
dwarf
realized
that
he
had
endangered
the
princess
s
life
for
no
reason
that
it
had
all
been
a
mistake
and
that
he
had
no
cause
at
all
for
the
spiteful
and
wicked
thing
he
had
done
he
got
unreasonably
angry
as
people
often
do
when
they
have
wronged
someone
who
hasn
t
deserved
it
and
so
the
dwarf
fell
to
blaming
and
cursing
the
king
and
finally
tried
to
make
a
bargain
with
him
concerning
the
pumpkin
which
he
had
hidden
he
said
refusing
to
disclose
its
until
his
demands
were
granted
the
king
whose
sole
idea
was
to
get
the
pumpkin
as
quickly
as
possible
first
pleaded
then
commanded
the
dwarf
to
fetch
the
pumpkin
immediately
he
was
willing
to
give
any
price
for
his
daughter
s
sake
but
still
the
dwarf
haggled
and
delayed
until
the
king
lost
all
patience
and
a
fierce
quarrel
ensued
in
the
midst
of
their
quarrel
there
came
the
clattering
of
horses
hoofs
on
the
cobbled
road
without
and
then
someone
rapped
at
the
door
of
the
dwarfs
house
the
angry
voices
within
ceased
and
in
the
silence
that
followed
a
bell
could
be
heard
tolling
and
the
king
learnt
that
his
daughter
was
dead
he
returned
to
the
palace
telling
the
messengers
to
arrest
the
dwarf
and
place
him
in
the
palace
dungeon
for
i
shall
hold
you
responsible
for
my
daughter
s
death
said
the
king
afterward
when
the
whole
story
of
the
dwarf
s
treachery
became
public
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
not
been
alone
on
the
night
of
the
storm
others
had
helped
him
to
destroy
the
pumpkins
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
him
to
make
such
a
clean
sweep
of
all
the
pumpkins
in
the
countryside
by
himself
it
had
been
a
carefully
organized
plan
of
which
the
dwarf
was
the
ringleader
and
originator
but
none
of
the
others
were
half
so
blameworthy
as
the
dwarf
they
obeyed
his
orders
without
knowing
his
motives
and
did
not
realize
the
mischief
they
were
doing
was
so
serious
one
or
two
of
them
were
arrested
and
received
light
punishments
some
the
authorities
could
not
find
but
the
gravest
offender
was
the
dwarf
of
course
and
for
him
was
reserved
the
heaviest
punishment
and
this
was
his
punishment
the
pumpkin
that
was
found
hidden
in
his
garden
the
last
remaining
pumpkin
in
the
country
was
brought
to
the
palace
and
with
the
help
of
a
little
magic
the
dwarf
was
shut
up
the
he
remains
to
this
day
they
say
that
when
the
dwarf
found
what
his
fate
was
to
be
he
got
very
enraged
and
vowed
that
if
this
punishment
was
carried
out
he
would
make
the
king
and
his
people
rue
it
and
suffer
for
it
for
ever
and
ever
his
threat
was
laughed
at
and
the
punishment
duly
carried
out
about
that
time
a
weird
old
magician
happened
to
pass
through
the
country
and
his
aid
was
secured
to
help
with
the
punishment
he
made
a
spell
and
the
big
yellow
pumpkin
slowly
a
its
own
accord
the
little
dwarf
was
lifted
struggling
and
screaming
and
placed
in
the
centre
the
magician
waved
his
hands
and
the
pumpkin
closed
to
again
the
magician
waved
his
hands
again
and
a
curious
grey
shade
crept
over
the
pumpkin
and
it
is
this
grey
shade
that
keeps
the
dwarf
imprisoned
he
might
force
his
way
even
his
way
out
who
the
pumpkin
were
still
yellow
the
grey
is
part
of
the
magic
illustration
the
little
dwarf
was
lifted
struggling
and
screaming
well
the
king
then
called
a
council
of
wise
men
together
to
consider
what
should
be
done
with
the
grey
pumpkin
some
were
for
keeping
it
in
a
museum
and
charging
a
fee
of
for
visitors
to
go
and
look
at
it
while
others
advised
burying
it
away
in
the
deepest
dungeon
of
the
city
just
in
case
the
dwarf
ever
got
out
of
the
pumpkin
while
a
third
section
of
the
council
deriding
the
two
former
suggestions
urged
that
the
grey
pumpkin
be
flung
into
a
ditch
beside
the
high
road
outside
the
city
gates
the
spokesman
for
this
last
section
was
a
brilliant
reckless
young
man
an
eloquent
speaker
he
laughed
at
the
caution
which
prompted
the
first
two
parties
to
suggest
a
museum
or
a
dungeon
and
looked
upon
the
latter
as
a
grave
reflection
on
the
magician
who
had
so
kindly
come
to
their
aid
did
they
not
trust
in
the
spell
which
kept
the
pumpkin
tightly
closed
he
asked
the
council
and
besides
what
person
dwarf
man
woman
or
child
would
be
alive
after
being
shut
up
in
a
pumpkin
for
hours
no
let
them
show
their
scorn
for
the
thing
by
flinging
it
away
outside
the
walls
of
their
city
much
more
than
this
did
the
young
man
say
and
in
the
end
he
gained
his
way
the
grey
pumpkin
was
carried
to
the
gates
of
the
city
escorted
by
a
solemn
procession
and
thrown
into
a
ditch
outside
the
walls
amid
much
hissing
and
booing
from
the
populace
the
young
councillor
who
had
suggested
all
this
got
carried
away
by
the
excitement
of
the
moment
and
he
dashed
forward
and
gave
the
grey
pumpkin
that
was
lying
quietly
at
the
bottom
of
the
ditch
a
good
hearty
kick
this
act
was
greeted
with
cheers
and
shouts
of
approval
from
the
crowd
until
they
saw
that
the
pumpkin
which
had
been
sent
spinning
had
landed
on
the
high
road
a
dozen
yards
away
and
was
slowly
rolling
down
the
hill
the
crowd
fell
silent
and
watched
on
on
the
grey
pumpkin
rolled
down
the
hill
from
the
city
past
my
cottage
on
until
it
disappeared
at
length
into
a
dark
forest
right
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
high
road
and
after
that
all
our
troubles
began
the
dwarf
kept
his
vow
and
made
us
suffer
somewhere
down
in
that
dark
forest
he
got
hold
of
some
black
one
knows
how
or
who
helped
him
all
we
know
is
that
since
that
time
he
has
become
possessed
of
certain
magic
powers
and
that
one
misfortune
after
another
has
overtaken
our
caused
by
the
pumpkin
wherever
he
goes
he
makes
misery
and
mischief
i
can
not
tell
you
all
the
horrible
things
he
has
done
he
and
his
little
band
of
faithful
few
who
helped
him
in
the
beginning
to
destroy
the
pumpkins
you
remember
they
went
right
over
to
his
side
after
they
were
punished
and
he
seemed
to
gain
some
evil
influence
over
them
there
are
not
many
of
them
but
they
are
in
all
parts
of
the
country
ready
to
help
him
when
he
needs
them
and
with
his
knowledge
of
magic
he
could
so
disguise
them
that
we
could
not
recognize
them
but
they
are
powerless
without
him
and
when
after
suffering
him
for
a
long
time
because
we
could
not
find
a
way
to
escape
him
we
finally
discovered
a
way
of
banishing
the
grey
pumpkin
out
of
our
world
into
your
world
where
he
could
do
no
harm
his
followers
became
practically
harmless
until
that
is
the
story
of
how
the
grey
pumpkin
came
to
be
what
he
is
the
king
whom
he
hated
has
been
dead
many
years
and
another
king
reigns
in
his
stead
and
the
young
councillor
the
eloquent
young
councillor
who
advised
the
people
so
unwisely
was
banished
from
court
he
has
grown
old
and
timid
and
querulous
and
is
a
disappointed
man
whose
career
was
blighted
at
the
outset
through
the
pumpkin
you
have
seen
this
once
reckless
dashing
young
man
you
met
him
just
now
in
the
wood
he
is
glan
s
chapter
vi
black
what
dreadful
things
the
pumpkin
must
do
said
molly
to
make
every
one
so
frightened
of
he
does
do
dreadful
things
said
old
nancy
what
a
mean
innocent
people
jack
commented
and
the
worst
part
of
it
is
old
nancy
continued
that
no
one
knows
how
much
evil
power
he
has
nor
what
he
can
do
to
them
if
he
likes
he
evidently
has
his
limits
for
there
seem
to
be
some
things
that
he
can
not
do
for
instance
he
can
not
roll
along
always
moves
at
the
same
slow
pace
and
he
can
not
climb
up
walls
or
trees
though
he
can
roll
up
hills
so
as
long
as
you
keep
out
of
his
reach
he
can
not
hurt
if
he
never
comes
out
of
the
little
does
he
do
when
he
catches
any
one
inquired
molly
just
rolls
up
to
them
and
touches
against
them
queer
happens
to
them
perhaps
they
are
changed
into
some
strange
animal
or
maybe
they
shrink
until
they
are
only
a
few
inches
high
or
suddenly
they
find
they
have
lost
their
nose
or
their
worse
things
than
these
may
happen
the
misery
caused
by
the
pumpkin
is
unthinkable
and
more
often
than
oh
shuddered
molly
well
however
did
you
manage
to
get
rid
of
him
send
him
into
our
world
i
was
just
going
to
tell
you
about
that
said
old
nancy
there
was
a
moment
s
pause
then
i
am
a
kind
of
magician
you
know
she
went
on
the
children
glanced
quickly
up
at
her
startled
at
her
words
but
her
gentle
face
reassured
them
as
she
smiled
kindly
down
and
being
a
kind
of
magician
i
discovered
a
spell
that
would
send
the
pumpkin
out
of
our
country
into
the
impossible
world
so
i
turned
him
into
a
pincushion
a
grey
pincushion
and
transported
him
into
your
world
where
i
thought
he
could
do
no
harm
and
you
know
what
happened
there
i
believed
we
were
rid
of
him
for
ever
and
we
would
have
for
me
it
was
part
of
the
spell
that
every
evening
at
sunset
i
should
stand
with
my
face
turned
to
the
sinking
sun
and
making
a
certain
sign
with
my
arms
outstretched
should
repeat
some
magic
words
as
long
as
i
did
this
each
evening
the
pumpkin
could
not
come
back
and
our
country
was
safe
but
i
knew
that
if
i
chanced
to
be
a
minute
after
sunset
any
evening
the
spell
which
bound
the
pumpkin
would
break
and
he
would
return
to
a
sorrowful
look
came
over
old
nancy
s
face
and
she
said
i
failed
to
say
the
magic
words
at
he
has
come
back
i
am
certain
it
is
one
of
the
pumpkin
s
followers
who
has
foiled
me
though
do
not
can
t
you
use
the
spell
and
turn
him
into
a
pincushion
again
asked
jack
no
said
old
nancy
shaking
her
head
that
spell
could
only
be
used
once
and
once
only
and
i
know
no
then
however
can
began
jack
patience
said
old
nancy
there
is
one
way
of
thwarting
the
pumpkin
which
everybody
in
our
country
knows
of
but
they
can
t
do
it
because
they
can
t
find
the
black
leaf
you
must
know
that
when
the
little
dwarf
was
thrust
into
the
pumpkin
the
plant
in
the
dwarf
s
garden
on
which
the
pumpkin
had
grown
immediately
turned
black
for
thirteen
days
it
remained
so
bearing
one
solitary
giant
all
at
once
it
vanished
and
now
each
year
it
comes
up
in
a
different
part
of
the
this
one
immense
black
it
remains
for
thirteen
days
and
then
it
disappears
again
we
have
not
looked
for
it
these
last
few
has
been
no
need
still
some
people
have
seen
it
but
now
we
want
it
badly
for
if
you
can
find
the
black
leaf
and
pluck
it
you
have
but
to
turn
your
face
to
the
west
and
say
some
words
which
i
can
tell
you
and
wherever
the
pumpkin
is
he
will
be
compelled
to
come
to
you
then
you
must
touch
him
with
the
leaf
have
him
in
your
power
we
were
in
despair
before
when
no
one
could
find
the
black
leaf
until
i
discovered
that
spell
and
now
as
i
know
no
other
spell
we
shall
be
in
despair
till
someone
does
find
the
black
leaf
and
that
is
what
i
want
you
both
to
stay
and
help
us
do
strangers
are
often
oh
we
stay
and
help
cried
jack
impulsively
mustn
t
we
molly
i
should
love
to
said
molly
but
couldn
t
we
just
let
mother
know
so
that
she
wouldn
t
be
anxious
if
you
decide
to
stay
said
old
nancy
i
will
take
care
that
your
mother
is
not
worried
in
any
way
by
your
absence
i
will
send
a
message
to
then
we
ll
stay
decided
both
children
at
once
i
am
so
glad
old
nancy
said
simply
and
now
if
either
of
you
should
be
lucky
enough
to
find
the
black
leaf
remember
what
to
do
pluck
it
immediately
and
stand
with
your
face
toward
the
west
and
say
come
to
me
grey
pumpkin
i
command
you
by
the
black
leaf
you
can
remember
that
jack
and
molly
repeated
it
to
make
sure
and
then
old
nancy
went
on
when
the
pumpkin
he
must
toward
you
touch
him
with
the
leaf
quickly
before
he
can
touch
you
then
he
can
not
harm
you
but
will
be
compelled
to
follow
you
wherever
you
lead
and
where
should
we
lead
him
asked
molly
bring
him
to
me
said
old
nancy
grimly
there
was
something
i
wanted
to
ask
you
said
jack
and
i
can
t
think
what
it
was
now
oh
i
know
does
the
pumpkin
know
where
the
black
leaf
is
we
are
not
quite
sure
about
that
but
even
if
he
does
it
is
evidently
of
no
use
to
him
i
mean
he
dare
not
would
be
fatal
to
him
but
he
can
guard
it
if
he
knows
where
it
is
and
try
to
prevent
you
getting
it
and
this
is
what
he
will
try
to
do
whether
he
knows
where
it
is
or
not
he
is
sure
to
try
to
delay
you
or
trap
you
as
soon
as
he
discovers
that
you
are
searching
for
the
leaf
and
he
will
soon
know
what
you
are
trying
to
of
his
followers
will
tell
him
you
may
be
sure
so
beware
of
the
pumpkin
and
his
little
band
of
people
you
are
in
less
danger
of
being
caught
by
the
pumpkin
than
you
are
by
one
of
his
band
because
you
will
know
the
pumpkin
when
you
see
him
but
you
won
t
know
which
are
his
decoys
his
spies
and
which
are
not
and
i
can
t
help
you
about
this
you
must
simply
be
very
very
careful
and
do
not
trust
anyone
until
you
are
sure
of
course
people
like
glan
and
his
father
or
anyone
inside
the
city
are
quite
all
nobody
will
be
allowed
within
the
city
gates
now
without
a
pass
and
they
can
not
get
a
pass
if
they
are
one
of
the
pumpkin
s
mightn
t
one
of
the
pumpkin
s
people
find
the
leaf
inquired
jack
they
dare
not
touch
it
either
even
if
they
do
know
where
it
is
replied
old
nancy
but
they
can
guard
the
pumpkin
if
the
black
leaf
only
appears
for
thirteen
days
each
year
how
do
you
know
which
thirteen
days
they
are
asked
molly
thoughtfully
because
the
thirteen
days
start
on
the
anniversary
of
the
day
on
which
the
little
dwarf
was
put
inside
the
pumpkin
said
old
nancy
and
as
fate
decrees
it
was
the
anniversary
yesterday
the
black
leaf
is
somewhere
above
ground
oh
i
do
hope
and
trust
you
will
be
successful
my
old
nancy
clasped
her
hands
together
nervously
and
don
t
be
ashamed
to
if
the
pumpkin
tries
to
catch
you
before
the
leaf
is
found
you
are
powerless
against
him
and
his
you
have
the
leaf
but
he
can
only
use
his
magic
and
hurt
you
if
he
touches
you
remember
so
don
t
let
him
touch
you
we
ll
all
right
if
we
see
him
coming
said
jack
or
else
we
ll
climb
up
a
tree
or
well
that
s
a
good
idea
too
said
old
nancy
i
suppose
it
s
really
a
sort
of
work
we
re
going
to
do
said
molly
it
is
dangerous
and
very
brave
of
you
to
attempt
it
old
nancy
said
it
needs
courage
and
perseverance
i
think
you
both
have
pluck
and
you
both
have
perseverance
somehow
i
think
only
of
you
will
be
which
one
cried
jack
and
molly
eagerly
ah
old
nancy
replied
and
shook
her
head
mysteriously
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
than
that
but
now
we
must
get
to
work
immediately
there
is
no
time
to
be
lost
wait
here
for
a
she
rose
and
smiling
at
the
children
made
her
way
across
the
firelit
room
and
passed
out
through
a
doorway
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
jack
and
molly
sat
still
and
gazed
silently
round
the
shadowy
room
they
could
never
afterward
describe
the
feeling
that
came
over
them
alone
in
that
to
themselves
they
were
not
afraid
a
curious
feeling
crept
over
them
and
they
both
felt
sure
that
there
was
something
or
someone
in
the
room
with
them
although
they
felt
equally
sure
there
was
no
one
there
was
an
air
of
mystery
and
secrecy
in
the
room
no
shadows
danced
on
walls
quite
in
the
way
that
they
danced
in
old
nancy
s
room
no
smoke
curled
in
such
weird
and
fantastic
shapes
as
the
smoke
that
curled
up
the
wide
chimney
in
front
of
them
while
it
almost
seemed
ridiculous
to
say
that
the
chairs
were
empty
when
the
in
the
room
crowded
into
each
of
them
i
am
a
kind
of
magician
you
know
repeated
molly
softly
nodding
her
head
at
jack
do
you
know
i
can
that
she
so
can
i
whispered
jack
hoarsely
the
children
looked
at
each
other
seriously
for
a
few
seconds
then
they
turned
their
heads
and
saw
that
old
nancy
was
standing
in
the
doorway
watching
them
she
came
forward
into
the
firelight
and
they
saw
that
she
carried
two
small
satchels
in
her
hands
they
were
something
like
the
children
s
school
satchels
only
they
were
smaller
and
stronger
in
appearance
being
made
of
soft
black
leather
they
had
long
straps
attached
to
them
to
pass
over
the
shoulders
these
are
your
knapsacks
said
old
nancy
smiling
you
will
find
them
useful
on
your
journey
this
is
yours
she
said
to
molly
and
this
is
yours
to
jack
now
if
you
will
open
them
and
take
out
what
is
inside
i
will
explain
what
they
are
meant
the
children
thanked
her
and
eagerly
unbuckled
their
satchels
and
felt
inside
the
contents
of
each
were
the
same
a
sealed
envelope
a
box
of
matches
and
a
little
packet
of
square
brown
things
that
looked
like
caramels
inside
the
envelopes
are
your
passes
into
the
city
give
them
up
at
the
city
gates
take
care
of
them
without
them
they
would
not
let
you
in
the
matches
in
those
two
boxes
are
not
quite
ordinary
they
look
like
ordinary
ones
i
think
they
ll
help
you
over
one
or
two
difficulties
use
them
carefully
as
there
are
not
many
matches
in
each
box
whatever
you
do
don
t
light
them
in
the
daytime
but
light
them
when
you
are
in
the
dark
and
want
to
do
we
strike
them
just
in
the
ordinary
way
asked
molly
just
in
the
ordinary
way
said
old
nancy
and
the
little
brown
squares
in
the
packets
are
for
you
to
eat
should
you
be
very
hungry
and
unable
to
obtain
food
you
will
find
them
wonderfully
is
something
i
make
specially
and
here
she
continued
turning
to
jack
and
holding
something
out
to
him
is
another
shoe
for
you
i
see
you
have
only
got
one
why
so
i
have
cried
jack
noticing
for
the
first
time
that
one
of
his
slippers
was
missing
now
wherever
did
i
lose
that
i
wonder
poor
little
slipper
it
takes
no
part
in
these
adventures
as
it
is
left
behind
in
the
impossible
world
it
is
lying
by
the
fence
at
the
bottom
of
the
children
s
garden
you
remember
i
never
noticed
it
before
thanks
awfully
though
this
slipper
fits
splendidly
how
did
you
know
my
size
oh
i
knew
old
nancy
laughed
and
would
say
no
more
she
helped
the
children
buckle
on
their
satchels
telling
them
that
once
they
were
inside
the
city
they
would
learn
what
plans
were
being
made
for
the
search
i
wish
i
could
give
you
some
magic
charm
to
defend
you
against
the
pumpkin
she
said
but
that
is
impossible
the
black
leaf
is
the
only
thing
that
can
harm
him
and
save
us
all
be
very
careful
dear
children
ah
she
broke
off
with
a
sharp
exclamation
what
is
it
what
s
the
matter
cried
jack
and
molly
as
old
nancy
stood
gazing
at
her
left
hand
which
she
held
out
in
front
of
her
so
that
s
how
it
was
done
she
cried
look
look
and
she
held
her
hand
toward
them
a
dark
grey
mark
stained
the
middle
finger
from
base
to
tip
what
is
it
molly
repeated
the
stain
whispered
old
nancy
excitedly
do
you
see
it
s
grey
the
grey
pumpkin
s
mark
it
one
of
his
spies
then
who
made
me
sleep
through
the
sunset
hour
but
why
should
they
have
been
able
to
do
this
when
they
have
been
powerless
for
so
long
she
muttered
to
herself
could
anything
have
happened
to
the
pumpkin
your
world
that
enabled
him
to
exert
his
evil
magic
all
the
way
into
our
world
and
so
the
spies
were
able
to
begin
their
black
magic
again
can
you
think
of
anything
that
happened
she
asked
molly
eagerly
molly
tried
hard
to
think
of
something
of
course
as
it
was
a
stuck
a
pin
in
it
she
said
presently
old
nancy
gazed
at
her
strangely
in
the
moonlight
she
asked
was
the
moonlight
shining
on
it
when
you
stuck
the
pin
in
yes
said
molly
nervously
oh
did
that
do
it
oh
i
am
so
dreadfully
it
is
all
my
fault
that
the
pumpkin
has
returned
no
no
said
old
nancy
you
are
not
to
blame
how
were
you
to
know
it
was
my
fault
for
not
being
more
careful
then
they
could
not
have
drugged
she
crossed
quickly
to
the
window
on
the
sill
there
s
a
trace
of
grey
powder
i
know
what
has
happened
when
i
went
out
of
this
room
earlier
in
the
did
for
a
few
minutes
i
just
before
sunset
must
have
opened
the
window
and
scattered
the
powder
on
the
sill
hoping
that
i
should
go
to
the
window
at
sunset
and
that
i
should
put
my
hand
on
the
sill
and
touch
the
powder
and
i
did
and
the
powder
must
have
been
magic
and
made
me
go
to
sleep
i
wonder
i
never
noticed
it
but
never
mind
now
never
mind
now
it
is
too
late
we
must
get
to
work
at
once
to
remedy
the
but
molly
still
had
a
feeling
that
it
was
partly
her
fault
and
she
was
glad
that
she
and
jack
had
decided
to
stay
she
felt
it
was
the
least
they
could
try
to
find
the
black
leaf
as
glan
had
not
returned
they
decided
to
start
out
for
the
hour
was
getting
late
and
old
nancy
thought
it
would
be
wiser
for
them
to
be
inside
the
city
as
soon
as
possible
she
told
them
that
they
were
almost
sure
to
meet
glan
on
the
had
evidently
been
couldn
t
miss
him
dears
said
old
nancy
my
thoughts
will
be
constantly
with
you
till
we
meet
again
good
luck
go
with
you
leaving
old
nancy
standing
in
the
doorway
with
the
firelight
glowing
warmly
in
the
room
behind
her
the
two
children
started
out
in
the
dusk
and
began
to
ascend
the
hill
chapter
vii
opens
the
gate
in
the
nick
of
the
children
walked
briskly
glancing
from
the
city
lights
to
the
dark
woods
on
either
side
of
the
road
everything
lay
quiet
and
peaceful
and
overhead
the
moon
was
now
visible
it
seemed
impossible
to
believe
that
a
cloud
of
fear
hung
over
the
city
ahead
as
they
drew
nearer
the
top
of
the
hill
the
sound
of
a
bell
tolling
came
floating
down
to
their
ears
what
s
that
for
i
wonder
said
molly
p
raps
it
s
a
sort
of
warning
suggested
jack
to
tell
people
the
pumpkin
s
back
molly
shivered
let
s
hurry
a
bit
more
shall
we
she
said
i
ll
be
glad
when
we
re
inside
the
city
won
t
you
jack
so
they
quickened
their
footsteps
i
do
hope
we
meet
glan
molly
went
on
we
couldn
t
very
well
miss
him
though
could
we
you
re
sure
you
ve
got
your
pass
safely
rather
said
jack
at
least
i
think
i
put
it
back
in
my
and
diving
his
hand
in
to
make
sure
he
jerked
the
envelope
which
contained
the
pass
out
on
to
the
road
a
passing
breeze
caught
it
and
turned
it
over
and
over
on
the
ground
and
there
was
a
hurried
scramble
on
jack
s
part
to
get
it
back
again
he
had
just
put
it
safely
back
in
his
satchel
when
a
sudden
cry
from
molly
made
him
wheel
round
to
see
what
was
the
matter
molly
was
standing
gazing
down
the
hill
oh
jack
jack
look
she
cried
pointing
to
the
dark
wood
on
their
left
about
thirty
yards
away
down
the
hill
something
was
slowly
emerging
from
the
black
shadows
of
the
trees
it
was
the
grey
pumpkin
it
rolled
leisurely
out
into
the
moonlit
road
paused
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
moved
up
the
hill
toward
them
don
t
be
ashamed
to
run
old
nancy
had
said
and
they
were
not
ashamed
jack
and
molly
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
they
did
not
want
to
be
stopped
by
the
pumpkin
at
the
very
beginning
of
their
quest
knowing
how
powerless
they
were
until
the
black
leaf
was
found
so
they
ran
with
all
their
might
on
on
until
the
city
gate
was
but
a
little
farther
ahead
of
them
and
the
tolling
bell
clanged
loudly
from
within
jack
oh
gasped
poor
molly
were
just
panted
jack
with
a
final
effort
they
rushed
forward
and
reached
the
gate
at
last
jack
flung
himself
against
it
and
started
beating
on
it
with
his
fists
and
then
snatching
up
a
large
stone
from
the
road
he
hammered
it
with
that
while
molly
seized
the
thick
bell
chain
at
the
side
and
began
pulling
it
vigorously
it
was
a
curious
like
a
door
than
a
of
solid
iron
and
at
the
top
high
above
the
children
s
heads
was
a
tiny
grating
through
which
the
citizens
could
see
who
stood
without
jack
glanced
despairingly
up
at
the
high
white
walls
and
the
black
iron
gate
while
he
continued
to
beat
wildly
with
the
stone
and
shout
as
loudly
as
he
could
for
help
there
seemed
no
way
of
escape
if
they
did
not
open
the
gate
and
looking
back
he
saw
the
pumpkin
coming
silently
onward
it
s
no
good
making
a
dash
for
the
woods
molly
he
exclaimed
he
d
cut
us
off
pull
harder
and
shout
so
molly
pulled
harder
at
the
bell
chain
and
cried
out
for
someone
to
come
and
open
the
gate
and
let
them
in
suddenly
above
the
noise
they
were
making
and
the
sound
of
the
tolling
bell
within
the
children
heard
voices
and
a
clattering
on
the
other
side
of
the
gate
then
a
face
appeared
at
the
grating
open
the
gate
cried
jack
quick
quick
we
ve
got
a
pass
open
the
gate
and
save
us
a
loud
murmuring
arose
within
and
they
heard
the
jangling
of
keys
when
all
at
once
a
voice
shrieked
look
look
on
the
hill
it
s
the
pumpkin
don
t
open
the
gate
don
t
open
the
gate
it
s
a
decoy
it
s
not
it
s
not
cried
jack
oh
save
us
save
us
we
got
a
pass
let
us
in
and
save
us
from
the
pumpkin
for
pity
s
sake
open
the
gate
the
voices
inside
were
now
loud
and
angry
the
people
were
evidently
not
inclined
to
believe
him
oh
jack
jack
screamed
molly
he
s
just
behind
us
jack
jack
wheeled
round
and
saw
to
his
horror
that
the
pumpkin
was
near
the
top
of
the
hill
and
close
upon
them
he
was
desperate
raising
the
stone
above
his
head
he
flung
it
with
all
his
strength
at
the
big
grey
moving
thing
there
was
a
dull
thud
as
the
stone
struck
the
pumpkin
and
sent
it
back
a
few
paces
but
it
quickly
came
to
a
standstill
and
began
at
once
to
cover
the
ground
it
had
lost
meanwhile
a
fresh
arrival
had
come
upon
the
scene
behind
the
gate
in
the
midst
of
all
the
hubbub
the
angry
voices
the
clanging
bell
the
pattering
feet
there
was
a
moment
s
lull
and
jack
and
molly
could
distantly
hear
the
sound
of
running
feet
then
a
familiar
voice
exclaimed
hi
there
what
s
all
the
fuss
about
a
score
of
voices
started
to
explain
molly
gave
a
sob
of
relief
oh
it
s
glan
she
cried
glan
glan
the
children
called
imploringly
open
the
gate
quick
and
save
us
oh
be
quick
glan
s
face
appeared
at
the
grating
bless
my
soul
he
cried
in
his
big
voice
here
give
me
the
keys
yes
i
know
it
s
the
pumpkin
too
but
if
we
don
t
open
the
gate
this
instant
the
little
lady
outside
and
her
brother
will
be
give
me
the
keys
give
me
the
keys
decoys
bah
there
was
a
jangling
of
keys
again
the
sound
of
a
lock
being
turned
and
the
huge
gate
swung
back
jack
and
molly
dashed
in
and
glan
slammed
the
gate
behind
in
time
another
minute
and
the
pumpkin
would
have
got
through
but
can
t
he
open
the
gate
if
he
just
touches
it
cried
jack
tugging
glan
s
sleeve
excitedly
no
no
he
can
t
do
that
glan
said
shaking
his
head
as
he
stood
on
tiptoe
to
bolt
and
padlock
the
gate
securely
thank
goodness
there
are
some
limits
to
his
magic
jack
and
molly
found
themselves
in
the
centre
of
an
excited
crowd
of
people
who
regarded
them
curiously
but
without
anger
or
fear
since
glan
had
befriended
them
most
of
them
were
chattering
and
waving
their
hands
toward
the
gate
but
some
watched
the
children
with
narrowed
eyes
and
then
whispered
behind
their
hands
to
their
neighbours
while
others
stood
and
gazed
gloomily
at
them
in
silence
they
were
a
picturesque
race
of
people
these
citizens
of
the
possible
world
clothed
in
a
bewildering
variety
of
dresses
of
no
particular
style
apparently
each
person
dressed
in
whichever
style
took
his
or
her
fancy
or
which
was
best
suited
to
the
occupation
carried
on
by
that
person
and
this
after
all
is
the
only
sensible
way
to
dress
the
result
of
these
numerous
styles
and
colours
was
very
pleasing
to
the
eye
at
least
so
thought
jack
and
molly
as
they
gazed
round
at
the
animated
scene
before
them
illustration
the
huge
gate
swung
back
don
t
you
fret
said
a
woman
dressed
in
dark
blue
with
a
blue
cap
on
her
head
and
a
chain
of
dull
yellow
beads
round
her
neck
we
took
care
to
have
the
gate
washed
with
a
magic
lotion
and
the
pumpkin
can
not
touch
the
gate
at
the
other
end
of
the
we
have
to
keep
both
safely
locked
in
case
a
friend
of
the
pumpkin
s
were
to
get
in
and
open
the
gate
for
she
looked
straight
into
the
eyes
of
first
jack
and
then
then
she
smiled
by
this
time
glan
had
finished
locking
up
the
gate
and
was
handing
the
keys
back
to
the
large
gentleman
with
a
brown
beard
dressed
in
a
green
robin
hood
style
of
seemed
inclined
to
be
sulky
i
m
sorry
i
could
not
wait
for
your
permission
to
open
the
gate
they
heard
glan
say
the
matter
was
urgent
you
see
it
was
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
who
are
going
to
try
and
help
you
d
no
right
to
snatch
the
keys
out
of
my
hand
like
you
did
replied
the
sullenly
you
might
have
got
me
into
no
end
of
trouble
if
they
been
decoys
where
s
their
pass
anyway
glan
beckoned
to
jack
and
molly
if
you
wouldn
t
mind
giving
up
your
passes
to
this
gentleman
he
said
ah
that
s
right
as
jack
and
molly
handed
their
envelopes
to
the
who
proceeded
to
open
them
and
examine
the
contents
carefully
then
he
slowly
nodded
his
head
all
right
this
time
he
said
but
you
be
careful
in
future
young
man
he
looked
at
glan
it
might
have
been
a
very
serious
glan
s
eyes
began
to
twinkle
i
will
certainly
profit
by
your
advice
he
said
i
m
extremely
sorry
i
had
to
snatch
the
keys
i
apologize
most
humbly
but
of
course
you
didn
t
understand
who
it
was
outside
and
what
danger
they
were
in
and
anyway
all
s
well
now
isn
t
it
sir
oh
it
s
all
right
this
time
as
i
said
thanks
said
glan
well
and
now
he
turned
to
the
two
children
you
must
be
very
very
tired
after
all
that
will
you
come
along
with
me
to
my
little
place
father
and
aunt
janet
will
be
very
pleased
to
welcome
jack
and
molly
assented
willingly
and
followed
glan
closely
as
he
made
his
way
through
the
crowd
when
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
knot
of
people
molly
began
to
thank
glan
for
coming
to
their
aid
at
the
gate
but
he
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
what
else
could
i
do
on
my
life
little
lady
he
said
i
have
faith
in
you
both
and
the
help
you
are
going
to
give
us
i
want
you
to
come
and
have
a
good
rest
now
and
then
in
the
morning
you
will
be
told
what
part
of
the
country
to
search
and
you
can
start
out
at
once
on
your
it
seems
as
if
we
have
already
started
observed
jack
it
seems
as
if
its
been
all
adventures
i
think
you
re
right
said
glan
but
there
s
more
to
we
ll
talk
about
those
you
must
be
too
tired
i
am
very
glad
you
got
here
all
right
i
was
delayed
in
coming
to
meet
felt
sure
somehow
that
you
d
decide
to
stay
after
you
had
heard
old
nancy
s
story
and
anyway
i
should
have
been
down
the
hill
to
meet
you
only
so
many
people
stopped
me
to
know
if
the
bad
news
was
the
pumpkin
had
there
were
such
a
lot
of
things
to
see
to
and
i
had
to
run
home
to
tell
aunt
janet
to
get
things
ready
for
case
you
came
back
with
me
so
that
i
reached
the
gate
just
in
time
to
let
you
he
stopped
a
little
out
of
breath
they
had
been
walking
fairly
quickly
all
this
time
and
the
children
could
now
see
more
clearly
what
a
beautiful
city
they
had
entered
everything
glistened
a
pure
white
in
the
moonlight
houses
walls
roofs
chimneys
front
doors
gates
pavements
were
white
and
spotlessly
clean
yet
the
curious
part
of
it
all
was
that
it
was
not
monotonous
to
the
eye
instead
it
seemed
to
make
a
fine
background
for
the
coloured
flowers
and
trees
and
dresses
of
the
people
and
the
city
was
full
of
soft
shadows
cast
by
the
objects
that
stood
in
the
light
of
the
moon
glan
and
the
two
children
turned
into
a
narrow
hilly
street
down
the
centre
of
which
ran
a
sparkling
brooklet
that
babbled
and
gurgled
as
it
splashed
over
its
pebbly
bed
most
of
the
houses
in
this
street
were
quaintly
built
with
the
top
part
bulging
out
over
the
street
and
molly
noticed
as
they
passed
that
all
the
windows
had
coloured
one
house
all
the
curtains
were
blue
in
another
a
deep
amber
shade
in
another
a
glowing
crimson
and
so
had
a
very
pretty
effect
especially
if
the
windows
were
lit
from
within
the
white
houses
the
coloured
curtains
and
the
full
of
flowers
that
adorned
each
window
in
the
street
made
a
great
impression
on
the
children
they
thought
it
all
charming
and
said
so
to
glan
the
possible
world
he
said
then
shook
his
head
and
held
up
his
finger
the
tolling
of
the
bell
floated
across
to
them
i
suppose
that
s
to
warn
people
isn
t
it
said
jack
glan
nodded
but
we
ll
soon
change
its
tune
won
t
we
he
said
it
s
that
ll
be
ringing
next
because
the
black
leaf
is
found
and
who
will
have
found
it
ah
ha
he
winked
knowingly
and
wagged
a
fat
forefinger
at
the
two
children
what
a
great
day
it
will
be
he
chuckled
you
ll
have
to
be
careful
i
don
t
win
because
i
m
going
to
search
too
you
know
but
we
ll
talk
all
about
that
in
the
at
the
top
of
the
hilly
street
they
crossed
an
open
square
with
a
market
cross
in
the
centre
and
entered
another
narrow
street
with
bulging
houses
and
shops
in
it
they
met
few
people
now
as
they
continued
on
their
way
many
were
still
down
by
the
west
gate
and
others
had
wended
their
ways
homeward
after
assuring
themselves
that
the
pumpkin
was
safely
outside
the
city
walls
about
up
the
street
glan
came
to
a
halt
outside
a
small
shuttered
shop
that
lay
back
underneath
the
frowning
brow
of
the
bulging
upper
story
of
the
building
like
a
dark
eye
producing
a
key
from
the
pocket
of
his
white
jacket
glan
placed
it
in
the
lock
of
the
side
door
and
opened
it
quietly
i
ll
go
in
first
shall
i
he
said
there
s
no
light
in
the
passage
and
you
might
fall
over
jack
and
molly
followed
him
into
the
house
and
stood
hesitating
on
the
mat
while
he
strode
down
the
passage
and
opened
a
door
at
the
farther
end
a
dim
light
crept
out
and
thinned
the
darkness
from
the
room
came
a
low
murmur
in
familiar
tones
come
along
called
glan
would
you
mind
just
shutting
the
front
door
thanks
very
it
was
a
small
room
at
the
end
of
the
passage
with
a
round
table
in
the
centre
of
it
on
which
stood
a
shaded
lamp
at
the
table
sat
glan
s
father
with
his
elbows
resting
on
a
large
open
book
in
front
of
him
while
his
hands
held
to
the
sides
of
his
head
covered
his
ears
an
expression
of
profound
melancholy
was
on
his
face
as
he
gazed
at
the
children
on
their
entrance
bending
over
the
fireplace
was
a
genial
elderly
woman
who
was
stirring
something
in
a
saucepan
bless
their
hearts
how
tired
they
look
she
exclaimed
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
children
s
faces
it
s
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
that
i
told
you

of
hot

no
time
for

re
sure

be
tired
said
glan
they
were
chased
up
the
hill
by
the
pumpkin
he
added
in
a
lower
voice
but
his
father
had
heard
what
was
that
he
asked
mournfully
taking
his
hands
down
from
his
ears
so
glan
had
to
explain
to
him
the
incident
at
the
gate
and
how
the
pumpkin
nearly
got
in
the
old
man
listened
intently
groaning
every
time
glan
paused
for
breath
and
rolling
his
eyes
whenever
the
pumpkin
was
mentioned
by
name
at
the
end
of
the
story
he
hastily
stopped
his
ears
again
and
bent
over
his
book
muttering
faintly
that
he
couldn
t
abide
that
bell
poor
old
father
said
glan
compassionately
it
does
upset
him
jack
and
molly
were
glad
of
the
hot
broth
and
aunt
janet
as
she
fussed
about
them
anxiously
was
pleased
to
see
that
the
steaming
bowls
were
soon
emptied
sleep
well
for
there
is
hard
work
before
you
but
everything
will
be
well
said
glan
beaming
down
at
them
as
he
wished
them
while
his
father
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
sighed
as
he
gave
them
each
a
limp
hand
aunt
janet
lit
two
long
candles
and
conducted
them
up
a
flight
of
high
narrow
stairs
to
the
top
of
the
house
where
there
were
two
small
rooms
with
little
white
beds
and
freshly
laundered
window
curtains

said

janet
puts
on
her
best
a
sunbeam
creeping
through
the
window
and
along
the
floor
to
molly
s
pillow
awoke
her
in
the
morning
she
sat
up
with
a
start
puzzled
for
a
moment
at
the
unfamiliar
surroundings
then
she
giving
a
long
sigh
snuggled
down
again
for
a
few
more
minutes
while
she
thought
things
over
how
strange
it
all
seemed
just
like
some
wonderful
dream
she
yet
it
was
not
a
dream
here
were
she
and
jack
in
the
middle
of
a
real
exciting
adventure
an
adventure
in
which
they
were
taking
an
important
and
she
hoped
useful
part
what
would
be
the
result
of
their
search
for
the
black
leaf
would
either
of
them
find
it
and
what
had
old
nancy
meant
by
saying
that
she
thought
only
of
them
would
be
successful
wouldn
t
she
and
jack
be
allowed
to
search
together
molly
wondered
she
hoped
jack
wouldn
t
be
sent
to
one
part
of
the
country
and
she
to
another
she
tried
to
recall
all
the
information
and
warnings
that
had
been
given
to
them
about
the
pumpkin
and
the
more
she
recalled
the
more
difficult
the
task
in
front
of
them
appeared
to
be
molly
stretched
out
her
arm
and
fumbled
about
in
the
clothes
that
lay
on
a
chair
by
the
bedside
she
presently
drew
forth
the
box
of
matches
old
nancy
s
gift
and
proceeded
to
examine
this
attentively
it
being
her
first
opportunity
of
doing
so
just
an
ordinary
box
of
least
so
it
there
was
no
maker
s
name
on
the
outside
simply
a
dark
blue
wrapper
there
were
a
dozen
matches
counted
i
wonder
if
jack
has
got
the
same
number
she
thought
then
hearing
a
distant
clock
strike
seven
she
put
the
match
box
back
in
her
satchel
and
sprang
out
of
bed
while
she
was
dressing
she
noticed
that
the
bell
which
had
been
tolling
solemnly
when
she
fell
asleep
was
now
silent
when
molly
was
ready
to
go
downstairs
she
climbed
on
a
chair
and
looked
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
below
which
was
already
alive
with
people
moving
to
and
fro
on
their
early
morning
business
everything
looked
so
clean
and
fresh
and
the
sun
was
shining
and
a
breeze
greeted
molly
so
warm
and
sweetly
scented
that
all
the
little
doubts
and
fears
that
had
crowded
in
on
her
trying
to
cloud
her
naturally
sunny
outlook
were
suddenly
swept
clean
away
and
molly
felt
that
everything
was
possible
and
good
on
such
a
perfect
morning
she
jumped
lightly
to
the
ground
and
ran
across
the
room
humming
a
patch
of
sunshine
lay
on
the
floor
by
the
door
and
as
molly
stopped
for
a
second
to
do
up
her
shoelace
she
saw
a
curious
shadow
form
on
the
patch
and
the
shadow
was
shaped
like
a
pumpkin
startled
she
looked
hastily
over
her
shoulder
but
there
was
nothing
there
and
even
as
she
looked
again
at
the
sunlit
patch
the
shadow
passed
away
why
it
must
have
been
only
a
cloud
passing
before
the
sun
she
told
herself
relieved
how
silly
of
but
nevertheless
she
felt
suddenly
depressed
she
did
not
hum
any
more
and
she
walked
slowly
downstairs
instead
of
running
with
her
usual
quick
step
in
passing
jack
s
room
the
door
of
which
stood
wide
open
she
saw
that
the
room
was
empty
so
jack
had
raced
her
and
was
already
downstairs
yes
he
s
been
up
this
last
and
he
s
out
in
the
back
garden
now
aunt
janet
informed
her
did
you
sleep
well
dearie
run
out
and
tell
your
brother
breakfast
ll
be
ready
in
three
minutes
will
you
dearie
and
aunt
janet
bustled
about
between
the
pantry
and
the
fireplace
and
the
breakfast
table
in
the
little
back
room
a
very
tempting
breakfast
table
it
looked
too
set
for
five
and
everything
so
spick
and
span
from
the
crisp
brown
rolls
to
the
long
glass
vase
filled
with
yellow
flowers
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
white
cloth
so
molly
went
in
search
of
jack
through
the
open
back
door
into
the
garden
the
garden
which
was
long
and
narrow
was
full
of
bushes
and
flowers
and
little
winding
paths
at
the
farthest
end
stood
six
tall
elm
trees
in
a
row
and
it
was
here
that
molly
spied
jack
and
glan
s
father
standing
talking
earnestly
together
hullo
molly
called
jack
when
he
saw
her
come
and
look
molly
made
her
way
down
the
garden
and
saw
that
jack
and
the
old
man
were
both
gazing
down
at
something
at
the
foot
of
one
of
the
trees
it
was
a
dark
red
filled
with
dry
soil
was
just
telling
do
you
think
molly
said
jack
excitedly
the
black
leaf
came
up
in
this
one
year
oh
molly
gasped
and
gazed
at
the
pot
with
awe
such
an
ordinary
it
looked
with
nothing
at
all
about
it
to
suggest
that
it
had
ever
been
connected
with
any
magic
of
course
missie
glan
s
father
explained
mournfully
it
was
no
use
me
it
that
year
you
see
because
there
was
no
pumpkin
to
pick
it
for
besides
he
added
bitterly
it
on
y
came
up
for
spite
that
s
spite
i
call
to
taunt
me
as
it
were
i
couldn
t
bide
the
sight
of
as
the
pumpkin
was
out
of
what
would
have
happened
if
you
picked
it
asked
jack
nothing
would
have
happened
at
the
end
of
the
thirteen
days
it
would
have
withered
away
and
the
plant
might
not
have
come
up
again
i
don
t
know
about
that
still
if
it
hadn
t
what
should
we
have
done
this
year
when
we
do
want
it
eh
yes
said
molly
it
is
a
good
job
you
didn
t
pick
it
because
supposing
it
didn
t
come
up
suppose
there
would
have
been
no
hope
of
getting
rid
of
the
pumpkin
this
time
unless
old
nancy
had
discovered
another
spell
suggested
jack
the
old
man
shook
his
head
dismally
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
beard
no
he
said
i
had
a
my
we
should
need
the
black
leaf
some
day
i
always
said
the
pumpkin
would
return
world
and
then
those
dreams
i
oh
why
didn
t
the
leaf
come
up
in
your
this
year
sighed
molly
things
never
happen
like
that
mumbled
glan
s
father
they
do
sometimes
said
molly
but
the
old
man
only
shook
his
head
there
s
aunt
janet
calling
us
to
breakfast
said
molly
i
was
sent
out
to
fetch
you
come
along
and
she
led
the
way
back
indoors
again
followed
by
the
other
two
now
what
have
you
been
doing
in
the
garden
cried
aunt
janet
catching
sight
of
the
three
serious
faces
looking
at
that
old
again
i
ll
be
bound
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
she
said
shaking
her
head
at
glan
s
father
brooding
over
that
miserable
old
breakfast
and
on
such
a
lovely
morning
too
if
i
had
my
way
i
d
smash
the
ugly
old
thing
up
and
have
done
with
really
i
believe
you
enjoy
it
disregarded
the
old
man
s
reproachful
glance
and
clapped
some
plates
on
the
table
a
little
impatiently
what
good
does
it
do
brooding
over
things
that
are
past
and
gone
and
can
t
be
helped
it
s
the
future
we
can
help
and
it
s
the
future
we
should
give
our
thought
to
and
make
it
better
than
the
past
glan
glan
where
s
glan
call
glan
somebody
he
s
in
the
shop
but
glan
had
heard
and
appeared
at
that
moment
through
the
door
that
led
from
the
parlour
to
the
shop
all
he
cried
beaming
and
rubbing
his
hands
together
what
a
perfect
morning
to
be
sure
and
did
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
rest
well
after
the
strenuous
time
they
had
yesterday
very
well
thank
you
said
molly
slept
like
a
top
said
jack
ah
that
s
right
said
glan
taking
his
place
at
the
table
round
which
the
others
were
already
seated
and
what
is
this
our
good
aunt
has
provided
scrambled
eggs
excellent
excellent
indeed
what
a
perfect
morning
who
could
feel
sad
at
heart
on
a
day
like
this
he
seemed
in
great
spirits
and
started
to
hum
as
he
helped
himself
to
salt
while
his
father
rolled
his
eyes
up
leaving
only
the
whites
visible
to
signify
his
despair
at
the
incurable
cheerfulness
of
his
son
come
come
now
and
how
is
father
this
morning
glan
continued
pushing
his
father
s
chair
closer
to
the
table
and
tucking
a
serviette
under
his
fathers
chin
for
all
the
world
as
if
he
were
a
baby
in
a
high
chair
he
s
been
at
that
old
again
said
aunt
janet
bad
wicked
man
smiled
glan
wagging
his
spoon
at
his
father
who
received
all
glan
s
bantering
remarks
with
the
same
stolid
expression
and
without
the
flicker
of
a
smile
jack
marvelled
at
glan
s
perseverance
with
his
father
when
his
attempts
to
cheer
him
up
were
always
without
success
he
began
to
doubt
whether
the
old
man
smile
and
tried
to
imagine
him
doing
failed
after
breakfast
said
glan
if
he
is
very
good
and
promises
not
to
pick
the
currants
out
of
the
buns
father
shall
mind
the
shop
while
the
little
lady
and
her
brother
and
aunt
janet
and
yours
faithfully
put
on
their
best
bonnets
with
the
bead
trimmings
and
their
boots
and
brown
cotton
gloves
gave
an
elaborate
wink
at
aunt
and
sally
forth
to
learn
what
plans
are
afoot
and
to
find
out
what
portion
of
the
country
we
are
each
to
will
jack
and
i
be
allowed
to
go
together
asked
molly
anxiously
certainly
if
you
wish
said
glan
of
course
we
d
rather
wouldn
t
we
moll
said
jack
and
she
assented
quickly
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
now
they
would
probably
both
fail
together
when
breakfast
was
finished
and
while
aunt
janet
went
to
put
on
her
bonnet
and
boots
and
brown
cotton
gloves
glan
showed
the
two
children
over
the
shop
it
contained
a
most
tempting
array
of
sugared
cakes
and
buns
and
pastries
and
of
which
glan
told
them
he
made
himself
in
the
bakehouse
at
the
side
of
the
shop
the
shop
was
sweet
and
clean
like
the
rest
of
the
house
and
the
sight
of
glan
in
his
white
cap
and
overall
standing
behind
the
counter
and
beaming
cheerfully
around
him
was
a
sight
to
lighten
the
heart
of
glan
s
father
it
s
fortunate
that
your
father
can
look
after
the
place
while
you
are
out
remarked
molly
but
i
thought
you
said
he
was
taken
back
and
given
a
place
at
court
didn
t
you
i
thought
that
was
why
he
wore
a
velvet
robe
and
quite
right
said
glan
but
it
is
only
a
very
unimportant
position
you
see
he
s
getting
only
has
to
turn
up
at
court
every
tuesday
and
friday
it
keeps
him
amused
on
his
free
days
he
does
all
sorts
of
things
to
fill
up
his
time
ah
here
he
comes
he
continued
as
his
father
shuffled
into
the
shop
now
be
very
careful
father
and
look
after
everything
nicely
while
we
re
away
won
t
you
and
d
better
wear
this
or
you
ll
spoil
that
lovely
velvet
and
glan
whipped
off
his
white
apron
and
made
his
father
put
it
on
this
over
his
gorgeous
velvet
robe
gave
him
a
comical
appearance
which
was
by
no
means
lessened
by
the
melancholy
expression
on
his
face
glan
gave
a
chuckle
with
arms
akimbo
he
surveyed
his
father
with
his
head
on
one
side
then
he
chuckled
again
such
an
irresistible
infectious
chuckle
it
was
that
jack
and
molly
despite
their
efforts
not
to
started
to
laugh
glan
went
on
chuckling
and
laughing
and
once
having
started
the
three
of
them
continued
laughing
and
could
not
stop
until
the
tears
came
into
their
eyes
and
jack
had
a
stitch
in
his
side
and
aunt
janet
appeared
all
ready
to
start
to
see
what
all
the
noise
was
about
poor
old
father
it
s
too
bad
to
laugh
but
really
really
and
glan
dried
his
eyes
on
the
sleeve
of
his
white
overall
and
started
to
laugh
again
but
glan
s
father
could
see
nothing
to
laugh
at
and
had
continued
dusting
the
scales
slowly
and
methodically
all
the
time
these
jam
puffs
are
two
a
penny
aren
t
they
he
asked
quite
unconscious
of
the
figure
he
presented
does
your
father
ever
laugh
jack
asked
as
soon
as
they
were
outside
the
shop
never
to
my
knowledge
said
aunt
janet
and
i
ve
kept
house
for
him
these
twenty
i
ve
seen
him
far
as
i
can
remember
replied
glan
but
that
was
a
long
time
ago
perhaps
he
ll
one
of
these
we
find
the
black
leaf
they
made
their
way
down
the
street
and
into
the
market
square
which
presented
a
very
different
appearance
in
the
daylight
from
the
sleepy
peaceful
look
it
had
worn
last
night
in
the
moonlight
now
it
was
awake
and
all
was
bustle
and
hurry
with
shops
open
and
people
passing
to
and
fro
where
did
you
say
we
were
going
first
asked
jack
i
didn
t
say
said
glan
but
i
should
think
you
might
guess
by
aunt
janet
s
bonnet
that
it
s
somewhere
very
we
re
going
to
the
palace
dearies
aunt
janet
broke
in
to
the
palace
exclaimed
the
children
and
shall
we
see
the
king
molly
added
of
course
said
glan
at
this
moment
their
attention
was
attracted
by
the
sound
of
people
running
and
shouting
and
they
saw
that
a
big
crowd
was
rapidly
gathering
round
the
market
cross
what
is
it
what
s
the
matter
people
near
by
were
asking
each
other
and
unable
to
get
information
they
would
rush
off
and
join
the
jostling
excited
mob
in
order
to
find
out
for
themselves
wait
here
a
moment
said
glan
and
i
ll
go
and
see
don
t
follow
me
or
we
shall
lose
each
other
in
the
crowd
i
won
t
be
and
leaving
the
children
and
aunt
janet
standing
outside
a
quaint
little
he
dashed
forward
and
was
quickly
lost
to
sight
in
the
surging
mass
of
people
that
were
rushing
onward
to
the
market
cross
everyone
was
simmering
with
excitement
and
jack
and
molly
had
great
difficulty
in
obeying
glan
s
instructions
to
wait
outside
for
him
there
especially
whenever
a
shout
or
groan
of
sympathy
or
indignation
rose
above
the
murmuring
of
the
crowd
and
told
them
that
something
unusual
was
taking
place
but
they
waited
and
in
a
few
minutes
they
saw
glan
making
his
way
back
through
the
outskirts
of
the
crowd
he
hurried
toward
them
his
face
unusually
grave
come
along
he
said
taking
each
of
the
children
by
an
arm
and
hastening
them
away
before
they
could
ask
any
questions
and
he
signed
to
aunt
janet
who
followed
behind
them
as
quickly
as
possible
don
t
look
back
it
s
no
use
we
can
t
do
anything
to
help
it
s
one
of
the
pumpkin
s
victims
some
poor
fellow
caught
by
him
outside
the
city
what
has
he
done
to
him
jack
managed
to
gasp
out
made
both
his
arms
disappear
and
covered
his
face
with
a
horrible
grey
stain
the
man
looks
awful
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
see
can
do
nothing
to
help
except
one
thing

leaf

the
only
thing
said
glan
chapter
ix
the
they
turned
out
of
the
square
into
a
wide
avenue
bordered
on
each
side
with
beautiful
trees
at
the
end
of
this
avenue
stood
the
palace
gates
and
behind
these
glimpses
could
be
caught
of
the
palace
itself
gleaming
white
through
the
trees
and
bushes
which
surrounded
it
and
almost
hid
it
from
sight
of
the
gates
the
only
parts
which
were
entirely
visible
were
its
four
white
towers
which
rose
high
above
the
tree
tops
having
ascended
the
flight
of
wide
marble
steps
before
the
gates
the
four
visitors
passed
the
seemed
to
know
glan
quite
made
their
way
through
the
grounds
to
the
main
entrance
of
the
palace
jack
and
molly
were
lost
in
admiration
of
the
beauty
of
the
scene
before
them
the
walls
and
white
towers
of
the
palace
stood
in
grounds
through
which
a
little
river
wandered
sparkling
in
the
sunlight
along
the
central
avenue
that
led
to
the
palace
and
up
the
great
wide
steps
to
the
main
door
there
moved
a
constant
stream
of
people
dressed
in
all
sorts
of
lovely
shades
and
colours
from
a
distance
you
might
almost
think
they
were
the
moving
reflections
of
the
flowers
that
clustered
in
profusion
wherever
your
eyes
turned
had
this
been
really
so
glan
in
his
white
suit
might
have
passed
for
the
reflection
of
a
white
stock
perhaps
molly
for
a
blue
and
white
periwinkle
jack
for
a
dark
blue
hyacinth
and
aunt
janet
who
was
all
in
brown
for
a
large
autumn
leaf
they
joined
the
moving
procession
and
as
they
began
to
mount
the
steps
glan
explained
to
the
children
that
all
these
people
were
on
the
same
errand
as
themselves
they
had
come
to
offer
their
help
in
the
organized
search
that
was
about
to
take
place
the
main
doors
of
the
palace
were
soon
reached
and
they
passed
through
and
were
presently
ushered
into
a
spacious
hall
panelled
with
dark
oak
for
although
the
outsides
of
the
buildings
in
the
city
were
white
the
children
had
already
noted
that
the
insides
were
coloured
in
many
and
varied
styles
the
hall
was
already
crowded
with
people
and
on
a
raised
daïs
at
the
far
end
there
sat
the
king
s
group
of
wise
and
learned
men
and
a
long
table
at
first
jack
and
molly
could
not
see
very
well
but
when
a
sudden
hush
fell
on
the
assembly
and
the
people
all
bowed
the
children
could
see
over
the
bowed
heads
that
some
one
of
importance
was
entering
they
were
made
sure
of
this
by
the
nudges
of
aunt
janet
and
looking
up
they
saw
it
was
the
king
his
majesty
was
and
rather
tall
and
well
built
and
had
a
strong
face
the
children
liked
his
appearance
that
he
was
every
inch
a
king
could
truly
be
said
of
him
though
he
wore
no
crown
or
velvet
robes
as
the
kings
usually
did
in
the
children
s
at
home
but
was
dressed
very
simply
in
a
suit
that
reminded
jack
vaguely
of
an
admiral
s
uniform
what
a
decent
sort
he
looks
whispered
jack
to
molly
after
a
few
words
of
welcome
to
the
people
the
king
called
upon
one
of
the
shrewd
little
man
with
tufty
white
tell
the
true
story
of
the
pumpkin
s
return
to
the
possible
world
which
the
councillor
did
having
obtained
a
full
account
from
old
nancy
the
only
question
which
still
remained
unsolved
was
who
was
the
traitor
who
had
drugged
old
nancy
and
so
aided
the
pumpkin
to
return
this
mystery
he
said
they
hoped
to
clear
up
when
the
black
leaf
was
found
when
he
had
finished
his
story
and
had
sat
down
a
buzz
of
murmuring
voices
filled
the
hall
and
people
turned
to
one
another
commenting
on
the
story
about
old
nancy
which
they
had
just
been
told
and
comparing
notes
on
the
exaggerated
versions
of
the
tale
that
had
reached
them
from
various
quarters
silence
fell
as
the
king
rose
again
after
a
few
comments
on
the
pumpkin
s
return
he
began
to
speak
of
the
plans
for
searching
which
he
and
the
councillors
had
discussed
at
an
emergency
meeting
early
this
morning
to
make
sure
that
every
likely
inch
of
ground
is
searched
he
said
we
have
taken
a
map
of
the
city
and
the
outlying
country
as
far
as
the
boundaries
of
this
kingdom
this
is
the
only
kingdom
in
which
the
black
leaf
can
grow
we
have
divided
this
map
into
a
number
of
small
squares
now
what
we
want
you
each
to
do
is
to
choose
a
square
of
the
map
which
you
may
take
away
with
search
thoroughly
every
inch
of
the
ground
marked
in
this
way
the
black
leaf
must
be
found
sooner
or
there
is
any
careless
searching
or
delay
in
searching
for
remember
we
have
only
days
before
the
black
leaf
if
it
is
not
found
before
then
the
pumpkin
will
remain
with
us
for
a
year
until
the
leaf
appears
again
and
another
search
can
be
made
those
who
volunteer
outside
the
city
are
advised
to
search
in
couples
as
the
pumpkin
will
be
a
constant
source
of
danger
to
a
person
alone
whereas
if
there
are
two
of
you
one
can
always
keep
watch
while
the
other
searches
difficult
places
or
rests
for
a
and
here
the
king
said
a
special
word
of
warning
regarding
decoys
and
traps
set
by
the
pumpkin
in
order
to
hinder
the
searchers
and
then
went
on
to
explain
what
should
be
done
if
the
black
leaf
was
found
repeating
the
words
that
jack
and
molly
had
already
heard
from
old
nancy
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
the
black
leaf
is
found
the
king
continued
signals
will
be
given
throughout
the
country
so
that
all
the
searchers
can
cease
and
make
their
way
back
to
the
city
and
the
hill
by
old
nancy
s
cottage
in
order
to
witness
the
pumpkin
s
punishment
these
signals
will
be
given
by
means
of
beacon
fires
which
will
be
lit
on
the
hill
tops
near
and
far
and
when
the
glad
news
reaches
the
city
all
the
bells
will
be
set
your
majesty
would
it
be
possible
for
one
of
the
pumpkin
s
friends
to
start
the
first
beacon
blazing
before
the
leaf
was
found
in
order
to
stop
the
searchers
some
one
in
the
hall
inquired
no
replied
the
king
because
we
are
so
arranging
it
that
only
the
person
who
has
actually
plucked
the
black
leaf
and
has
it
in
his
or
her
hand
can
set
a
light
to
the
first
beacon
each
beacon
is
being
specially
guarded
well
i
will
admit
that
we
have
called
in
the
aid
of
old
nancy
to
help
us
in
the
guarding
of
them
so
you
may
rest
assured
that
none
of
the
pumpkin
s
friends
will
be
able
to
touch
the
beacons
so
whoever
finds
the
black
leaf
remember
to
set
the
nearest
beacon
on
fire
before
starting
back
to
old
nancy
that
we
may
all
know
the
good
news
at
the
earliest
possible
the
king
concluded
by
asking
for
volunteers
to
search
outside
the
city
and
inside
the
city
to
come
forward
and
sign
their
names
in
the
book
which
had
been
placed
on
a
table
along
the
hall
the
pumpkin
has
already
in
the
last
few
hours
caused
much
sorrow
he
said
sadly
let
us
make
certain
that
this
is
the
last
time
he
shall
ever
bring
disaster
and
misery
to
our
country
let
us
put
our
best
efforts
into
this
scheme
for
finding
the
black
leaf
and
so
banish
for
all
time
the
grey
he
sat
down
amid
a
great
cheer
which
came
from
the
hearts
of
the
people
in
the
crowded
hall
it
was
obvious
that
the
king
was
very
popular
the
people
pressed
forward
eagerly
to
sign
their
names
and
jack
and
molly
together
with
glan
and
aunt
janet
were
among
the
foremost
to
signify
their
willingness
to
help
both
the
children
caught
the
wave
of
enthusiasm
which
swept
through
the
hall
and
felt
that
here
was
a
country
and
a
king
well
worth
working
for
and
their
dislike
of
the
pumpkin
who
would
spoil
everything
grew
more
intense
i
m
afraid
i
can
only
volunteer
to
search
inside
the
city
said
aunt
janet
to
the
children
as
they
turned
away
from
the
table
i
can
t
walk
very
far
without
getting
a
bit
tired
and
as
for
couldn
if
fifty
pumpkins
were
after
i
think
it
s
jolly
sporty
of
you
to
offer
at
all
said
jack
oh
we
all
want
to
do
what
we
can
dearie
she
smiled
the
four
of
them
moved
on
and
joined
a
group
of
people
who
were
examining
one
of
the
large
maps
of
the
city
and
surrounding
country
which
were
hanging
round
the
room
they
had
begun
to
discuss
what
part
of
the
country
would
be
the
best
for
them
to
search
when
they
heard
much
to
their
surprise
someone
call
out
the
names
of
the
two
children
in
a
loud
voice
turning
quickly
they
saw
that
the
king
had
the
big
book
of
names
in
front
of
him
and
with
his
finger
to
a
name
on
the
page
was
looking
round
the
room
it
was
one
of
the
councillors
near
him
who
had
called
out
their
names
evidently
at
the
king
s
request
before
the
children
could
wonder
what
they
ought
to
do
the
king
spoke
i
see
he
said
that
we
have
two
friends
from
the
impossible
world
who
have
kindly
offered
to
help
us
i
should
like
to
thank
them
personally
strangers
are
often
lucky
some
one
started
a
cheer
which
was
quickly
taken
up
by
the
entire
hall
full
of
people
and
jack
and
molly
both
blushing
furiously
at
this
unexpected
attention
were
pushed
forward
by
glan
and
aunt
janet
to
the
foot
of
the
raised
daïs
where
the
king
greeted
them
welcoming
them
to
the
country
and
warmly
shaking
hands
with
them
they
chatted
together
for
a
few
minutes
the
king
asking
many
questions
about
the
impossible
world
but
ah
me
the
king
said
i
am
afraid
this
will
be
the
impossible
world
now
that
the
pumpkin
s
we
will
soon
make
it
possible
again
your
majesty
said
molly
if
it
is
in
our
power
to
do
i
m
sure
we
shall
all
do
our
best
said
the
king
now
which
part
of
the
country
would
you
prefer
to
search
the
children
said
they
did
not
mind
as
all
the
country
was
strange
and
fresh
to
them
and
asked
his
majesty
if
he
thought
the
leaf
was
more
likely
to
be
outside
the
city
than
inside
of
course
one
can
never
be
sure
but
i
think
it
s
much
more
likely
to
be
outside
the
city
than
inside
the
king
replied
but
still
it
be
inside
we
shall
make
a
thorough
search
inside
naturally
in
every
garden
and
street
and
and
in
every
place
likely
and
when
the
children
heard
that
the
leaf
was
more
likely
to
be
outside
they
at
once
made
up
their
minds
outside
the
city
walls
they
would
search
jack
and
molly
together
and
so
it
was
arranged
they
chose
a
little
square
of
the
country
that
lay
outside
the
east
gate
of
the
city
it
was
entirely
fresh
country
to
them
and
molly
liked
the
names
given
to
that
part
of
the
country
down
the
three
green
lanes
over
goblin
s
heath
through
the
orange
wood
and
the
country
along
the
banks
of
a
broad
river
to
lake
desolate
and
the
brown
hills
although
these
names
were
all
marked
in
one
little
square
on
the
map
it
was
really
a
good
many
when
every
likely
part
must
be
carefully
gone
over
and
examined
after
jack
and
molly
had
received
their
small
square
of
map
glan
stepped
forward
to
pick
his
square
he
shook
hands
and
chatted
with
the
king
for
a
second
and
then
stood
before
the
map
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
while
he
was
deciding
tracing
along
the
map
with
his
plump
white
forefinger
the
children
stood
aside
watching
the
stream
of
people
passing
to
and
fro
choosing
their
square
of
map
shaking
hands
with
the
king
and
passing
on
and
out
of
the
great
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
most
of
them
had
a
friendly
smile
and
nod
for
jack
and
molly
as
they
went
by
and
several
came
up
to
the
children
and
shook
hands
with
them
thanking
them
for
offering
to
help
their
country
in
this
trouble
at
length
after
glan
had
chosen
and
helped
aunt
janet
to
choose
her
bit
and
shaken
hands
excitedly
with
everybody
round
about
including
aunt
janet
by
mistake
he
aunt
janet
jack
and
molly
bade
farewell
to
the
king
and
made
their
way
out
of
the
palace
they
retraced
their
steps
through
the
palace
grounds
passing
the
sentry
at
the
gate
and
went
toward
the
market
square
again
glan
and
aunt
janet
insisted
on
showing
the
children
the
way
to
the
east
gate
and
so
the
four
went
along
talking
eagerly
the
children
full
of
enthusiasm
for
the
coming
search
for
the
king
and
for
the
possible
world
i
ve
got
a
big
forest
to
search
in
my
bit
said
glan
i
like
forests
and
i
m
arranging
for
father
to
help
me
if
he
feels
the
days
when
he
s
not
at
court
i
wish
i
could
have
got
a
bit
to
search
outside
the
east
as
to
be
near
you
all
the
bits
i
wanted
were
already
taken
by
other
people
fortunately
though
i
ve
managed
to
get
a
square
that
backs
on
to
a
piece
of
the
ground
you
ll
be
i
start
from
the
west
gate
you
see
the
wood
bends
round
at
this
and
he
compared
his
square
of
map
with
jack
and
molly
s
square
and
showed
them
where
his
ground
touched
theirs
so
i
shan
t
be
so
very
far
away
he
laughed
you
can
t
get
rid
of
me
i
m
sure
we
don
t
want
to
said
molly
rather
not
said
jack
oh
glan

will
be
careful
won
t
you
not
get
caught
by
the
pumpkin
added
molly
anxiously
of
course
little
lady
glan
replied
you
should
see
me
if
i
want
to
i
ll
not
get
he
was
still
studying
and
comparing
the
maps
why
look
here
he
exclaimed

got
the
orange
wood
in
your
bit
well
i
never
d
you

that
aunt
janet
the
orange
wood

relative

in
that
wood
i
must
give
you
his
glan
scribbled
something
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
handed
it
to
the
children
any
of
the
people
in
the
village
near
by

direct
you
to
his

he

be
delighted
to

aunt
janet
and
father
and
me
but
don
t
be
surprised
at
his
funny
little
s
a
queer
old
very
queer
old
glan
chuckled
to
himself
at
some
recollection
he
s
a
kind
of
cousin
of
glan
s
father
dearies
observed
aunt
janet
the
children
were
glad
to
hear
of
this
one
person
at
any
rate
whom
they
might
trust
in
the
strange
unknown
country
before
them
be
sure
to
humour
him
though
added
glan
he
s
worth
it
don
t
while
they
had
been
talking
they
had
been
passing
through
many
quaint
streets
on
their
way
to
the
east
gate
streets
that
on
an
ordinary
occasion
would
have
made
jack
and
molly
long
to
stop
and
explore
them
slowly
there
were
so
many
tempting
and
curious
things
to
be
seen
but
there
was
no
time
for
loitering
now
there
was
serious
work
to
be
done
so
they
hastened
along
until
at
length
the
east
gate
was
reached
here
glan
produced
two
neat
little
boxes
of
sandwiches
and
cakes
giving
one
of
them
to
jack
and
one
to
molly
a
snack
for
lunch
he
said
you
re
sure
to
find
plenty
of
friends
as
you
go
along
said
aunt
janet
but
do
take
care
of
yourselves
dearies
good
luck
be
with
and
she
fumbled
for
her
and
dabbed
her
eyes
rapidly
while
glan
patted
her
on
the
shoulder
here
s
to
our
next
meeting
he
cried
cheerily
and
may
it
be
soon
who
s
going
to
light
the
first
beacon
little
lady
you
or
i
neither
said
jack
laughing
i
that
s
the
sort
cried
glan
patting
aunt
janet
vigorously
as
he
beamed
at
jack
the
keeper
of
the
east
gate
had
by
this
time
appeared
and
was
cautiously
opening
the
gate
finding
the
way
clear
he
opened
it
wide
laugh
at
misfortune
glan
shouted
gaily
as
jack
and
molly
passed
out
on
to
the
high
road
keep
up
a
good
heart
shall
win
good
luck
good
luck
they
saw
him
wave
his
white
cap
in
the
air
there
was
a
flutter
of
hands
then
the
gate
closed
chapter
x
one
meets
jack
and
molly
in
the
third
green
they
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
along
the
broad
white
road
which
led
to
the
three
green
lanes
according
to
the
map
when
they
heard
the
east
gate
of
the
city
open
and
shut
again
with
a
clang
and
looking
back
jack
and
molly
saw
that
two
people
had
come
out
and
had
started
off
in
the
opposite
direction
to
that
in
which
they
were
going
two
more
searchers
said
jack
i
remember
that
little
man
with
the
green
coat
don
t
you
molly
he
was
at
the
very
twinkling
oh
yes
i
saw
him
said
molly
and
that
boy
with
him
in
that
curious
suit
i
wonder
which
part
they
are
searching
supposing
are
the
lucky
people
who
are
going
to
find
the
black
leaf
if
we
only
knew
sighed
the
little
girl
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
white
road
and
gazing
pensively
at
the
two
figures
in
the
distance
i
know
one
thing
said
jack
we
shan
t
be
the
lucky
people
if
we
don
t
move
along
come
on
two
minutes
brisk
walking
brought
them
to
the
entrance
to
the
first
green
lane
and
here
their
search
began
the
lane
was
a
very
twisty
one
and
was
closed
in
on
either
side
with
high
thick
hedges
fresh
and
green
the
hedges
were
and
starred
with
tiny
white
flowers
that
smelled
very
sweet
how
strange
that
it
isn
t
autumn
here
like
it
was
at
home
said
jack
it
s
more
like
summer
here
isn
t
it
molly
it
isn
t
really
strange
said
molly
everything
is
so
different
here
isn
t
it
i
don
t
see
why
the
seasons
in
the
possible
world
should
be
like
ours
any
more
than
anything
else
is
like
no
p
r
aps
you
re
right
agreed
jack
they
went
carefully
along
searching
thoroughly
as
they
went
molly
taking
the
side
of
the
lane
and
jack
the
right
for
the
most
part
it
was
fairly
easy
work
there
were
not
many
places
in
the
first
green
lane
where
the
black
leaf
could
grow
undetected
though
from
time
to
time
an
extra
thick
and
bush
would
necessitate
a
halt
for
a
thoroughly
satisfactory
examination
there
is
one
thing
that
seems
strange
to
me
molly
went
on
presently
and
that
is
the
way
the
ordinary
and
the
magic
things
seem
to
all
get
mixed
up
together
i
m
sure
i
shall
be
forgetting
when
we
get
home
again
and
keep
expecting
spells
and
magic
things
to
so
shall
i
said
jack
and
then
as
molly
began
to
what
s
the
matter
he
asked
oh
jack
she
laughed
what
would
aunt
phœbe
say
if
she
could
see
us
now
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
the
world
s
coming
to
mimicked
jack
in
an
aunt
phœbe
voice
and
then
joined
in
molly
s
laughter
and
the
best
of
it
is
he
chuckled
it
s
all
through
her
giving
you
that
birthday
present
she
be
i
suppose
we
really
ought
not
to
laugh
at
her
laughed
molly
it
s
hardly
somehow
i
can
t
just
help
they
continued
to
search
chatting
and
laughing
in
a
excited
mood
and
soon
they
had
covered
the
best
part
of
the
first
green
lane
as
they
neared
the
break
in
the
hedge
on
jack
s
side
blocked
by
a
white
gate
revealed
a
big
field
which
lay
behind
the
hedge
hullo
said
jack
have
we
got
to
search
this
field
too
i
wonder
where
s
the
map
molly
had
it
in
her
pocket
and
produced
it
at
once
leaning
against
the
gate
the
two
children
studied
it
carefully
yes
see
here
it
is
marked
here
said
molly
the
hedge
on
the
side
i
was
the
boundary
but
the
field
this
side
is
marked
in
our
i
tell
you
what
then
suggested
jack
i
ll
start
on
the
field
while
you
finish
to
the
end
of
the
s
only
a
few
yards
more
then
you
come
back
and
start
the
other
end
of
the
molly
agreed
so
they
separated
for
a
few
minutes
and
continued
the
search
but
there
was
no
sign
of
the
black
leaf
anywhere
in
the
big
field
or
in
the
first
green
lane
and
at
length
they
started
on
the
second
green
lane
the
second
green
lane
had
low
hedges
and
many
ferns
and
wild
flowers
growing
by
the
way
and
a
ditch
running
along
one
side
of
it
which
made
the
searching
a
little
more
difficult
there
were
also
several
gates
leading
from
this
lane
into
fields
which
had
to
be
searched
too
some
of
the
fields
where
the
grass
was
long
took
a
good
time
to
do
properly
but
the
two
children
stuck
to
it
perseveringly
urged
on
by
the
hope
that
perhaps
just
round
the
corner
or
behind
the
next
tree
or
even
perhaps
a
few
feet
ahead
of
them
among
the
long
grass
grew
that
which
they
black
leaf
but
so
far
they
had
searched
in
vain
in
the
early
afternoon
they
found
themselves
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
green
lane
and
here
they
decided
to
stop
and
have
a
short
rest
and
some
lunch
when
they
sat
down
on
the
soft
grass
by
the
side
of
the
lane
they
suddenly
discovered
that
they
were
really
tired
and
when
they
saw
the
tempting
little
sandwiches
and
cakes
in
the
snack
for
lunch
packets
glan
had
given
them
they
realized
that
they
were
really
hungry
they
had
been
too
busy
and
excited
to
realize
these
things
before
over
lunch
they
got
out
the
map
again
and
studied
it
what
a
lonely
piece
of
country
this
seems
jack
remarked
do
you
know
we
haven
t
seen
a
single
person
since
we
started
searching
nor
a
single
house
said
molly
it
s
a
good
thing
we
have
this
map
with
us
how
useful
it
is
let
me
look
jack
are
there
any
houses
or
villages
marked
near
here
because
we
shall
have
to
find
some
place
to
stay
if
there
seems
to
be
some
sort
of
village
marked
there
um
it
s
not
very
near
though
said
jack
it
s
the
other
side
of
the
goblin
s
heath
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
a
house
of
any
sort
marked
between
here
and
that
village
does
there
still
i
daresay
we
could
reach
the
village
before
dusk
if
we
are
not
delayed
at
and
if
the
heath
isn
t
too
if
it
is
and
we
can
t
find
a
cottage
before
the
end
of
the
heath
we
ll
climb
up
a
tree
moll
it
ll
be
great
sport
and
we
shall
be
quite
safe
there
till
they
packed
up
the
remains
of
the
lunch
for
it
was
a
very
generous
snack
that
glan
had
put
in
for
each
of
them
and
after
resting
a
few
minutes
longer
they
rose
to
their
feet
and
prepared
to
start
on
again
my
word
i
am
thirsty
said
jack
at
molly
s
advice
he
tried
one
of
the
little
sweet
things
in
old
nancy
s
packet
and
though
it
was
certainly
refreshing
jack
still
craved
for
a
drink
of
water
is
there
a
stream
of
water
marked
anywhere
near
here
give
me
the
map
again
they
were
standing
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
green
lane
with
the
map
in
their
hands
when
the
sound
of
some
one
singing
came
to
them
from
a
distance
jack
and
molly
looked
at
each
other
this
was
the
first
human
sound
they
had
heard
since
they
left
the
high
road
perhaps
this
person
whoever
it
was
could
tell
them
where
they
could
get
some
water
the
singer
was
evidently
approaching
as
the
song
grew
louder
and
clearer
from
the
direction
of
the
lane
which
they
were
just
about
to
search
then
just
as
they
expected
the
singer
to
come
round
the
corner
of
the
singing
ceased
no
one
appeared
jack
and
molly
waited
a
while
then
started
off
down
the
lane
in
the
direction
whence
the
singing
had
come
thinking
perhaps
that
the
singer
had
stopped
to
rest
round
the
corner
of
the
lane
they
were
right
as
they
turned
the
corner
they
saw
someone
sitting
under
a
tree
at
the
side
of
the
lane
it
was
a
young
girl
a
little
older
than
jack
and
a
pretty
girl
with
eyes
and
a
straight
white
nose
and
deep
golden
hair
that
curled
about
her
shoulders
her
soft
green
frock
matched
the
colour
of
her
eyes
she
did
not
notice
jack
and
molly
at
first
as
her
attention
was
taken
up
by
the
contents
of
a
small
wicker
basket
in
her
lap
she
was
peering
inside
it
anxiously
and
counting
aloud
eight
nine
ten
they
heard
her
say
eleven
oh
dear
i
ve
lost
no
here
it
is
twelve
oh
that
s
right
she
looked
up
and
saw
the
children
she
gazed
up
at
them
then
smiled
such
a
friendly
sweet
smile
molly
thought
oh
i
i
didn
t
hear
you
come
along
she
said
we
heard
you
singing
said
molly
the
girl
blushed
i
didn
t
know
anyone
was
near
she
said
i
often
sing
when
i
m
by
s
so
lonely
as
a
she
fastened
the
lid
of
her
basket
down
we
were
awfully
glad
to
hear
you
said
jack
because
do
you
know
we
haven
t
met
a
soul
since
we
left
the
east
have
you
come
from
the
city
then
asked
the
girl
with
much
interest
rising
to
her
feet
oh
you
can
t
imagine
how
lonely
it
is
to
live
out
here
what
news
is
there
what
does
the
city
look
like
now
oh
i
d
give
anything
to
live
in
the
city
with
crowds
of
people
and
lights
and
shops
real
haven
t
you
got
any
pavement
then
in
the
village
where
you
live
asked
jack
i
don
t
live
in
a
village
answered
the
girl
its
right
out
here
in
all
this
lonely
part
that
mother
and
i
near
here
asked
molly
yes
just
at
the
end
of
the
third
green
lane
said
the
girl
in
a
house
inquired
jack
yes
why
not
the
girl
smiled
what
did
you
think
we
d
live
in
i
meant
said
jack
it
s
not
marked
on
our
map
there
s
no
house
marked
until
you
get
to
the
other
side
of
the
goblin
s
heath
and
i
didn
t
think
there
was
one
so
the
girl
began
to
laugh
well
there
is
one
even
if
it
isn
t
marked
on
your
map
they
don
t
mark
all
the
houses
you
know
if
your
way
takes
you
along
down
this
lane
you
ll
pass
the
house
and
mother
would
be
awfully
pleased
to
see
you
if
you
could
spare
a
little
while
she
rarely
gets
news
of
the
city
or
sees
we
going
along
this
way
said
jack
and
we
were
just
wondering
if
there
was
anywhere
we
could
get
a
drink
of
water
because
we
re
both
so
thirsty
thirsty
said
the
girl
why
here
is
the
very
thing
and
she
opened
her
basket
and
took
out
a
beautiful
bunch
of
grapes
i
had
been
sent
out
to
gather
these
from
our
bunches
i
ve
gathered
do
have
she
placed
a
bunch
in
jack
s
hands
oh
i
say
can
you
spare
them
though
protested
jack
and
wouldn
t
your
mother
mind
she
d
mind
if
i
didn
t
give
you
a
bunch
when
you
were
so
thirsty
said
the
girl
and
insisted
on
molly
having
a
bunch
too
well
it
really
is
awfully
kind
of
you
said
jack
and
molly
thanked
her
also
molly
hesitated
just
a
second
before
eating
her
grapes
wondering
if
they
were
doing
right
in
accepting
them
from
the
little
girl
whose
name
even
they
didn
t
know
but
a
glance
at
the
little
girl
s
sweet
frank
face
reassured
any
doubts
molly
may
have
had
jack
had
already
started
his
bunch
so
molly
ate
her
grapes
too
you
know
said
jack
i
don
t
think
i
ve
ever
tasted
such
jolly
fine
grapes
i
was
terribly
thirsty
after
searching
all
the
searching
asked
the
girl
puzzled
did
you
say
searching
what
have
you
lost
it
isn
t
what
we
ve
s
what
we
can
t
find
said
jack
you
s
what
they
re
all
looking
the
girl
shook
her
head
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
she
said
don
t
you
know
about
the
search
for
the
black
leaf
asked
jack
in
surprise
oh
i
say
and
about
the
pumpkin
being
back
course
you
know
that
what
screamed
the
girl
the
pumpkin
back
no
no
i
didn
t
know
that
we
hear
out
here
alone
but
oh
dear
oh
dear
whatever
are
we
going
to
do
she
was
trembling
and
seemed
very
upset
i
must
get
home
at
once
and
tell
mother
she
added
she
fastened
the
lid
of
her
basket
with
shaking
fingers
are
you
coming
along
this
way
now
illustration
do
have
one
the
children
explained
to
her
that
although
they
were
coming
that
way
they
would
have
to
search
as
they
came
and
advised
her
to
go
on
in
front
of
them
to
tell
her
mother
if
she
felt
this
was
the
wisest
thing
to
do
but
she
seemed
afraid
to
leave
them
i
d
rather
stay
with
you
if
you
don
t
mind
she
said
expect
you
ll
think
i
m
an
awful
i
simply
daren
t
go
on
alone
i
ll
help
you
search
as
we
go
along
and
do
tell
me
how
it
all
the
pumpkin
came
so
as
the
three
of
them
moved
off
down
the
lane
jack
and
molly
recounted
something
of
what
had
happened
they
did
not
talk
much
about
themselves
but
related
the
main
incidents
of
the
pumpkin
s
return
their
companion
listened
eagerly
putting
in
a
hurried
question
every
now
and
then
when
they
had
finished
she
said
well
i
do
think
it
s
plucky
of
you
to
search
like
a
strange
land
feel
quite
ashamed
of
myself
for
being
so
scared
just
now
we
all
have
to
take
our
chance
do
let
me
help
you
search
this
bit
of
lane
and
afterward
i
ll
go
to
the
city
and
ask
to
be
given
a
part
to
search
too
how
far
do
you
intend
to
search
we
thought
of
trying
to
get
as
far
as
the
other
side
of
the
goblin
s
heath
said
jack
oh
you
ll
never
be
able
to
do
that
before
nightfall
the
girl
exclaimed
it
s
a
very
big
heath
i
you
care
to
stay
at
our
house
mother
and
i
would
be
only
too
proud
to
have
you
if
you
d
care
it
s
very
good
of
you
said
molly
well
wait
until
you
see
mother
if
you
d
prefer
that
said
the
girl
wait
until
you
see
our
house
i
know
i
shouldn
t
care
to
promise
to
stay
with
anyone
until
i
d
seen
where
they
lived
in
a
strange
country
she
had
added
this
seeing
that
jack
and
molly
hesitated
but
they
were
more
than
because
she
spoke
so
reasonably
and
frankly
they
continued
to
search
the
third
green
lane
thoroughly
the
afternoon
wore
on
and
the
shadows
of
eventide
began
to
fall
presently
the
girl
said
we
are
near
the
end
of
the
lane
now
round
the
next
turning
you
will
see
my
so
far
the
search
had
been
in
vain
and
jack
and
molly
were
beginning
to
feel
very
tired
as
the
lane
had
been
long
and
difficult
we
must
have
been
two
hours
searching
this
lane
said
molly
will
your
mother
be
getting
anxious
about
you
the
girl
shook
her
head
and
she
won
t
even
be
cross
when
she
sees
that
i
ve
brought
visitors
home
with
me
you
will
come
in
won
t
you
she
asked
and
we
can
all
have
tea
it
sounded
so
tempting
that
the
children
accepted
gladly
especially
as
the
house
hove
in
sight
at
that
moment
turning
the
corner
they
came
suddenly
upon
it
such
a
quaint
cosy
little
house
which
lay
snuggled
away
behind
a
cluster
of
thick
bushes
and
trees
the
lane
continued
for
only
a
short
distance
beyond
the
house
then
it
opened
out
into
a
great
wide
goblin
s
heath
the
children
hadn
t
time
to
take
in
much
of
the
scenery
as
their
companion
ushered
them
into
the
garden
of
her
house
quickly
it
was
darker
in
the
garden
under
the
trees
than
out
in
the
roadway
and
they
saw
that
a
little
light
was
glimmering
from
one
of
the
windows
of
the
house
which
made
it
look
very
homely
and
comfortable
jack
and
molly
followed
their
companion
up
the
path
to
the
front
door
the
girl
tapped
twice
on
the
front
door
then
rattling
the
handle
and
calling
out
here
we
are
mother
she
threw
open
the
door
and
the
three
of
them
passed
in
they
found
themselves
in
a
dark
narrow
passage
at
the
end
of
which
they
could
see
a
glow
as
from
firelight
their
companion
closed
the
front
door
and
led
the
way
along
the
passage
here
we
are
mother
she
called
again
and
a
figure
appeared
in
the
firelit
opening
at
the
end
of
the
passage
and
stood
there
chuckling
softly
suddenly
jack
and
molly
were
afraid
jack
i
m
going
back
gasped
molly
and
turning
both
the
children
made
for
the
door
but
it
was
shut
fast
and
there
were
no
handles
or
bolts
to
be
found
the
girl
and
the
figure
in
the
firelight
burst
into
loud
laughter
you
little
sillies
a
voice
cried
accompanied
by
another
burst
of
laughter
they
could
see
the
girl
in
green
quite
plainly
now
she
had
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
and
stood
whispering
to
the
other
person
the
firelight
shone
on
both
of
them
the
girl
in
green
was
strangely
altered
no
longer
fresh
and
young
and
face
looked
old
and
hard
and
scornful
jack
and
molly
caught
a
few
of
the
words
she
was
whispering
oh
jack
molly
sobbed
they
re
the
pumpkin
s
friends
we
re
trapped
chapter
xi
jack
and
molly
clutched
hold
of
each
other
tightly
while
a
feeling
of
despair
rushed
over
them
how
foolish
how
very
foolish
they
had
been
to
trust
the
girl
what
awful
thing
could
be
going
to
happen
to
them
now
they
wondered
the
whispered
conversation
between
the
two
at
the
end
of
the
passage
ended
in
a
loud
burst
of
laughter
and
giggling
then
the
girl
turned
toward
them
and
beckoned
come
on
she
said
and
the
quicker
the
better
it
will
be
for
you
no
nonsense
now
as
the
children
did
not
move
how
dare
you
jack
managed
to
say
open
this
door
and
let
us
out
at
once
mean
sneak
his
voice
was
shaky
but
very
determined
oh
don
t
be
silly
said
the
girl
you
ve
to
obey
you
might
just
as
well
you
d
like
me
to
fetch
you
both
heh
heh
laughed
the
figure
behind
her
i
d
like
to
see
you
fetch
i
would
the
laughter
and
the
nameless
threat
underlying
the
words
gave
the
children
a
creepy
sensation
all
up
and
down
their
spines
oh
let
s
go
before
she
us
cried
molly
and
went
forward
dragging
jack
by
the
hand
that
s
sense
said
the
girl
and
made
room
for
them
to
pass
out
of
the
passage
into
the
firelight
they
found
themselves
in
a
round
room
which
was
lit
up
by
the
dancing
flames
of
a
log
fire
afterward
jack
and
molly
could
not
remember
seeing
any
furniture
in
the
but
the
fire
and
a
fireplace
they
could
not
recall
seeing
any
windows
but
they
remembered
the
floor
which
was
made
of
cobbles
because
it
was
hard
to
walk
on
the
room
appeared
to
have
no
ceiling
or
else
a
very
high
one
at
any
rate
no
ceiling
was
visible
overhead
all
was
drifting
smoke
and
black
gloom
like
the
entrance
to
a
railway
tunnel
let
s
have
a
look
at
the
pretty
dears
said
the
figure
beside
the
girl
moving
forward
and
jack
and
molly
stood
face
to
face
with
the
ugliest
old
woman
they
had
ever
seen
in
fact
had
ever
even
imagined
her
face
was
a
mass
of
deep
wrinkles
her
narrow
sunken
eyes
looked
like
two
restless
black
beads
darting
from
side
to
side
as
if
to
escape
from
the
two
slits
of
eyelids
which
imprisoned
them
her
nose
and
chin
curved
towards
each
other
after
the
fashion
of
and
her
otherwise
toothless
mouth
had
one
long
yellow
fang
always
visible
a
bright
crimson
scarf
was
wound
round
her
head
like
a
turban
from
which
long
wisps
of
jet
black
hair
escaped
and
hung
about
her
face
as
the
children
looked
at
her
she
did
a
terrifying
thing
which
they
quickly
discovered
was
a
constant
habit
of
hers
the
old
woman
s
restless
beady
eyes
became
suddenly
still
and
she
fixed
upon
the
children
in
turn
a
piercing
stare
gradually
opening
her
eyes
wider
and
wider
and
wider
until
they
became
two
big
round
black
balls
encircled
by
saucers
of
staring
still
eyes
then
suddenly
the
lids
snapped
over
them
and
they
were
once
more
little
darting
black
beads
heh
heh
heh
laughed
the
old
woman
what
a
surprise
for
yer
duckies
wasn
t
it
now
and
she
thrust
her
face
close
to
the
children
and
leered
unpleasantly
stoopid
little
baggages
she
added
far
for
better
you
d
stopped
at
in
what
don
t
concern
you
but
we
ll
soon
learn
you
to
come
she
turned
to
the
girl
behind
her
all
right
she
said
in
an
undertone
i
d
know
em
again
i
ve
had
a
good
look
when
s
coming
in
about
an
hour
i
expect
answered
the
girl
then
she
dropped
her
voice
and
started
whispering
again
the
two
children
gazed
into
each
other
s
frightened
white
faces
and
a
little
sob
escaped
from
molly
eh
said
the
old
woman
what
you
say
ducky
nothing
all
right
come
along
then
my
pretties
come
along
and
wait
in
the
drorin
his
excellency
the
grey
pumpkin
is
not
at
home
just
at
present
but
he
won
t
be
long
oh
dear
no
he
won
t
be
long
step
this
way
in
the
drorin
he
ll
be
to
see
yer
heh
heh
molly
glanced
despairingly
at
the
girl
in
green
the
girl
who
had
been
so
friendly
a
short
time
before
when
they
were
outside
in
the
lane
molly
held
out
her
hands
the
girl
only
laughed
oh
have
you
no
pity
cried
molly
do
let
us
go
he
ll
never
pumpkin
need
never
know
if
there
is
anything
we
can
do
for
you
i
m
sure
my
brother
and
i
will
be
only
too
pleased
would
you
even
give
up
the
go
straight
back
home
asked
the
girl
sharply
here
then
was
their
chance
of
escape
if
they
would
looked
at
jack
what
would
the
pumpkin
do
to
he
came
she
shuddered
then
she
thought
of
old
nancy
and
the
king
and
glan
and
she
knew
that
what
the
girl
asked
of
them
was
impossible
she
and
jack
exchanged
glances
again
they
had
decided
they
would
take
their
chance
would
you
promise
asked
the
girl
no
answered
jack
and
molly
together
hurry
up
and
push
them
in
then
the
girl
turned
away
dismissing
the
subject
immediately
the
old
woman
chuckling
to
herself
opened
a
door
in
the
wall
which
the
children
had
not
noticed
before
and
told
them
to
follow
her
to
the
drorin
unless
they
wanted
to
be
fetched
there
so
they
followed
her
it
was
pitch
dark
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
the
old
woman
called
out
to
the
girl
in
green
to
hold
a
light
for
them
which
she
did
standing
in
the
doorway
holding
a
flickering
taper
above
her
head
jack
and
molly
followed
the
old
woman
along
a
short
passage
down
a
flight
of
stone
steps
to
a
door
at
the
bottom
she
took
a
key
from
her
pocket
and
calling
to
the
girl
in
green
again
telling
her
to
hold
the
light
at
the
top
of
the
steps
she
fumbled
at
the
lock
opened
the
door
and
then
without
more
ado
she
pushed
jack
and
molly
inside
and
slammed
the
door
on
them
they
heard
her
lock
the
door
then
go
shuffling
up
the
steps
grumbling
to
herself
then
another
door
all
was
silent
jack
and
molly
were
in
absolute
darkness
and
could
not
see
an
inch
in
front
of
them
they
dared
not
move
but
stood
still
clinging
hold
of
each
other
oh
jack
why
we
trust
her
sobbed
molly
how
were
we
to
know
she
seemed
so
decent
the
sneak
said
jack
oh
can
t
we
anything
molly
it
was
dreadful
just
standing
in
the
they
talked
in
low
tones
to
each
other
for
a
while
wondering
how
long
it
would
be
before
the
pumpkin
arrived
neither
of
them
dared
to
speak
of
what
he
might
do
when
he
came
anything
happened
to
them
would
any
one
miss
them
and
come
in
search
of
and
then
molly
remembered
jack
she
cried
the
matches
old
nancy
s
matches
why
ever
didn
t
we
think
of
them
before
exclaimed
jack
now
was
the
time
to
use
them
undoubtedly
for
if
ever
there
was
a
dark
place
where
some
light
was
needed
jack
and
molly
were
fumbling
eagerly
in
their
satchels
be
careful
jack
said
molly
don
t
drop
any
have
you
got
yours
yet
i
have
now
i
ll
strike
see
what
jack
was
still
searching
his
satchel
for
his
box
of
matches
meanwhile
molly
took
a
match
out
of
her
box
and
struck
it
the
children
were
not
quite
sure
what
they
had
expected
to
happen
but
they
felt
vaguely
disappointed
to
see
just
an
ordinary
little
flare
of
light
spring
out
of
the
darkness
just
an
ordinary
little
flickering
match
anyway
they
could
now
see
what
sort
of
a
place
they
were
shut
up
in
it
was
a
kind
of
underground
cellar
small
and
square
and
high
roofed
and
except
for
a
few
old
boxes
in
one
corner
empty
the
walls
were
damp
and
mouldy
the
floor
broken
and
uneven
and
the
place
seemed
full
of
cobwebs
and
then
they
realized
that
it
was
not
quite
an
ordinary
match
it
burnt
longer
and
strange
to
say
the
rays
from
it
were
concentrating
all
in
one
a
long
thin
streak
of
jack
and
molly
quickly
sensed
this
but
what
was
the
light
pointing
at
the
flame
was
directed
straight
toward
the
boxes
in
the
corner
the
children
crossed
the
cellar
and
examined
the
boxes
they
looked
like
wooden
sugar
boxes
there
were
three
of
them
and
they
were
all
empty
jack
pulled
them
away
from
the
wall
but
there
was
nothing
behind
them
then
molly
s
match
went
out
here
i
ll
light
one
said
jack
i
ve
got
mine
so
jack
lit
one
just
the
usual
match
flare
at
first
but
as
soon
as
it
burned
up
the
light
gathered
together
all
on
one
side
of
the
match
as
it
were
a
long
streak
pointing
in
the
exactly
opposite
direction
to
where
the
boxes
were
right
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
cellar
for
a
moment
jack
doubted
wondering
whether
it
was
a
sort
of
joke
on
him
but
he
and
molly
followed
the
light
quickly
and
saw
that
it
was
concentrated
on
a
spot
high
up
on
the
wall
near
the
roof
look
quick
said
molly
there
s
an
iron
ring
or
handle
or
something
up
but
how
can
we
reach
it
began
jack
and
then
they
remembered
what
the
first
match
had
shown
them
and
hastily
dragging
the
boxes
across
the
floor
piled
them
one
on
top
of
the
other
underneath
the
ring
in
the
wall
then
jack
s
match
went
out
both
children
were
now
tremendously
excited
and
fearful
lest
the
pumpkin
should
come
before
they
had
finished
their
investigations
they
moved
as
rapidly
as
possible
molly
lit
the
next
match
while
jack
clambered
up
to
the
top
of
the
boxes
her
light
pointed
straight
at
the
iron
ring
it
s
a
ring
all
right
cried
jack
but
oh
moll
i
can
t
quite
reach
it
whatever
shall
we
do
as
the
match
pointed
steadily
at
the
ring
and
offered
no
further
suggestions
molly
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
boxes
too
jack
s
remark
was
only
too
true
the
ring
was
just
out
of
reach
try
as
they
would
to
touch
it
i
believe
i
could
reach
it
if
you
could
lift
me
up
jack
said
molly
said
jack
and
then
molly
s
match
went
out
as
it
would
be
too
difficult
to
hold
a
match
while
trying
to
reach
the
ring
and
as
molly
said
she
remembered
just
where
the
ring
was
on
the
wall
it
was
decided
to
pull
the
ring
if
possible
and
then
light
a
match
and
see
what
had
happened
so
jack
lifted
molly
up
and
after
groping
about
on
the
wall
with
her
hands
for
a
few
seconds
she
caught
hold
of
the
ring
i
ve
got
it
keep
steady
jack
she
cried
joyfully
and
gave
a
vigorous
tug
at
the
iron
ring
something
s
given
feels
as
if
a
sort
of
door
s
opened
all
right
put
me
down
now
jack
and
strike
a
jack
followed
her
directions
and
by
the
light
of
the
match
they
saw
that
a
small
square
door
had
opened
in
the
wall
above
their
heads
the
light
from
the
match
pointed
straight
through
the
opening
it
looked
like
a
narrow
dark
tunnel
beyond
jack
put
his
match
down
on
the
top
of
the
boxes
to
see
if
it
would
give
them
sufficient
light
from
there
but
directly
it
left
his
hand
it
went
out
so
they
decided
to
try
to
get
into
the
tunnel
before
they
lit
up
again
as
it
was
too
difficult
to
hold
matches
while
scrambling
through
the
little
black
opening
jack
hoisted
molly
up
first
and
she
managed
to
get
through
the
door
and
then
she
turned
and
reached
down
her
hand
to
pull
jack
up
it
was
rather
an
ordeal
doing
all
this
in
the
dark
but
at
length
it
was
safely
accomplished
and
they
were
both
inside
the
tunnel
once
through
the
door
although
rather
cramped
they
found
there
was
sufficient
room
to
stand
up
if
they
bent
their
heads
they
did
not
stop
to
close
the
door
behind
them
but
lighting
another
match
they
scurried
along
the
tunnel
as
fast
as
ever
they
could
the
tunnel
twisted
and
turned
a
good
deal
and
then
began
to
slope
gradually
upward
two
more
matches
they
were
obliged
to
light
before
they
came
at
length
to
a
standstill
where
the
tunnel
branched
out
in
two
directions
the
light
pointed
steadily
to
the
left
so
they
followed
it
another
minute
s
rapid
walking
and
they
felt
a
rush
of
cool
air
and
when
their
match
spluttered
and
went
out
they
could
see
that
the
inky
darkness
was
thinning
a
little
way
ahead
and
so
they
did
not
light
another
match
but
hastened
onward
toward
a
glimmer
of
light
in
the
distance
as
they
drew
nearer
they
saw
that
it
was
the
end
of
the
tunnel
and
led
out
into
the
open
air
jack
and
molly
moved
cautiously
when
they
came
to
the
end
they
crept
out
and
found
themselves
in
the
middle
of
a
thick
tangle
of
bushes
through
the
bushes
they
struggled
and
forced
a
way
until
they
at
length
came
out
on
to
a
narrow
footpath
which
threaded
its
way
in
and
out
of
a
host
of
bushes
and
trees
they
began
to
run
as
soon
as
they
were
on
the
footpath
though
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
or
where
it
would
lead
them
but
they
ran
and
continued
to
run
until
they
reached
a
wider
path
and
saw
that
they
were
on
a
big
open
heath
they
paused
to
regain
their
breath
and
take
their
bearings
it
was
but
the
moon
which
sailed
overhead
in
a
clear
sky
made
everything
almost
as
light
as
day
they
were
certainly
on
a
heath
of
some
sort
why
of
course
jack
gasped
very
much
out
of
breath
this
must
be
the
goblin
s
heath
chapter
xii
goblin
s
the
goblin
s
heath
with
its
little
crouching
bushes
and
hillocks
looked
very
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
here
and
there
a
tree
rising
up
from
the
low
bushes
around
it
stood
out
clearly
against
the
night
sky
toward
the
nearest
big
tree
jack
and
molly
made
their
way
it
was
a
giant
of
a
tree
with
great
gnarled
trunk
and
plenty
of
room
among
its
lower
branches
for
a
little
girl
and
boy
to
curl
up
and
rest
comfortably
and
safely
screened
by
its
thick
curtain
of
leaves
once
they
were
safely
hidden
in
the
tree
jack
and
molly
had
time
to
talk
matters
over
they
decided
to
stay
where
they
were
until
daylight
when
they
could
continue
their
search
they
talked
and
planned
for
some
time
and
then
as
their
excitement
wore
off
a
little
they
began
to
get
very
sleepy
everything
seemed
quiet
and
still
around
them
but
they
would
take
no
more
risks
that
night
so
decided
to
sleep
in
keeping
watch
and
waking
the
other
up
at
certain
intervals
or
if
anything
happened
in
the
meantime
they
had
no
idea
what
the
time
was
so
they
arranged
their
intervals
by
the
moon
when
the
moon
reached
a
certain
place
jack
who
undertook
the
first
watch
protesting
that
he
wasn
t
tired
was
to
wake
molly
up
so
molly
went
to
sleep
after
making
jack
promise
that
he
would
wake
her
up
if
she
showed
any
signs
of
falling
out
of
the
tree
jack
had
a
hard
struggle
to
keep
awake
at
first
but
he
managed
it
somehow
and
after
molly
had
woken
up
and
taken
a
turn
at
watching
and
he
had
had
a
short
sound
sleep
he
felt
much
refreshed
the
time
wore
on
and
jack
was
just
starting
his
second
watch
and
molly
had
fallen
asleep
again
when
he
heard
a
long
rustle
in
one
of
the
bushes
down
below
he
leant
forward
peering
down
through
the
branches
there
was
evidently
something
stirring
inside
the
bush
the
leaves
rustled
and
shook
and
then
were
thrust
aside
and
a
queer
little
figure
stepped
out
and
stood
on
the
broad
footpath
in
the
moonlight
it
was
a
very
small
quaint
man
dressed
in
brown
with
a
pointed
cap
on
his
head
he
gazed
along
the
pathway
for
a
moment
then
turned
and
scanned
the
heath
in
the
opposite
direction
jack
gave
a
start
as
something
moved
in
the
tree
beside
him
but
it
was
only
molly
awake
and
staring
down
at
the
little
brown
man
with
absorbed
attention
a
squeal
of
laughter
came
from
among
the
bushes
a
short
distance
away
and
the
next
second
another
little
man
came
running
over
the
grass
to
the
waiting
figure
and
started
talking
rapidly
their
voices
were
very
tiny
and
although
the
sounds
floated
clearly
up
to
the
listeners
in
the
tree
the
words
were
undistinguishable
while
they
watched
a
third
little
man
appeared
accompanied
by
two
quaint
little
women
dressed
in
brown
skirts
and
shawls
and
brown
bonnets
all
at
once
it
dawned
on
jack
and
molly
who
these
little
people
were
with
the
tiny
thin
dancing
legs
and
the
elfish
faces
they
were
goblins
and
of
course
the
heath
was
named
after
them
the
children
had
not
expected
to
see
any
goblins
on
the
heath
they
had
certainly
thought
it
a
picturesque
name
to
call
this
part
of
the
country
but
they
had
not
expected
any
reason
for
the
name
but
behold
here
before
their
eyes
were
real
live
goblins
the
first
goblins
they
had
ever
seen
and
they
watched
them
surprised
and
curious
more
goblins
now
began
to
appear
on
the
scene
one
after
another
they
came
darting
from
behind
bushes
sliding
down
the
trunks
of
trees
or
dropping
from
the
branches
racing
along
the
footpath
skipping
over
the
grass
until
by
and
by
it
seemed
as
if
there
were
tiny
brown
figures
scurrying
to
and
fro
on
every
side
appearing
and
disappearing
here
there
in
and
out
the
whole
heath
seemed
to
be
alive
with
goblins
such
a
squeaking
of
tiny
voices
a
chinking
of
goblin
laughter
and
a
pattering
of
feet
and
the
goblins
seemed
to
be
all
so
busy
and
important
and
in
a
feverish
haste
about
nothing
at
all
presently
the
children
noticed
that
one
of
the
goblins
had
made
his
way
to
the
foot
of
their
tree
and
was
very
busy
dragging
and
pushing
aside
a
big
stone
he
moved
it
away
at
length
and
disclosed
a
small
hole
in
the
tree
trunk
close
to
the
ground
he
bent
down
and
crawled
into
the
hole
a
scrambling
and
scratching
began
inside
the
tree
that
sounded
as
the
scrambling
noise
became
louder
and
nearer
as
if
the
goblin
were
climbing
up
to
the
top
of
the
trunk
oh
jack
i
believe
he
lives
in
this
tree
whispered
molly
what
shall
we
do
if
he
finds
us
up
here
you
see
they
were
not
quite
sure
whether
the
goblins
were
friends
or
enemies
or
how
they
would
be
disposed
to
regard
them
however
they
were
soon
to
know
for
a
few
seconds
later
the
scratching
and
scrambling
having
continued
until
it
sounded
close
underneath
where
the
children
were
crouching
the
goblin
popped
its
head
up
through
a
hole
just
beside
jack
s
right
foot
the
goblin
studied
the
sole
of
jacks
shoe
attentively
for
a
moment
then
his
gaze
travelled
to
jack
whom
he
eyed
with
mild
astonishment
then
he
caught
sight
of
molly
and
transferred
his
attention
to
her
the
children
remained
silent
not
knowing
what
to
say
they
could
tell
nothing
of
the
goblin
s
attitude
toward
them
from
his
surprised
face
then
he
spoke
his
voice
sounded
very
small
and
far
away
but
the
children
were
glad
to
find
that
they
could
understand
what
he
said
are
you
real
asked
the
goblin
of
course
we
are
said
jack
what
are
you
was
the
next
question
molly
started
to
explain
but
she
soon
noticed
that
the
goblin
was
shaking
his
head
so
she
stopped
no
there
isn
t
really
a
place
called
the
impossible
world
which
you
can
reach
through
a
tree
in
a
forest
he
said
as
if
confiding
to
them
a
sad
truth
it
s
only
a
molly
was
taken
aback
oh
but
there
such
a
place
she
affirmed
we
know
there
we
have
come
from
i
like
to
hear
you
say
i
don
t
believe
you
said
the
goblin
candidly
i
wish
i
could
and
i
wish
you
real
indeed
i
we
real
said
jack
warmly
we
re
as
real
as
anything
why
it
s
you
that
is
people
say
are
what
do
you
think
we
are
then
if
you
don
t
believe
we
are
real
people
asked
molly
quickly
giving
jack
a
warning
glance
well
you
may
be
only
an
optical
may
think
i
see
you
but
you
may
not
really
be
there
suggested
the
goblin
blandly
wagging
his
quaint
little
head
from
side
to
side
his
head
and
two
little
hands
clutching
the
edge
of
the
hole
were
still
the
only
parts
visible
of
him
the
children
gazed
down
at
him
an
optical
illusion
this
was
indeed
a
horrible
thought
and
made
molly
pinch
herself
to
make
sure
she
was
really
there
then
she
laughed
we
are
as
real
as
you
are
she
said
then
she
had
an
inspiration
as
real
as
old
nancy
she
added
watching
the
goblin
closely
his
expression
changed
immediately
and
a
look
of
glad
surprise
crossed
his
face
why
do
you
know
her
he
asked
quickly
rather
said
jack
she
s
a
friend
of
then
i
am
a
friend
of
yours
said
the
goblin
climbing
out
of
the
hole
and
standing
beside
the
children
whether
you
are
you
their
recent
lesson
in
trusting
people
had
made
the
children
more
cautious
and
although
they
could
see
that
they
had
no
choice
in
their
behaviour
toward
this
little
goblin
as
they
were
powerless
to
escape
from
the
heath
with
its
swarms
of
goblins
yet
they
felt
friendly
disposed
toward
him
for
his
own
sake
he
seemed
quite
genuine
in
his
regard
for
old
nancy
and
very
soon
he
was
sitting
in
the
tree
beside
them
chatting
away
and
asking
them
all
about
themselves
and
answering
questions
by
the
score
they
found
that
he
knew
that
the
pumpkin
had
returned
one
of
his
had
brought
the
news
and
they
discovered
also
that
the
goblins
were
the
pumpkin
s
bitter
enemies
then
they
told
him
all
about
their
search
for
the
black
leaf
and
how
they
were
to
search
the
heath
when
daylight
came
you
won
t
see
any
of
us
in
the
daytime
said
the
goblin
we
ll
be
all
asleep
down
our
little
holes
but
i
don
t
think
the
black
leaf
is
anywhere
on
the
heath
or
one
of
us
would
have
seen
it
and
the
news
would
have
soon
spread
amongst
still
i
suppose
we
shall
have
to
search
it
all
the
same
as
we
promised
said
molly
yes
you
re
quite
right
agreed
the
goblin
besides
we
not
have
seen
it
i
m
afraid
you
ll
find
the
heath
very
i
daresay
you
could
search
it
in
a
day
if
you
start
at
dawn
i
wish
i
could
help
you
one
thing
i
can
can
send
word
to
you
if
the
pumpkin
appears
anywhere
in
this
neighbourhood
while
you
are
searching
the
heath
that
is
very
kind
of
you
said
molly
it
will
help
us
a
and
when
you
come
to
the
village
you
want
to
know
of
some
one
you
can
to
miss
marigold
don
t
forget
the
name
said
the
goblin
miss
marigold
repeated
jack
i
ll
remember
thanks
very
do
you
know
smiled
the
goblin
when
i
heard
that
old
nancy
had
sent
the
pumpkin
to
the
impossible
world
i
thought
it
was
a
place
like
a
place
but
you
say
that
you
really
suppose
you
can
t
come
down
from
the
tree
and
let
the
other
goblins
see
you
the
children
were
about
to
reply
when
a
great
hubbub
and
excitement
arose
among
the
goblins
below
as
a
new
goblin
dashed
in
among
them
with
some
exciting
news
wait
here
said
the
goblin
and
i
ll
go
and
find
what
it
s
all
he
soon
climbed
down
and
appeared
among
the
crowd
of
eager
chattering
goblins
presently
he
slipped
away
again
and
scrambled
up
the
tree
to
the
children
i
m
glad
you
didn
t
come
down
he
said
they
are
searching
for
pumpkin
s
spies
are
an
old
woman
and
a
young
girl
some
of
the
goblins
saw
them
about
half
an
hour
ago
on
the
main
road
over
the
jack
and
molly
began
to
shiver
a
little
it
s
all
right
said
the
goblin
i
haven
t
told
the
goblins
where
you
are
i
thought
they
d
be
sure
to
want
to
see
you
and
this
of
course
would
attract
attention
but
i
told
them
to
go
and
have
some
sport
and
to
lead
the
old
hag
and
the
girl
a
real
dance
i
told
them
they
were
the
pumpkin
s
lead
them
a
dance
crackly
noises
in
the
bushes
to
lead
them
off
the
regular
goblins
dance
we
ll
lead
them
i
ll
go
too
and
tell
you
what
happens
i
ll
be
back
before
is
my
home
you
tree
for
the
present
and
he
dashed
away
the
children
saw
him
swoop
into
a
group
of
excited
goblins
and
urge
them
to
follow
they
did
and
presently
there
was
scarcely
a
goblin
in
sight
they
had
all
gone
trooping
away
to
the
place
on
the
heath
where
the
old
woman
and
the
girl
were
searching
for
jack
and
molly
it
seemed
to
the
children
that
they
waited
in
the
tree
for
hours
and
hours
waiting
listening
occasional
sounds
floated
to
them
from
the
distance
they
could
hear
squeaking
and
crackling
and
once
they
heard
a
shrill
scream
but
they
saw
nothing
until
the
dawn
broke
almost
immediately
afterward
the
goblin
returned
darting
from
out
of
the
bushes
opposite
popping
into
the
hole
in
the
tree
trunk
and
scrambling
up
to
them
in
the
pale
glimmer
of
the
morning
light
he
told
them
what
had
happened
and
how
they
had
twice
prevented
the
old
woman
from
turning
down
the
path
that
led
past
the
children
s
they
are
gone
from
the
heath
now
he
said
we
drove
them
home
in
the
end
by
darting
out
and
pinching
their
legs
and
throwing
prickly
leaves
at
them
there
were
thousands
of
us
goblins
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
us
when
they
found
we
were
really
in
earnest
and
meant
to
get
rid
of
them
and
were
not
just
soon
went
the
old
hag
tried
to
tread
on
some
of
was
so
angry
but
we
snatched
her
shoe
off
and
threw
it
into
a
it
s
very
kind
of
you
to
have
helped
us
so
said
molly
we
enjoyed
it
said
the
goblin
it
was
great
fun
and
they
really
deserved
it
you
and
now
that
it
was
daybreak
the
goblin
bade
to
the
children
remember
he
said
i
will
find
some
means
of
warning
you
throughout
the
day
if
the
pumpkin
is
he
popped
down
his
hole
they
heard
him
scramble
a
little
way
inside
the
all
was
quiet
jack
and
molly
looking
out
from
the
tree
saw
that
all
the
other
goblins
had
vanished
they
waited
a
while
until
the
day
came
then
they
climbed
down
from
their
stretched
themselves
and
at
once
set
about
their
search
it
was
a
difficult
task
and
a
long
one
for
there
seemed
countless
thick
bushes
trees
hillocks
and
winding
paths
on
the
goblin
s
heath
but
they
plodded
on
searching
eagerly
and
carefully
for
a
couple
of
hours
they
worked
then
as
the
morning
advanced
they
remembered
that
they
had
had
nothing
to
eat
since
yesterday
so
they
climbed
up
another
tree
so
as
not
to
be
taken
by
surprise
and
finished
up
the
remains
of
glan
s
snack
while
they
discussed
their
plans
for
the
their
map
so
as
not
to
leave
any
part
of
the
heath
unsearched
there
s
one
bit
i
m
afraid
we
must
go
back
and
do
said
molly
though
i
don
t
like
the
idea
of
going
near
there
again
you
remember
did
not
search
the
little
bit
of
lane
just
beyond
house
yesterday
that
bit
and
the
very
beginning
of
the
they
did
not
like
the
idea
of
going
back
to
the
third
green
lane
at
all
but
they
went
when
they
came
within
sight
of
the
lane
they
were
amazed
to
find
that
the
house
had
gone
it
had
vanished
completely
jack
and
molly
could
scarcely
believe
their
eyes
at
first
but
on
the
whole
they
were
distinctly
relieved
that
it
wasn
t
there
nevertheless
they
searched
the
end
of
the
lane
and
the
edge
of
the
heath
quickly
with
constant
watchful
eyes
on
the
place
where
the
house
had
been
having
satisfied
themselves
that
the
leaf
was
nowhere
about
there
they
proceeded
to
the
spot
where
they
had
left
off
searching
and
continued
peering
among
the
bushes
and
trees
and
heather
of
the
goblin
s
heath
hour
after
hour
passed
by
and
the
day
wore
on
still
they
plodded
away
at
their
task
keeping
together
and
listening
always
in
case
a
message
came
from
the
goblin
when
they
got
hungry
again
they
ate
some
of
old
nancy
s
little
brown
sweets
and
found
them
very
refreshing
in
the
daylight
they
could
hardly
imagine
it
was
the
same
heath
that
they
had
seen
by
moonlight
there
was
not
the
slightest
trace
of
goblins
or
spies
that
is
not
the
slightest
trace
until
they
came
across
a
pond
and
saw
half
out
of
the
water
and
stuck
in
the
soft
mud
a
shoe
a
curiously
shaped
shoe
which
they
remembered
vaguely
seeing
the
foot
of
the
old
woman
with
the
horrible
eyes
this
was
evidently
the
shoe
that
the
goblins
had
thrown
into
the
pond
the
sight
of
it
made
all
their
recent
adventures
return
vividly
to
their
minds
and
made
them
very
unwilling
to
be
still
on
the
heath
when
night
came
so
they
hastened
on
their
way
evening
was
already
approaching
when
they
finally
came
to
the
end
of
their
day
s
search
and
no
sign
of
the
black
leaf
had
they
found
as
no
warning
had
come
from
the
goblin
and
they
had
not
been
disturbed
in
any
way
they
felt
on
the
whole
all
the
better
for
their
day
on
the
sunny
heath
though
they
were
tired
now
and
not
at
all
sorry
to
turn
their
footsteps
toward
the
little
village
which
appeared
close
at
hand
at
the
edge
of
the
heath
chapter
xiii
gives
them
a
miss
marigold
was
in
the
garden
tying
up
the
sunflowers
as
jack
and
molly
passed
her
cottage
which
was
the
fourth
one
along
the
village
street
such
a
quaint
little
village
street
it
was
with
cobbled
stones
and
grass
growing
in
the
roadway
and
bunchy
white
cottages
with
thatched
roofs
the
children
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
lady
in
the
garden
of
course
and
were
just
wondering
where
miss
marigold
lived
when
they
saw
a
card
hanging
in
the
window
on
which
was
printed
miss
marigold
provided
they
stopped
miss
marigold
looked
up
from
her
flowers
and
saw
two
tired
little
faces
looking
at
her
over
the
gate
miss
marigold
was
tall
and
thin
and
looked
neither
old
nor
young
but
between
the
two
her
thick
hair
which
was
of
a
pale
yellow
colour
was
neatly
braided
round
her
head
she
was
dressed
in
a
dark
green
dress
with
collar
and
cuffs
she
looked
kind
when
she
smiled
and
as
she
smiled
when
she
saw
the
children
they
made
up
their
minds
to
stay
there
if
they
could
so
they
opened
the
gate
and
entered
her
garden
she
listened
while
they
told
her
who
they
were
and
what
they
wanted
i
shall
be
pleased
to
give
you
accommodation
she
said
in
her
gentle
stiff
little
manner
and
you
would
like
a
cup
of
hot
tea
and
some
toasted
muffins
at
once
i
m
jack
and
molly
felt
that
there
was
nothing
they
would
like
more
than
tea
and
muffins
but
they
told
miss
marigold
that
they
had
no
money
with
them
and
asked
her
what
they
could
do
for
her
to
earn
their
tea
bed
and
breakfast
nothing
at
all
you
are
searching
for
the
black
is
enough
you
will
have
done
more
for
me
and
for
the
whole
country
than
can
ever
be
repaid
if
you
find
it
said
miss
marigold
and
led
the
way
into
her
cottage
which
was
quaint
and
with
low
ceilings
and
sloping
floors
the
children
had
a
refreshing
wash
then
sat
down
to
a
tea
and
toasted
muffins
and
eggs
and
brown
bread
and
butter
and
honey
and
fresh
fruit
over
tea
they
told
miss
marigold
about
their
search
and
the
latest
doings
of
the
pumpkin
miss
marigold
had
never
actually
seen
the
pumpkin
but
she
had
heard
much
about
him
of
course
and
was
very
interested
in
the
children
s
account
we
have
only
just
received
news
in
the
village
here
that
the
pumpkin
has
returned
one
of
the
villagers
who
went
to
the
city
came
riding
back
over
the
goblin
s
heath
with
the
news
she
told
the
children
while
they
were
talking
they
heard
footsteps
on
the
garden
path
outside
the
window
and
then
came
a
tap
at
the
door
jack
and
molly
started
but
miss
marigold
rose
leisurely
saying
with
a
shake
of
her
head
i
told
him
not
to
stay
as
late
as
then
she
opened
the
door
ah
come
in
timothy
she
said
timothy
came
in
catching
sight
of
strangers
in
the
room
he
paused
hesitating
on
the
mat
nervously
twisting
his
cap
in
his
hands
timothy
was
a
fat
boy
about
twelve
years
old
with
puffy
cheeks
and
round
eyes
and
a
simple
expression
miss
marigold
introduced
him
as
her
nephew
much
to
the
children
s
surprise
as
he
was
utterly
unlike
his
aunt
in
every
looks
especially
except
for
the
hair
which
was
the
same
pale
yellow
colour
timothy
has
been
out
to
a
said
miss
marigold
to
the
children
haven
t
you
timothy
umth
lisped
timothy
in
a
thick
voice
nodding
his
head
i
hope
you
enjoyed
yourself
said
molly
politely
perapths
replied
timothy
sitting
down
on
the
extreme
edge
of
a
chair
molly
looked
puzzled
but
he
seemed
and
she
felt
sorry
for
him
as
he
appeared
to
be
so
nervous
what
kept
you
so
late
asked
his
aunt
you
ought
to
have
been
home
an
hour
know
i
don
t
like
you
being
out
after
timothy
blushed
and
began
a
jerky
stammering
sort
of
explanation
his
aunt
frowned
a
little
and
looked
at
him
suspiciously
you
haven
t
been
on
the
goblin
s
heath
have
you
miss
marigold
asked
no
ma
m
replied
timothy
promptly
where
have
you
come
from
he
asked
jack
suddenly
we
ve
just
come
from
the
goblin
s
heath
replied
jack
and
at
timothy
s
eager
request
to
be
told
about
their
adventures
jack
started
to
tell
him
about
their
search
timothy
appeared
to
listen
intently
until
presently
his
aunt
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
to
prepare
the
bedrooms
immediately
he
leant
across
the
table
and
interrupted
here
he
exclaimed
suddenly
jack
stopped
speaking
and
stared
at
timothy
who
was
obviously
in
a
very
excited
state
here
i
thay
what
do

thig
said
timothy
what
what
is
it
what
s
the
matter
asked
jack
i
theen
said
timothy
and
exploded
with
laughter
jack
and
molly
exchanged
bewildered
glances
while
timothy
rolled
and
rocked
in
his
chair
with
laughter
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
fat
white
cheeks
he
continued
to
gasp
and
laugh
until
molly
grew
quite
concerned
about
him
and
jumping
off
her
chair
she
ran
to
the
door
to
call
his
aunt
this
sobered
him
immediately
and
he
sprang
up
waving
his
hand
to
stop
her
don
t
don
t
he
managed
to
gasp
i
alwayth
laugh
when

when
i
exthited

when

seen
what
oh

said
molly
the
he
he
he
timothy
giggled
the
black
leaf
oh
cried
jack
and
molly
together
their
questions
tumbling
over
each
other
in
their
eagerness
where
is
it
where
did
you
see
it
did
you
pick
it
what
did
you

with
it
i
didn
t
pick

timothy
answered
but
i
know
where
it
ith
he
leant
toward
them
and
whispered
hoarsely
his
eyes
round
and
bulging
in
the
orange
timothy
went
on
to
tell
them
how
he
had
happened
to
see
it
it
seemed
that
he
had
been
forbidden
by
his
aunt
to
go
on
to
the
goblin
s
heath
or
into
the
orange
wood
because
it
was
rumoured
that
the
pumpkin
s
spies
were
in
hiding
in
both
these
was
even
said
by
some
that
the
pumpkin
himself
had
been
seen
on
the
heath
yesterday
although
timothy
didn
t
believe
this
he
said
he
longed
to
explore
both
the
wood
and
the
heath
and
he
had
deceived
his
aunt
pretending
he
was
going
to
tea
with
a
friend
and
instead
had
slipped
into
the
wood
which
lay
just
beyond
the
village
and
had
wandered
about
there
he
had
come
across
mr
papingay
s
house
in
the
he
had
often
heard
about
but
never
seen
before
mr
papingay
jack
and
molly
recognised
the
name
of
course
it
was
glan
s
relation
he
was
a
funny
old
man
was
mr
papingay
said
timothy
and
it
was
a
funny
house
and
the
black
leaf
was
growing
in
a
in
the
house
only
don
t
tell
his
aunt
he
d
been
in
the
wood
he
pleaded
she
would
be
angry
with
him
and
perhaps
send
him
away
home
to
his
father
and
he
didn
t
want
to
go
home
yet
wait
till
you
ve
got
the
it
won
t
matter
said
timothy
he
seemed
so
distressed
at
the
idea
of
his
aunt
knowing
of
his
disobedience
although
she
didn
t
seem
the
kind
of
aunt
to
be
too
severe
molly
thought
that
the
children
promised
they
would
say
nothing
about
it
couldn
t
you
come
with
us
and
show
us
the
way
said
jack
but
timothy
shook
his
head
i
rather
you
tell
me
about
it
afterwarth
he
said
i
had
enough
of
the
wood
ith
too
full
of
crackly
noith
i
ran
all
the
way
home
he
confessed
oh
and
thereth
one
thig
don
t
let
mr
papingay
know
you
ve
come
for
the
leaf
he
th
a
funny
old
man
perapth
he
wouldn
t
let
you
have
it
wait
till
you
thee
it
it
wath
on
the
kitchen
window
i
thaw
the
children
thanked
timothy
and
were
discussing
eagerly
s
plans
when
miss
marigold
looked
in
to
say
all
was
ready
upstairs
i
heard
you
laughing
a
lot
just
now
timothy
she
remarked
that
made
you
very
excited
i
m
umth
agreed
timothy
meekly
the
children
were
very
tired
that
night
and
in
spite
of
their
excitement
they
slept
soundly
in
the
comfortable
warm
beds
miss
marigold
had
prepared
for
them
their
first
waking
thoughts
were
of
the
in
mr
papingay
s
house
they
longed
to
be
off
to
the
orange
wood
without
delay
but
they
discovered
on
arriving
downstairs
that
the
village
had
made
other
plans
for
them
somehow
the
news
had
spread
that
two
people
from
the
impossible
world
had
come
to
search
the
village
for
the
black
leaf
and
the
villagers
meant
to
welcome
them
handsomely
and
give
them
all
the
help
they
could
during
breakfast
the
children
noticed
that
people
kept
stopping
and
peering
in
through
the
window
at
them
and
from
remarks
dropped
by
miss
marigold
they
understood
that
they
would
create
great
disappointment
if
not
give
real
offence
unless
they
searched
the
village
thoroughly
that
in
sight
of
the
people
jack
and
molly
began
to
feel
as
if
they
were
a
sort
of
show
or
entertainment
however
they
talked
things
over
together
and
calculating
that
the
village
ought
not
to
take
more
than
a
few
hours
to
it
was
very
decided
that
perhaps
they
had
better
search
it
first
and
then
in
the
afternoon
start
off
into
the
orange
wood
after
all
timothy
might
have
made
a
mistake
and
the
leaf
might
be
in
the
village
after
all
it
would
never
do
to
pass
it
by
so
they
set
to
work
immediately
after
breakfast
much
refreshed
by
their
long
sleep
and
the
wholesome
good
food
that
miss
marigold
had
set
before
them
they
thanked
her
warmly
and
said
to
timothy
then
stepped
out
into
another
day
of
sunshine
but
they
had
reckoned
their
time
without
the
villagers
so
insistent
and
eager
were
they
to
help
the
children
that
they
hindered
and
delayed
them
in
every
way
children
and
men
and
women
suggested
likely
places
where
the
black
leaf
might
be
growing
and
insisted
on
taking
jack
and
molly
to
the
places
but
each
search
proved
in
vain
they
searched
a
field
by
special
request
of
the
man
who
owned
it
and
who
expressed
great
surprise
when
told
that
the
leaf
was
not
there
although
he
knew
very
well
that
the
leaf
was
not
there
as
he
had
already
gone
over
the
field
himself
still
he
felt
he
couldn
t
have
his
ground
neglected
when
all
his
neighbours
fields
were
being
searched
and
one
old
lady
insisted
on
digging
up
her
window
box
to
show
them
that
the
leaf
wasn
t
there
conscious
of
the
importance
she
was
gaining
in
the
eyes
of
her
neighbours
while
the
children
stayed
about
her
place
the
attention
they
received
made
the
children
rather
uncomfortable
however
every
garden
every
yard
of
roadway
every
field
and
lane
and
paddock
and
even
every
having
been
searched
to
the
villagers
and
the
children
s
satisfaction
jack
and
molly
at
length
said
to
the
village
and
turned
eagerly
toward
the
orange
wood
the
afternoon
was
well
advanced
by
this
time
and
the
sun
gleaming
through
the
trees
in
the
wood
turned
the
gold
and
brown
leaves
on
the
branches
to
a
mass
of
flaming
colour
chapter
xiv
papingay
s
house
in
the
orange
as
soon
as
the
children
entered
the
wood
all
sounds
of
life
seemed
to
die
away
and
everything
was
still
no
birds
sang
or
fluttered
overhead
no
little
wood
animals
scurried
through
the
dry
dead
leaves
on
the
ground
no
breeze
rustled
the
golden
leaves
on
the
trees
the
sun
shone
softly
through
the
branches
and
cast
a
strange
shimmer
over
the
accounted
for
the
name
by
which
the
wood
was
known
as
jack
and
molly
went
along
they
found
themselves
talking
to
each
other
in
whispers
afraid
to
disturb
the
brooding
quietness
of
the
wood
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
on
the
path
seemed
unusually
loud
i
say
molly
what
do
you
say
if
we
keep
to
the
footpath
and
go
straight
to
mr
papingay
s
house
as
quickly
as
possible
and
see
if
it
really
is
the
leaf
then
we
can
search
the
rest
of
the
wood
it
isn
t
suggested
jack
molly
agreed
readily
remembering
that
it
was
rumoured
that
the
wood
was
full
of
the
pumpkin
s
spies
the
children
had
great
hopes
that
it
was
the
black
leaf
in
mr
papingay
s
for
the
spies
would
surely
be
stationed
all
around
the
place
where
the
black
leaf
grew
to
guard
it
thank
goodness
we
know
we
can
trust
mr
papingay
said
molly
if
we
can
only
find
him
oh
jack
if
only
it
is
the
leaf
won
t
it
be
splendid
molly
broke
off
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
how
awfully
quiet
everything
is
as
if
the
wood
were
oh
what
was
that
it
wasn
t
anything
don
t
molly
you
gave
me
quite
a
jump
jack
said
unsteadily
looking
over
his
shoulder
too
the
light
in
the
wood
was
beginning
to
fade
and
under
the
distant
trees
dim
shadows
gathered
i
thought
i
heard
some
twigs
snapping
sound
said
molly
well
you
needn
t
say
so
moll
if
you
did
but
anyway
i
m
not
you
nevertheless
jack
quickened
his
pace
to
a
sharp
trot
and
molly
had
some
difficulty
in
keeping
up
with
him
i
m
not
afraid
either
she
gasped
nor
am
i
repeated
jack
and
went
a
little
faster
then
they
both
began
to
run
of
not
molly
jerked
out
apologizing
as
it
were
to
herself
and
to
jack
for
their
sudden
haste
they
ran
along
the
footpath
for
a
short
distance
until
a
little
way
ahead
of
them
they
saw
an
open
space
in
the
wood
in
the
centre
of
which
stood
a
house
let
said
jack
breathlessly
they
both
pulled
up
and
stood
still
for
a
few
moments
it
wouldn
run
like
this
it
might
look
as
if
we
well
it
would
look
funny
you
molly
agreed
so
they
waited
until
they
had
got
their
breath
again
then
they
walked
casually
out
into
the
open
space
the
trees
stood
round
the
clearing
in
a
wide
circle
and
above
the
house
was
a
big
expanse
of
sky
it
seemed
quite
light
out
here
after
the
dim
light
of
the
wood
it
was
a
house
that
faced
them
but
what
it
was
about
the
house
that
made
it
queer
jack
and
molly
could
not
at
first
make
out
around
it
was
a
square
of
asphalt
and
drawing
nearer
they
saw
that
on
the
asphalt
all
round
the
four
sides
were
rows
of
narrow
white
streaks
that
looked
like
railings
lying
down
flat
and
this
is
what
they
actually
proved
to
they
were
not
real
railings
they
were
painted
on
the
ground
with
white
paint
the
children
looked
up
and
then
they
realized
what
it
was
that
made
the
house
look
funny
nearly
everything
on
it
and
about
it
was
but
painted
the
house
itself
was
real
and
so
was
the
front
door
but
the
knocker
and
handle
and
were
all
painted
on
three
of
the
windows
seemed
real
but
there
were
three
more
that
were
obviously
painted
on
and
were
obviously
the
work
of
some
one
not
greatly
skilled
in
the
art
of
painting
there
was
a
large
tree
painted
on
the
asphalt
and
a
row
of
tulips
and
a
path
bordered
by
painted
stones
that
led
up
to
the
front
door
the
children
were
gazing
at
these
things
in
astonishment
when
the
front
door
suddenly
opened
and
the
owner
of
the
house
appeared
on
the
threshold
come
inside
he
called
affably
peering
at
them
over
the
top
of
his
spectacles
the
latch
on
the
gate
pulls
downward
don
t
be
afraid
of
the
dog
he
won
t
hurt
you
if
i
speak
to
him
there
percy
there
down
sir
there
s
a
good
dog
jack
and
molly
looked
round
wonderingly
but
could
not
see
any
signs
of
a
dog
till
their
eyes
caught
sight
of
a
black
smudge
of
paint
which
proved
on
closer
acquaintance
to
be
a
black
dog
chained
to
a
red
painted
flat
on
the
ground
a
few
feet
inside
the
gate
the
children
gazed
at
each
other
questioningly
then
glan
s
words
came
back
to
them
humour
him
he
s
a
queer
old
so
molly
bent
down
and
pretended
to
pull
the
latch
on
the
gate
down
she
and
jack
walked
carefully
on
to
the
asphalt
over
the
flat
gate
then
she
turned
and
pretended
to
close
and
latch
the
gate
again
as
they
passed
the
painted
dog
she
had
another
happy
idea
good
dog
good
dog
she
said
and
stooped
and
patted
the
asphalt
the
old
man
beamed
down
upon
her
he
s
quite
harmless
when
i
tell
him
it
s
all
right
he
confided
but
you
should
just
see
him
when
he
s
roused
stand
on
the
step
and
i
ll
tell
him
there
s
a
round
the
corner
he
hates
the
children
could
not
see
a
real
step
but
spying
a
painted
white
square
by
the
front
door
they
stood
on
that
now
then
cried
the
old
man
at
em
percy
at
em
there
s
a
round
the
corner
there
was
a
dead
silence
while
the
painted
dog
gazed
with
unseeing
eyes
up
at
the
sky
and
a
little
breeze
rustled
in
the
isn
t
he
furious
chuckled
the
old
man
beaming
proudly
from
the
dog
to
the
children
go
it
old
boy
give
it
em
as
he
seemed
to
expect
an
answer
to
his
question
molly
said
looks
very
fierce
doesn
t
he
that
s
nothing
to
what
he
can
look
said
mr
papingay
obviously
delighted
at
molly
s
reply
but
come
inside
come
so
the
children
entered
the
narrow
dark
hall
and
mr
papingay
shut
the
front
door
behind
them
this
way
he
said
crushing
past
them
and
throwing
open
a
door
on
the
right
come
inside
and
sit
down
a
bit
this
is
my
study
what
do
you
think
of
it
as
the
question
was
asked
before
jack
and
molly
were
inside
the
room
there
was
naturally
a
short
interval
before
molly
could
reply
politely
what
a
all
done
by
myself
said
the
old
man
waving
his
hand
with
a
sweeping
movement
toward
the
walls
the
children
followed
the
and
saw
rows
upon
rows
of
books
painted
round
the
walls
there
was
no
doubt
about
them
being
painted
and
they
noticed
also
that
the
carpet
chairs
tables
curtains
and
even
the
fireplace
were
all
painted
in
this
amazing
room
jack
s
eyes
travelled
rapidly
over
the
room
but
not
a
single
real
thing
could
he
see
in
it
except
himself
and
molly
and
the
old
man
standing
in
front
of
him
and
he
looked
at
the
latter
twice
to
make
sure
that
he
was
real
and
not
simply
made
of
paint
like
the
other
things
but
mr
papingay
was
real
enough
with
his
spectacles
and
bald
head
the
only
hair
he
possessed
grew
like
a
fringe
at
the
back
of
his
head
low
down
just
above
the
nape
of
his
under
his
chin
a
little
fringe
of
whiskers
appeared
he
had
round
blue
eyes
and
eyebrows
set
high
that
gave
him
a
look
of
continual
surprise
over
a
suit
he
wore
a
brown
plaid
with
long
cord
and
tassels
and
on
his
feet
were
a
pair
of
very
old
red
felt
carpet
slippers
and
then
jack
s
roving
eye
noticed
that
the
buttons
on
his
were
painted
on
but
that
was
the
only
bit
of
paint
about
mr
papingay
you
see
it
s
so
handy
making
my
own
things
he
was
explaining
to
molly
i
can
have
any
kind
of
things
i
like
and
change
them
as
often
as
i
don
t
you
find
the
chairs
rather
awkward
to
sit
on
inquired
jack
not
at
all
why
should
i
replied
the
old
man
slightly
offended
you
re
not
real
are
they
jack
blundered
on
not
real
what
do
you
mean
snapped
mr
papingay
of
course
they
re
real
sit
on
one
and
don
t
be
silly
jack
molly
broke
in
they
certainly
look
most
comfortable
i
do
think
it
is
clever
of
you
to
make
them
she
said
to
the
old
man
oh
no
no
not
at
all
simple
enough
said
mr
papingay
airily
appeased
at
once
but
you
try
one
they
may
look
comfortable
but
it
s
nothing
to
what
they
are
to
sit
on
you
try
one
he
urged
so
molly
pretended
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
painted
chairs
it
was
a
most
curious
sensation
although
she
knew
there
was
no
chair
there
she
felt
somehow
as
if
she
really
were
sitting
on
a
chair
so
that
when
the
old
man
asked
her
with
a
smile
on
his
face
now
isn
t
it
comfortable
she
could
answer
truthfully
yes
it
really
yet
afterward
jack
told
her
that
he
had
tried
one
of
the
chairs
when
she
and
the
old
man
were
not
looking
and
had
nearly
fallen
on
the
floor
i
found
it
anything
but
silly
old
ass
he
said
when
they
had
admired
the
study
to
the
old
man
s
content
he
led
them
out
into
the
hall
again
and
up
the
stairs
to
a
curious
little
room
he
called
his
visitors
room
as
they
went
upstairs
molly
tried
to
tell
their
host
who
they
were
and
how
they
knew
glan
and
his
father
but
he
kept
up
a
constant
stream
of
conversation
himself
and
took
no
notice
of
her
remarks
the
children
found
the
visitors
room
more
difficult
than
ever
to
be
truthful
and
yet
polite
in
it
had
been
hard
to
pretend
the
painted
was
soft
and
real
and
that
the
books
in
the
study
could
be
taken
out
and
read
but
these
things
were
nothing
compared
to
the
difficulties
in
the
visitors
room
it
was
a
small
room
furnished
with
painted
chairs
and
tables
only
in
addition
to
the
painted
furniture
were
painted
people
round
the
walls
and
on
the
floor
people
standing
people
sitting
ladies
gentlemen
girls
and
boys
some
with
hats
on
as
if
paying
an
afternoon
call
some
with
hats
off
as
if
they
had
come
to
spend
the
day
but
one
and
all
without
exception
were
simply
painted
people
on
the
panes
of
one
of
the
real
windows
was
painted
the
figure
of
a
man
back
view
this
gentleman
who
was
dressed
in
a
dull
grey
suit
and
a
high
white
collar
was
apparently
looking
out
of
the
window
illustration
one
and
all
were
simply
painted
people
as
the
children
glanced
round
at
these
queer
silent
people
hesitating
what
to
do
they
became
aware
that
the
old
man
was
murmuring
some
kind
of
introduction
to
a
painted
lady
in
bright
purple
this
is
my
dear
friend
mrs
pobjoy
he
was
saying
mrs
pobjoy
allow
me
to
introduce
you
to
my
two
little
are
your
names
by
the
way
the
children
told
him
and
took
this
opportunity
of
explaining
who
they
were
and
how
they
knew
glan
dear
me
dear
me
said
mr
papingay
how
very
extraordinary
and
he
shook
hands
affably
and
then
he
introduced
them
to
mr
gentleman
painted
on
the
wall
beside
his
wife
molly
bowed
politely
i
m
very
pleased
to
meet
you
she
said
and
gave
jack
a
nudge
with
her
elbow
howjer
do
said
jack
feeling
an
awful
ass
the
painted
lady
in
bright
purple
stared
vacantly
down
at
the
two
children
mrs
pobjoy
s
always
delighted
to
see
new
faces
aren
t
you
ma
m
ah
ha
a
regular
butterfly
a
regular
butterfly
what
do
you
say
pobjoy
and
mr
papingay
gave
the
painted
figure
of
mr
pobjoy
a
dig
in
the
ribs
then
turned
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
painted
visitors
chattering
and
laughing
and
shaking
his
head
and
here
s
little
maudie
well
and
how
is
maudie
and
he
stooped
and
playfully
flicked
the
cheeks
of
a
little
girl
with
yellow
hair
and
a
pink
frock
who
was
leaning
against
a
painted
sideboard
here
s
a
little
girl
to
see
you
maudie
you
ll
like
that
won
t
you
he
turned
to
the
children
i
m
afraid
she
s
rather
peevish
this
evening
she
is
sometimes
it
s
best
to
take
no
ll
come
round
presently
here
s
mr
waffer
here
by
the
won
t
introduce
you
to
him
just
at
present
he
s
probably
just
got
an
inspiration
i
should
think
by
the
way
he
stands
absorbed
in
the
scenery
outside
he
s
a
poet
you
know
but
come
over
here
and
let
lizzie
and
her
sister
see
he
bundled
away
across
the
room
followed
by
the
two
children
i
say
molly
whispered
jack
do
you
think
we
should
see
the
front
of
mr
waffer
through
the
window
if
we
went
outside
and
looked
up
i
like
to
see
his
why
asked
molly
with
interest
because
i
don
t
believe
he
has
one
do
remind
me
to
look
as
we
go
out
said
jack
this
the
old
man
was
saying
as
they
came
up
to
him
is
lizzie
and
here
s
her
sister
very
bright
girls
both
of
them
he
added
in
an
undertone
so
that
the
lizzie
should
not
hear
and
so
he
moved
on
introducing
them
to
one
after
the
other
and
it
began
to
look
as
if
he
would
never
tear
himself
away
from
the
visitors
room
at
length
molly
told
him
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
stay
much
longer
as
they
wished
to
get
out
of
the
orange
wood
before
darkness
came
down
oh
you
mustn
t
go
yet
he
protested
i
ve
got
a
lot
more
to
show
you
yet
ah
and
that
reminds
me
but
first
you
must
come
and
see
my
kitchen
arrangements
they
are
absolutely
and
then
i
have
something
very
exciting
to
tell
he
nodded
his
head
mysteriously
jack
and
molly
exchanged
significant
glances
as
they
followed
him
downstairs
it
struck
them
that
although
he
was
introducing
them
to
everything
and
everybody
in
his
house
yet
he
had
never
troubled
to
introduce
himself
he
had
forgotten
about
that
he
led
the
way
to
the
kitchen
and
the
children
noticed
in
passing
a
servant
carrying
a
tray
painted
on
the
passage
wall
a
few
yards
from
the
kitchen
door
how
tiresome
it
must
be
for
her
never
to
get
any
farther
thought
molly
but
she
didn
t
say
anything
the
kitchen
was
very
like
the
other
rooms
nearly
all
paint
it
worried
molly
a
little
to
notice
that
the
sink
was
painted
on
the
wall
and
she
wondered
however
mr
papingay
managed
to
wash
up
the
cups
and
saucers
in
the
tin
bowl
that
was
painted
inside
the
sink
especially
as
the
taps
and
cups
and
saucers
appeared
to
be
real
but
she
was
afraid
to
ask
any
questions
in
case
it
delayed
the
exciting
news
that
they
were
longing
to
hear
a
quick
glance
at
the
kitchen
window
sill
on
entering
the
room
showed
them
that
there
was
no
there
now
after
mr
papingay
had
taken
them
a
tour
of
the
kitchen
and
they
had
admired
everything
from
the
oven
with
the
painted
round
of
beef
on
the
shelf
to
the
painted
hanging
on
the
dresser
their
host
bade
them
be
seated
on
a
bench
by
the
kitchen
happened
to
be
a
real
bench
much
to
jack
s
then
he
said
there
is
something
i
think
you
ought
to
he
shut
the
kitchen
door
carefully
so
that
the
servant
painted
in
the
passage
should
not
hear
while
the
children
s
hearts
began
to
beat
rapidly
mr
papingay
came
back
and
stood
before
them
the
grey
pumpkin
has
returned
to
this
land
he
said
solemnly
then
waited
for
the
exclamations
of
amazement
which
did
not
come
of
course
we
know
said
jack
after
a
short
pause
mr
papingay
looked
both
surprised
and
offended
why
how
s
this
he
asked
and
the
children
told
him
and
explained
about
the
search
they
were
making
well
well
well
he
said
at
length
i
ve
been
searching
for
the
black
leaf
too
i
searched
every
inch
of
the
orange
wood
thoroughly
directly
i
heard
the
pumpkin
was
back
again
is
what
i
really
wanted
to
tell
do
you
think
i
did
when
i
found
that
the
black
leaf
wasn
t
anywhere
in
the
wood
he
asked
excitedly
what
cried
both
children
together
painted
a
black
leaf
he
said
triumphantly
beaming
with
joy
and
here
it
he
opened
a
cupboard
door
behind
him
and
disclosed
a
which
was
real
in
which
grew
a
black
leaf
which
was
painted
in
fact
it
was
so
entirely
artificial
that
it
wasn
t
even
a
real
leaf
coloured
black
it
was
cut
out
of
newspaper
and
painted
with
a
thick
black
paint
jack
and
molly
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
or
two
they
could
not
they
were
so
thoroughly
disappointed
had
they
wasted
all
this
valuable
time
humouring
mr
papingay
for
nothing
more
than
this
they
had
hardly
realized
how
high
their
hopes
had
been
until
now
when
they
were
flung
to
the
ground
it
was
with
an
effort
that
molly
kept
back
her
tears
as
for
jack
he
felt
he
would
like
to
kick
something
meanwhile
mr
papingay
was
perplexed
at
their
silence
he
lifted
the
pot
down
and
set
it
on
the
floor
in
front
of
the
bench
well
what
do
you
think
of
it
he
asked
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
asked
jack
i
will
tell
you
said
mr
papingay
i
have
decided
that
you
shall
have
the
leaf
and
take
it
back
to
the
city
i
was
wondering
only
yesterday
whom
i
could
send
it
by
it
isn
t
time
for
my
yearly
visit
to
the
city
yet
and
besides
percy
has
rather
a
nasty
little
can
t
leave
him
till
he
s
better
poor
old
but
it
won
t
the
same
as
the
real
black
leaf
said
jack
why
not
why
not
asked
the
old
man
touchily
isn
t
magic
is
it
objected
jack
it
won
t
have
any
power
over
the
i
won
t
guarantee
that
it
isn
t
magic
though
it
may
not
have
the
same
power
over
the
pumpkin
the
old
man
admitted
but
what
s
the
odds
they
won
t
people
won
t
anyway
it
s
very
handsome
to
look
just
think
of
how
surprised
everybody
will
be
the
children
could
see
that
it
was
no
use
arguing
the
matter
mr
papingay
was
beginning
to
look
quite
hurt
and
annoyed
and
so
to
humour
him
and
to
save
any
further
delay
the
children
thanked
him
and
said
they
would
be
pleased
to
take
it
with
them
they
little
guessed
then
how
glad
they
would
be
later
on
that
they
had
taken
it
with
them
it
s
very
clever
of
you
to
make
it
said
molly
immediately
mr
papingay
s
vanished
and
he
smiled
down
at
the
leaf
in
an
affectionate
manner
oh
i
don
t
know
about
being
clever
he
said
s
not
a
bad
piece
of
work
he
admitted
modestly
well
think
we
really
must
be
going
said
molly
or
else
it
will
be
too
dark
in
the
wood
for
us
to
find
our
way
shall
we
pick
the
leaf
and
take
it
with
us
then
it
looks
so
well
in
the
like
it
best
in
the
the
too
said
mr
papingay
i
shall
be
coming
to
the
city
in
a
few
days
and
then
you
must
tell
me
all
about
the
people
said
when
they
saw
it
suppose
you
going
straight
back
to
the
city
he
inquired
you
won
t
want
to
bother
to
search
for
the
other
black
leaf
now
until
you
see
what
the
people
say
to
this
one
i
m
mr
papingay
he
actually
thought
the
children
would
be
more
anxious
to
hear
what
people
said
about
his
leaf
than
to
continue
their
search
for
the
real
leaf
but
the
children
were
quite
determined
about
continuing
their
work
and
at
length
made
him
understand
that
they
must
go
on
but
they
were
hoping
they
said
to
return
to
the
city
shortly
when
they
would
be
very
pleased
to
show
his
leaf
mr
papingay
cheered
up
a
bit
at
this
and
said
they
had
better
take
it
then
as
they
would
be
bound
to
reach
the
city
before
him
then
he
asked
them
where
they
were
going
to
search
next
you
needn
t
bother
about
this
ve
searched
it
from
end
to
end
i
told
you
and
besides
said
mr
papingay
it
isn
t
wise
to
linger
in
this
wood
just
now
the
pumpkin
has
spies
about
all
over
the
place
of
course
they
never
touch
wouldn
t
let
you
and
i
m
quite
certain
the
leaf
isn
t
in
this
i
d
have
had
it
before
the
children
had
not
much
faith
in
mr
papingay
s
careful
searching
but
glancing
through
the
window
they
saw
that
it
was
now
getting
too
dark
to
search
the
wood
that
night
they
had
better
get
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
possible
even
if
they
had
to
return
and
search
it
in
the
morning
they
became
aware
of
mr
papingay
murmuring
something
in
the
way
of
an
apology
for
not
asking
them
to
stay
over
night
he
was
already
overcrowded
with
visitors
the
pobjoys
and
others
he
said
he
knew
of
a
nice
little
farmhouse
outside
the
wood
where
they
would
be
comfortable
the
children
were
pleased
to
know
of
the
farmhouse
not
for
worlds
would
they
have
spent
a
night
in
this
silent
wood
mr
papingay
was
so
careless
he
would
be
sure
to
leave
a
window
unfastened
and
the
pumpkin
s
spies
would
creep
out
from
the
trees
and
get
into
the
house
at
least
this
is
what
the
children
felt
but
they
thanked
mr
papingay
and
told
him
not
to
apologize
at
all
as
they
really
couldn
t
stay
but
must
go
along
i
ll
tell
you
what
then
said
mr
papingay
i
ll
just
get
my
lantern
and
come
along
with
you
and
show
you
the
quickest
way
out
of
the
wood
to
the
the
children
were
much
relieved
at
this
feeling
that
company
and
a
light
in
the
dusky
wood
before
them
was
an
unexpected
blessing
after
a
great
deal
of
fuss
and
bustle
he
found
his
lantern
and
escorted
them
through
the
front
some
final
words
of
instruction
to
percy
who
remained
gazing
pensively
up
at
the
evening
sky
they
passed
through
the
gate
or
rather
stepped
off
the
asphalt
and
started
out
mr
papingay
insisted
on
carrying
his
and
leaf
until
he
should
have
to
part
with
it
at
the
end
of
the
wood
so
with
this
under
his
left
arm
and
his
lantern
swinging
in
his
right
hand
he
strode
ahead
of
the
children
crying
cheerily
come
along
come
along
i
ll
show
you
a
short
cut
out
of
the
wood
ah
i
m
glad
i
brought
my
ll
be
dark
enough
in
some
parts
of
the
the
children
followed
gazing
with
puzzled
expressions
at
his
lantern
then
they
understood
there
would
be
no
light
from
it
in
the
darkest
parts
of
the
wood
for
it
was
only
a
painted
lantern
chapter
xv
s
the
children
were
obliged
to
walk
quickly
in
order
to
keep
pace
with
their
guide
who
trotted
along
rapidly
never
troubling
to
glance
round
to
see
if
they
were
coming
once
they
had
left
the
clearing
and
the
queer
little
house
behind
them
and
plunged
into
the
wood
they
found
it
quite
dark
and
darker
still
as
they
got
farther
in
strange
crackly
noises
could
be
heard
from
time
to
time
behind
the
bushes
and
trees
which
suggested
all
sorts
of
things
to
you
if
you
happened
to
be
a
little
girl
or
boy
with
a
fairly
active
imagination
of
course
there
was
always
old
nancy
s
the
darkness
grew
unbearable
both
jack
and
molly
remembered
the
matches
but
they
did
not
feel
quite
sure
whether
this
was
the
proper
time
to
use
them
as
they
were
afraid
of
offending
their
guide
if
they
suggested
that
his
lantern
did
not
give
enough
light
they
trotted
along
in
silence
for
a
time
until
a
particularly
loud
crack
behind
a
bush
close
by
startled
molly
and
made
her
feel
that
she
could
not
bear
the
silence
any
longer
don
t
you
find
it
very
lonely
by
yourself
in
the
wood
she
asked
the
hurrying
figure
in
front
of
her
eh
asked
mr
papingay
it
was
such
a
relief
to
talk
that
molly
gladly
repeated
her
question
not
a
bit
of
it
replied
the
old
man
without
slackening
his
pace
or
turning
round
why
should
i
i
have
plenty
of
percy
to
take
care
of
yes
but
aren
t
you
afraid
anything
asked
molly
robbers
the
old
man
chuckled
i
should
like
to
see
the
robber
that
could
get
past
percy
besides
what
is
there
to
steal
that
s
the
best
of
a
house
like
mine
you
see
no
one
can
take
things
from
me
i
get
all
the
use
and
pleasure
i
want
out
of
the
things
i
when
i
want
new
things
i
paint
the
old
ones
out
and
paint
fresh
ones
in
their
place
and
they
can
t
be
re
of
no
use
to
any
one
else
you
see
as
for
the
pumpkin
s
spies
he
continued
in
a
loud
voice
that
made
jack
and
molly
shudder
in
case
he
were
overheard
i
m
not
afraid
of
never
touch
me
molly
gave
a
little
scream
as
something
swept
past
her
head
brushing
her
forehead
as
it
did
so
it
s
only
a
bat
molly
don
t
be
a
silly
said
jack
in
a
shaky
voice
there
s
heaps
of
them
owls
said
mr
papingay
continuing
his
rapid
walk
without
a
moment
s
pause
as
if
to
confirm
his
words
there
came
a
mournful
hoo
hoo
hoo
from
the
depths
of
the
wood
the
children
gripped
each
other
s
arms
tightly
and
hastened
on
another
minute
and
a
patch
of
light
appeared
in
the
distance
and
the
children
saw
that
it
was
the
end
of
the
wood
there
said
the
old
man
as
they
came
out
from
the
trees
at
last
you
can
find
your
way
now
can
t
you
i
must
get
doesn
t
like
me
to
stay
out
very
late
that
is
the
farmhouse
over
there
straight
across
this
field
over
the
stile
and
the
wooden
bridge
across
the
river
and
a
few
minutes
walk
up
the
hill
on
the
other
side
you
can
see
where
i
mean
can
t
you
and
he
pointed
the
farm
out
to
the
children
you
can
mention
my
name
to
rose
knows
me
well
now
if
you
will
take
this
he
said
passing
the
containing
his
precious
leaf
into
molly
s
keeping
and
take
care
of
it
i
shall
see
you
both
again
shortly
i
hope
thank
you
so
much
for
bringing
us
this
short
cut
out
of
the
wood
said
molly
it
was
awfully
kind
of
rather
said
jack
then
relieved
at
being
safely
out
of
the
wood
he
added
generously
i
lantern
s
a
marvel
the
old
man
nodded
and
beamed
delightedly
then
waving
his
hand
he
stepped
back
into
the
wood
his
painted
lantern
swinging
at
his
side
and
disappeared
as
soon
as
mr
papingay
had
gone
jack
and
molly
stopped
and
looked
around
them
they
were
in
the
open
country
once
more
but
a
more
hilly
country
than
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
wood
for
they
had
passed
right
through
the
wood
and
come
out
at
the
opposite
end
the
wood
led
straight
out
into
a
field
across
which
a
narrow
footpath
straggled
to
a
stile
set
in
the
middle
of
green
hedges
on
the
other
side
of
the
stile
was
a
path
and
a
little
white
wooden
bridge
across
the
river
and
on
the
farther
side
of
the
river
were
hills
and
the
the
red
roofs
and
whitewashed
walls
of
several
cottages
and
other
could
be
seen
here
and
there
evening
was
closing
in
rapidly
and
while
they
had
been
in
the
wood
dark
clouds
had
drifted
up
and
were
now
gathering
threateningly
overhead
it
s
too
dark
to
do
any
more
searching
said
jack
i
suppose
we
d
better
make
straight
for
the
farm
and
come
back
and
search
all
round
here
in
the
i
suppose
that
would
be
best
said
molly
i
don
t
feel
at
all
satisfied
about
the
orange
wood
do
you
jack
i
think
we
must
come
back
and
search
that
it
doesn
t
look
a
very
big
as
the
children
turned
to
look
back
at
the
wood
the
first
spots
of
rain
began
to
come
down
so
they
hastened
along
the
path
toward
the
stile
i
wonder
if
mr
papingay
really
has
searched
it
thoroughly
said
molly
he
seems
such
a
funny
old
don
t
know
what
to
i
do
laughed
jack
mr
papingay
s
much
too
to
search
it
carefully
no
moll
i
m
afraid
we
ve
got
to
do
it
it
won
t
be
so
bad
in
daylight
my
word
how
the
rain
is
coming
down
we
re
in
for
a
storm
i
should
they
hurried
on
climbed
the
stile
but
when
they
got
on
to
the
bridge
molly
stopped
for
a
moment
i
say
jack
she
called
and
jack
stopped
too
i
m
going
to
throw
this
in
the
s
too
heavy
to
take
all
the
way
with
us
and
i
don
t
like
to
put
it
down
in
the
field
in
case
mr
papingay
comes
along
and
finds
she
pulled
the
leaf
out
of
the
pot
folded
it
up
and
pushed
it
into
her
satchel
then
threw
the
pot
into
the
swiftly
flowing
river
what
are
you
keeping
the
leaf
for
cried
jack
he
had
to
raise
his
voice
to
be
heard
through
the
rising
gale
oh
i
couldn
t
throw
that
away
said
molly
and
besides
it
may
come
in
useful
she
added
as
she
ran
along
beside
jack
up
the
hill
you
never
won
t
old
timothy
feel
sold
when
he
hears
what
his
black
leaf
really
was
chuckled
jack
the
rain
was
coming
down
heavily
as
they
reached
the
front
door
of
the
they
knocked
and
rang
at
the
no
one
answered
and
there
was
no
sound
within
the
house
they
knocked
again
then
went
round
and
knocked
at
the
back
door
but
still
no
one
came
and
they
began
to
fear
that
there
was
nobody
at
home
this
proved
to
be
the
case
the
stables
and
outhouses
were
all
locked
up
although
they
could
hear
a
horse
inside
one
of
the
buildings
and
there
were
some
fowls
in
a
in
the
yard
evidently
the
people
were
only
out
for
a
short
time
so
jack
and
molly
decided
to
take
shelter
in
the
porch
by
the
front
door
for
a
while
until
the
storm
was
over
or
farmer
rose
returned
oh
dear
what
a
dreadful
night
it
s
going
to
be
said
molly
are
you
very
wet
jack
hardly
a
bit
it
s
quite
comfortable
in
this
porch
jack
replied
and
then
she
heard
him
chuckling
i
was
just
thinking
of
old
mr
papingay
he
explained
and
then
he
broke
off
with
a
sudden
exclamation
oh
bother
what
is
it
molly
asked
i
clean
forgot
to
look
for
mr
waffer
s
face

didn
t

jack

molly

orange

t
let
mr
papingay
see
us
though
what
fun
it
ll
be
like
playing
said
jack
goodness
how
the
wind
howling
they
remained
quiet
for
a
time
huddled
up
in
the
porch
the
storm
was
growing
still
worse
and
it
was
very
dark
now
presently
the
silence
in
the
porch
was
broken
by
jack
exclaiming
again
bother
what
is
it
now
inquired
molly
oh
i
say
ve
lost
i
ve
lost
my
box
of
nancy
s
a
thorough
search
of
jack
s
satchel
and
all
his
pockets
proved
that
this
was
unfortunately
true
they
must
have
fallen
me
see
had
them
just
before
we
climbed
the
stile
i
m
sure
of
that
because
i
put
my
hand
in
my
satchel
to
get
one
of
those
sweet
squares
and
i
remember
feeling
the
jack
tried
hard
to
think
back
i
believe
i
must
have
dropped
them
somewhere
just
by
the
bridge
here
molly
hold
my
satchel
and
things
a
sec
will
you
and
i
ll
just
run
down
to
the
bridge
and
fetch
the
i
m
sure
now
i
heard
something
fall
on
the
bridge
i
won
t
be
a
couple
of
minutes
you
wait
here
molly
i
ll
be
ever
so
quick
no
it
isn
t
raining

jack
cried
molly
its
so
dark
and
wet
oh
jack
don
t
go
i
ve
still
got
my
matches
mind
yours
but
jack
was
hardly
listening
it
s
only
just
down
the
t
be
a
wait
must
get
them
may
need
them
it
isn
t
so
can
see
all
wait
wait
jack
oh
i
me
strike
one
of
my
matches
and
see
if
it
can
find
the
other
box
for
molly
was
fumbling
in
her
satchel
quickly
but
jack
hadn
t
heard
her
and
had
started
off
impetuously
calling
back
shall
be
back
in
a
minute
wait
there
i
m
coming
too
called
molly
but
the
wind
howled
past
and
jack
did
not
hear
as
he
raced
down
the
hill
fastening
up
jack
s
satchel
and
slipping
it
over
her
shoulders
together
with
her
own
satchel
and
clasping
her
own
box
of
matches
firmly
in
her
hand
molly
set
out
after
her
brother
calling
his
name
as
she
ran
it
was
very
silly
of
jack
to
tear
off
like
this
she
thought
but
she
was
only
anxious
to
get
him
back
safely
in
the
porch
again
out
of
the
darkness
and
the
rain
she
did
not
stop
to
light
one
of
her
matches
until
she
was
about
down
the
hill
then
she
stopped
and
struck
one
no
ordinary
match
would
have
kept
alight
a
second
in
such
a
storm
but
old
nancy
s
matches
as
she
already
knew
were
not
ordinary
the
light
gathered
all
on
one
side
as
usual
pointing
straight
down
the
hill
molly
had
just
time
to
see
the
figure
of
jack
running
in
front
of
had
reached
the
the
match
flame
veered
right
round
and
pointed
up
the
hill
molly
turned
and
looked
but
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
there
what
did
it
mean
she
hastened
on
down
the
hill
and
as
her
match
went
out
she
lit
another
one
this
time
the
light
from
the
match
showed
her
that
jack
was
on
the
bridge
and
had
crossed
over
to
the
footpath
and
was
bending
down
to
pick
something
up
so
he
had
found
his
matches
but
even
as
she
saw
jack
her
eye
caught
sight
of
something
coming
from
the
direction
of
the
orange
wood
along
the
river
bank
toward
the
bridge
then
the
flame
from
the
match
veered
round
and
pointed
up
the
hill
but
not
before
molly
had
seen
what
it
was
that
was
creeping
toward
jack
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
it
was
the
grey
pumpkin
and
jack
had
not
seen
him
and
the
match
flame
was
pointing
the
way
of
escape
up
the
hill
to
safety
just
as
the
flame
had
pointed
out
the
way
of
escape
in
the
underground
cellar
but
there
was
no
thought
of
her
own
safety
while
jack
was
in
such
danger
molly
dashed
forward
crying
out
jack
run
quick
come
back
look
behind
you
but
the
wind
roared
around
her
as
if
mocking
her
and
jack
never
heard
as
she
ran
she
lit
another
match
and
by
its
light
saw
that
jack
was
standing
upright
and
had
seen
the
pumpkin
close
behind
him
he
went
to
run
but
slipped
and
fell
to
his
knees
and
as
he
was
scrambling
up
again
the
pumpkin
reached
him
jack
seemed
to
collapse
all
in
a
heap
on
the
ground
and
then
there
was
no
in
his
place
another
great
grey
pumpkin
molly
pulled
up
and
stood
motionless
gazing
with
horrified
eyes
then
her
match
went
out
she
lit
another
mechanically
and
as
she
did
so
she
heard
a
terrific
crash
a
few
yards
ahead
and
saw
that
the
storm
had
broken
down
the
wooden
bridge
it
collapsed
into
the
river
and
was
caught
up
by
the
rapidly
rushing
current
and
swirled
away
if
this
hadn
t
happened
molly
would
have
been
over
the
bridge
in
another
second
forgetting
in
her
despair
that
she
could
do
no
good
and
would
only
get
caught
herself
but
as
it
was
she
was
brought
to
an
abrupt
standstill
at
the
water
s
edge
while
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
two
grey
pumpkins
rolled
slowly
away
along
the
path
toward
a
group
of
tall
dark
trees
and
so
it
was
that
the
farmer
and
his
kindly
wife
returning
home
about
half
an
hour
later
found
a
little
girl
sitting
in
the
porch
by
their
front
door
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
break
chapter
xvi
accepts
a
the
farmer
s
wife
proved
a
friend
indeed
to
molly
she
gathered
the
little
girl
up
in
her
arms
and
carried
her
indoors
made
her
put
on
some
fresh
clothes
while
she
dried
her
wet
things
before
a
blazing
fire
and
not
until
molly
had
emptied
a
big
bowl
of
hot
bread
and
milk
would
she
let
her
say
a
word
of
thanks
or
explanation
then
when
the
farmer
and
mrs
rose
and
molly
wrapped
in
a
warm
cloak
belonging
to
the
farmer
s
wife
sat
round
the
fire
molly
told
them
her
story
weeping
afresh
at
the
memory
of
jack
s
misfortune
there
there
my
dear
comforted
mrs
rose
her
own
eyes
full
of
tears
it
s
no
use
crying
you
know
what
you
have
got
to
do
is
to
determine
to
find
the
black
leaf
and
then
like
as
not
you
ll
get
your
brother
back
oh
i
determined
to
find
it
cried
molly
i
was
determined
i
find
you
must
try
to
get
a
good
rest
and
then
you
can
start
off
fresh
in
the
you
mustn
t
cry
any
more
or
you
ll
make
yourself
then
you
won
t
be
able
to
do
anything
said
mrs
rose
molly
quite
saw
the
wisdom
of
mrs
rose
s
words
and
tried
her
best
to
stop
crying
but
she
kept
thinking
about
jack
and
wondering
what
they
were
doing
to
him
and
why
the
pumpkin
had
changed
him
into
a
likeness
of
himself
supposing
she
had
to
return
home
to
mother
without
jack
she
couldn
t
she
wouldn
t
she
vowed
to
herself
she
would
stay
in
this
country
and
search
and
search
until
the
black
leaf
found
even
if
she
had
to
wait
for
years
and
here
her
tears
began
to
flow
again
to
distract
her
the
farmer
began
talking
about
the
country
around
and
the
most
likely
places
to
search
he
had
searched
all
his
own
land
he
said
directly
he
heard
the
pumpkin
was
back
and
he
had
helped
to
prepare
some
of
the
beacons
on
the
hills
around
this
district
and
he
asked
molly
if
she
knew
on
which
hills
the
beacons
were
set
molly
dried
her
eyes
got
her
map
out
and
showed
him
how
the
beacon
hills
were
marked
and
soon
she
and
the
farmer
and
mrs
rose
were
poring
over
the
map
planning
out
the
best
routes
to
take
and
discussing
the
most
likely
places
for
search
the
farmer
showed
her
all
the
places
where
the
leaf
was
growing
places
he
had
personally
searched
and
at
molly
s
request
he
marked
these
places
on
the
map
with
a
lead
pencil
molly
decided
to
herself
that
she
would
leave
these
marked
places
until
the
very
last
until
she
had
searched
all
the
more
likely
parts
round
about
she
felt
she
could
not
leave
them
out
altogether
although
she
trusted
the
farmer
absolutely
she
had
promised
to
search
each
part
herself
when
she
mentioned
mr
papingay
s
name
the
farmer
and
his
wife
smiled
and
although
they
thought
he
would
certainly
have
searched
the
orange
wood
as
he
said
he
had
yet
he
was
not
sure
to
have
done
it
thoroughly
and
they
agreed
with
molly
that
it
would
be
as
well
to
go
over
the
ground
again
if
possible
the
fact
that
the
pumpkin
was
lurking
about
there
made
all
three
of
them
think
that
probably
the
leaf
was
growing
somewhere
near
of
course
this
might
not
be
so
it
might
be
only
the
pumpkin
s
object
to
prevent
jack
and
molly
going
any
further
with
the
search
you
ll
have
to
be
very
cautious
missie
if
you
go
back
to
the
wood
said
farmer
rose
it
wouldn
t
do
for
you
to
get
caught
i
ll
be
very
it
won
t
do
for
me
to
be
afraid
or
p
r
aps
i
ll
never
get
jack
back
again
said
molly
i
mustn
t
be
afraid
of
anything
that
s
the
spirit
said
the
farmer
slapping
his
knee
and
if
there
s
anything
we
can
do
to
help
ve
only
got
to
name
shall
be
when
the
farmer
s
wife
tucked
her
up
in
bed
about
twenty
minutes
later
molly
threw
her
arms
round
her
neck
i
don
t
know
why
you
are
so
good
to
me
she
said
thank
you
so
much
i
ve
given
you
a
lot
of
trouble
i
m
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
replied
the
farmer
s
wife
try
to
get
to
sleep
my
dear
p
r
aps
knows
what
may
happen
molly
was
so
exhausted
that
she
slept
soundly
and
dreamlessly
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
wind
rattled
furiously
at
her
window
and
roared
down
the
chimney
in
the
morning
she
woke
with
a
dreadful
leaden
feeling
at
her
heart
but
she
determined
not
to
brood
over
yesterday
but
to
get
to
work
at
once
after
breakfast
she
collected
up
all
the
things
from
jack
s
satchel
and
put
them
with
her
belongings
into
her
own
satchel
the
farmer
s
wife
insisted
on
giving
her
a
big
packet
of
food
for
luncheon
and
told
her
to
come
back
and
sleep
at
the
farm
again
that
night
if
she
ended
her
day
s
search
anywhere
near
molly
thanked
her
gratefully
then
started
out
alone
the
rain
had
ceased
and
the
wind
was
much
less
violent
but
it
was
a
grey
day
with
a
sky
full
of
scurrying
clouds
and
now
began
a
long
wearying
time
for
molly
alone
of
course
the
task
of
searching
was
longer
and
more
difficult
though
the
enthusiasm
with
which
she
went
to
work
kept
her
from
realizing
this
to
the
full
she
went
on
her
way
searching
eagerly
and
thoroughly
that
part
of
the
valley
through
which
the
river
ran
which
came
within
her
square
of
map
she
crossed
the
water
by
another
bridge
about
a
mile
away
from
the
place
of
last
night
s
accident
and
searched
the
opposite
bank
gradually
working
her
way
back
to
the
spot
where
the
pumpkin
had
appeared
across
the
water
she
could
see
the
up
the
hilly
road
on
the
other
side
behind
her
was
the
stile
which
she
and
jack
had
clambered
over
yesterday
was
it
only
yesterday
seemed
more
like
a
week
ago
to
molly
she
climbed
over
the
stile
again
and
crossed
the
field
searching
as
she
went
to
the
orange
wood
very
cautiously
she
entered
the
wood
and
started
her
search
ears
and
eyes
constantly
on
the
alert
and
hands
and
feet
ready
to
spring
and
climb
up
a
tree
at
any
moment
if
the
need
arose
but
the
need
did
not
arise
and
presently
molly
found
she
was
back
within
sight
of
mr
papingay
s
house
she
went
extra
carefully
now
so
as
not
to
attract
the
old
man
s
attention
and
made
a
tour
of
the
wood
near
his
house
working
in
a
wide
circle
so
as
not
to
cross
the
space
before
his
front
door
once
she
heard
his
voice
calling
out
to
know
what
percy
was
barking
at
but
she
did
not
see
him
and
though
at
length
she
searched
the
whole
of
the
orange
wood
she
did
not
find
the
black
leaf
nor
did
she
see
any
sign
of
the
pumpkin
or
his
spies
so
she
left
the
wood
behind
her
and
came
back
over
the
river
and
made
her
way
to
the
again
where
she
had
tea
and
told
them
all
about
her
day
s
search
but
she
would
not
stay
the
night
there
as
there
was
still
a
long
light
evening
to
work
through
and
she
hoped
to
get
some
way
on
the
road
to
lake
desolate
before
the
night
fell
you
ll
pass
several
houses
and
cottages
on
the
road
said
mrs
rose
and
proceeded
to
give
molly
the
names
of
several
friends
of
hers
whom
she
could
trust
but
be
sure
to
come
back
here
if
you
want
mrs
rose
stood
at
the
gate
waving
her
handkerchief
to
molly
until
the
little
girl
turned
round
a
bend
in
the
road
and
was
lost
to
sight
then
she
dabbed
her
eyes
with
the
handkerchief
bless
the
child
she
said
as
she
hurried
indoors
she
deserves
to
from
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
close
by
molly
found
she
could
get
a
splendid
view
of
the
surrounding
country
the
clouds
had
disappeared
by
now
and
it
promised
to
be
a
beautiful
evening
and
a
moonlight
night
the
river
sparkled
beneath
and
the
orange
wood
glowed
in
the
evening
sun
while
far
away
in
the
distance
she
could
see
the
white
towers
of
the
city
looking
down
at
the
orange
wood
she
suddenly
remembered
that
she
had
forgotten
to
look
for
mr
waffer
s
face
as
she
passed
mr
papingay
s
house
what
a
pity
jack
would
have
liked
to
know
she
met
him
again
but
she
had
had
so
many
things
to
think
about
in
the
wood
that
it
is
no
wonder
she
forgot
about
mr
waffer
descending
the
hill
molly
started
on
the
road
to
lake
desolate
it
was
pretty
and
green
at
first
with
cottages
dotted
about
in
small
clusters
and
presently
she
passed
through
a
tiny
village
where
she
stopped
to
inquire
and
search
but
although
every
one
seemed
kind
and
eager
to
help
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
or
seen
of
the
black
leaf
about
half
a
mile
outside
the
village
molly
came
to
a
few
more
houses
and
a
small
shop
at
the
door
of
the
shop
stood
an
old
gentleman
wearing
a
black
and
a
long
shabby
coat
when
he
saw
molly
approaching
he
came
out
to
meet
her
and
seizing
her
hand
shook
it
warmly
saying
that
he
had
heard
of
her
goodness
in
helping
with
the
search
and
thanked
her
gratefully
i
have
been
keeping
a
watch
on
the
road
for
the
last
few
days
missie
hoping
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
you
as
you
passed
he
said
i
heard
you
were
coming
this
molly
was
pleased
at
his
impulsive
friendliness
especially
as
she
was
feeling
very
lonely
just
now
she
stopped
chatting
for
a
few
minutes
and
the
old
gentleman
proudly
showed
her
his
shop
he
was
a
watchmaker
and
the
shop
was
full
of
watches
and
clocks
of
all
kinds
and
sizes
besides
these
he
had
a
small
collection
of
jewellery
i
expect
you
wonder
at
a
watchmaker
being
right
out
here
he
said
noting
molly
s
surprised
expression
at
the
contents
of
his
shop
many
people
wonder
at
first
but
i
supply
the
clocks
and
watches
for
all
the
neighbouring
towns
and
villages
and
even
for
the
city
i
send
to
the
city
twice
a
week
i
live
out
here
simply
because
my
father
and
grandfather
and
have
always
lived
in
this
because
my
health
won
t
permit
me
to
live
in
crowded
towns
now
miss
if
you
will
be
so
good
i
want
you
to
accept
a
little
present
from
me
as
a
token
of
appreciation
of
the
work
you
are
he
opened
a
little
box
and
drew
out
a
dainty
silver
bracelet
that
jingled
as
he
handled
the
very
kind
of
bracelet
that
molly
had
longed
for
on
her
birthday
molly
s
face
lit
up
but
she
hesitated
ought
she
to
accept
this
present
from
a
as
she
had
made
up
her
mind
not
to
trust
anybody
now
unless
she
was
perfectly
sure
they
were
all
right
the
old
watchmaker
seemed
harmless
enough
and
he
was
already
looking
disappointed
at
her
hesitation
molly
felt
it
would
be
unkind
to
refuse
the
bracelet
and
difficult
also
it
was
not
as
if
he
had
offered
her
food
or
drink
that
might
be
poisoned
nor
had
he
made
any
effort
to
entice
her
into
his
shop
she
had
merely
stepped
inside
on
the
mat
and
the
door
had
been
left
wide
open
surely
there
could
be
no
harm
in
accepting
the
bracelet
molly
argued
to
herself
it
was
so
pretty
and
she
like
to
have
it
and
anyway
if
she
felt
doubtful
afterward
she
could
always
get
rid
of
it
somehow
when
the
old
gentleman
could
not
see
her
and
be
hurt
i
beg
you
will
accept
this
bracelet
said
the
watchmaker
i
have
been
keeping
it
back
specially
for
so
molly
accepted
the
bracelet
and
the
old
gentleman
had
the
honour
as
he
put
it
of
seeing
her
slip
it
over
her
right
hand
where
it
gleamed
and
jingled
and
nearly
slipped
off
when
she
put
her
arm
down
as
she
had
longed
for
it
to
do
molly
thanked
the
old
watchmaker
and
shook
hands
with
him
again
as
she
bid
him
he
stood
at
his
door
bowing
as
molly
went
on
her
way
but
no
sooner
was
she
out
of
sight
than
he
returned
to
his
shop
and
closing
the
door
sat
down
on
a
stool
behind
the
counter
and
began
to
shake
with
silent
laughter
he
continued
to
laugh
hugging
himself
while
he
did
so
and
rocking
backward
and
forward
and
bending
himself
nearly
double
and
all
this
quite
only
sounds
in
the
shop
being
the
rapid
tick
tick
tick
and
the
steady
of
the
watches
and
clocks
around
him
chapter
xvii
meanwhile
after
walking
along
for
a
short
distance
molly
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
look
up
the
names
of
mrs
rose
s
friends
as
the
daylight
was
beginning
to
fade
and
already
the
moon
was
mounting
the
sky
she
had
scribbled
the
names
and
addresses
down
on
a
slip
of
paper
she
noted
with
a
slight
thrill
of
pleasure
the
jingle
of
the
silver
bracelet
as
she
took
the
paper
out
of
her
pocket
poor
molly
she
could
not
feel
very
happy
about
the
bracelet
of
course
as
the
weight
of
jack
s
misfortune
still
crushed
her
down
but
she
was
certainly
pleased
to
possess
such
a
bracelet
having
discovered
that
one
of
mrs
rose
s
friends
lived
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
on
she
determined
to
search
the
road
until
she
came
to
this
house
and
then
ask
if
mrs
jennet
for
that
was
the
friend
s
name
would
kindly
put
her
up
for
the
night
the
road
now
began
to
grow
wilder
and
more
rugged
while
here
and
there
beside
the
way
were
huge
rocks
and
piles
of
stones
she
passed
an
occasional
tree
but
these
had
few
leaves
on
their
branches
and
were
much
twisted
and
bent
as
though
lashed
by
many
storms
molly
continued
to
search
but
instead
of
hurrying
along
as
she
had
meant
to
she
found
herself
moving
slower
and
gradually
slower
still
and
became
aware
that
she
was
suddenly
very
tired
she
dragged
on
for
a
short
distance
i
can
t
do
any
more
searching
she
thought
to
herself
i
m
too
tired
i
ll
just
make
straight
for
the
i
wish
it
wasn
t
such
a
long
way
off
i
ll
never
get
molly
found
great
difficulty
in
keeping
her
eyes
open
now
and
if
she
hadn
t
been
so
thoroughly
exhausted
and
tired
she
might
have
been
suspicious
of
this
overwhelming
wave
of
sleep
that
had
seized
her
she
was
too
tired
to
think
or
reason
too
tired
to
be
suspicious
she
only
knew
that
her
feet
felt
as
if
they
were
made
of
lead
and
the
only
thing
she
wanted
to
do
was
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
at
once
can
t
reach
the
house
she
murmured
drowsily
must
go
to
she
stumbled
across
the
road
and
threw
herself
down
on
the
grass
by
the
wayside
oh
how
delicious
it
was
just
to
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
but
as
her
head
was
sinking
back
a
last
wave
of
consciousness
flashed
through
molly
s
mind
of
the
foolishness
of
the
thing
that
she
was
doing
going
to
sleep
by
the
roadside
and
if
the
pumpkin
came
along
she
would
never
be
able
to
save
jack
now
at
this
rallied
for
a
moment
and
pulled
herself
up
into
a
kneeling
position
she
remained
thus
for
a
moment
or
two
with
her
head
drooping
forward
then
she
struggled
to
fight
off
the
wave
of
sleep
that
was
coming
over
her
again
and
managed
to
crawl
a
few
paces
further
on
although
molly
did
not
know
it
at
the
time
this
was
one
of
the
most
critical
moments
in
her
adventure
if
she
had
given
in
and
gone
comfortably
to
sleep
by
the
roadside
this
story
would
have
had
a
very
different
ending
but
molly
did
not
give
in
her
desire
to
find
the
black
leaf
and
save
her
brother
was
so
strong
that
in
spite
of
the
great
odds
against
her
she
was
able
to
make
one
last
effort
to
reach
a
place
of
safety
though
there
was
still
no
sign
of
mrs
jennet
s
house
there
was
fortunately
a
tree
close
by
and
it
was
toward
this
tree
that
molly
slowly
groped
her
way
she
never
knew
how
long
it
took
her
to
reach
that
tree
although
it
was
standing
only
a
few
feet
away
from
her
but
with
repeated
efforts
she
at
length
reached
it
and
with
a
great
struggle
pulled
herself
up
into
a
standing
position
leaning
against
the
trunk
for
some
time
she
stood
leaning
against
the
tree
she
could
not
remember
afterward
whether
she
went
to
sleep
for
a
while
or
thought
she
must
have
gone
to
sleep
like
a
horse
standing
up
she
told
herself
but
she
had
barely
lost
consciousness
when
again
her
desire
urged
her
to
make
another
effort
this
was
the
last
effort
and
the
hardest
of
all
molly
scarcely
knew
how
she
managed
it
but
manage
she
did
to
pull
herself
up
into
the
tree
and
curl
up
among
the
lower
branches
then
immediately
she
was
asleep
all
through
the
moonlit
night
she
slept
and
did
not
move
and
if
anyone
passed
on
the
road
beneath
the
tree
that
never
knew
and
nobody
guessed
there
was
a
little
girl
lying
asleep
in
the
gnarled
old
tree
by
the
side
of
the
road
that
led
to
lake
desolate
for
little
girls
who
are
as
tired
as
molly
must
have
been
have
not
usually
the
strength
nor
the
will
to
climb
trees
at
daybreak
molly
stirred
and
threw
out
her
right
arm
so
that
it
hung
down
a
little
over
the
edge
of
one
of
the
branches
and
the
bracelet
the
jingly
silver
bracelet
slipped
down
over
her
wrist
and
as
she
moved
again
it
slid
over
her
hand
and
fell
on
to
the
ground
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
after
this
molly
seemed
more
restless
and
did
not
sleep
so
soundly
though
many
hours
went
by
and
it
was
nearly
noon
before
she
was
aroused
at
length
by
some
one
exclaiming
loudly
and
persistently
from
beneath
the
tree
and
something
cold
and
hard
grabbing
at
her
arms
and
legs
molly
sat
up
rubbing
her
eyes
and
then
became
aware
that
a
chubby
little
woman
in
a
black
and
white
check
dress
and
a
black
bonnet
was
calling
up
to
her
while
she
made
frantic
efforts
to
catch
hold
of
molly
with
the
crooked
handle
of
her
umbrella
oh
thank
goodness
you
woke
up
which
i
thought
you
never
was
going
to
cried
the
plump
little
woman
dabbing
her
face
with
her
handkerchief
such
a
fright
as
you
give
me
lying
quite
still
there
and
me
at
you
for
a
hour
or
more
though
i
d
never
you
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
your
and
and
arm
anging
down
out
of
the
tree
who
are
you
asked
molly
drowsily
i
m
glad
you
did
wake
me
maria
jennet
is
my
name
was
the
answer
i
done
my
best
to
wake
you
up
but
my
you
do
want
a
bit
of
waking
made
me
quite
ot
you
oh
are
you
mrs
jennet
said
molly
mrs
rose
s
friend
i
am
said
mrs
jennet
emphatically
why
i
was
on
my
way
to
your
house
last
night
oh
molly
gave
a
scream
oh
screamed
mrs
jennet
what
is
it
now
you
do
give
a
body
the
jumps
you
do
but
molly
did
not
answer
she
was
gazing
with
horrified
eyes
at
her
right
arm
on
the
wrist
was
a
long
grey
stain
how
had
it
come
there
what
did
it
mean
molly
rubbed
her
arm
vigorously
with
her
she
could
not
remove
the
stain
she
had
seen
a
grey
stain
like
this
before
but
where
and
then
she
remembered
it
was
on
old
nancy
s
finger
the
evening
she
slept
through
the
sunset
hour
molly
then
realized
what
had
happened
illustration
thank
goodness
you
woke
up
of
course
he
was
another
of
them
what
a
stupid
girl
i
was
to
trust
him
she
exclaimed
but
where
has
my
bracelet
gone
wait
a
minute
please
she
continued
in
reply
to
mrs
jennet
s
excited
questioning
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
in
a
she
climbed
down
from
the
tree
and
searched
about
in
the
grass
beneath
ah
here
it
is
she
cried
and
snatched
up
her
bracelet
only
to
drop
it
again
instantly
as
if
it
were
coals
for
on
the
inner
side
of
the
bracelet
she
saw
the
remains
of
a
dull
grey
powder
still
clinging
to
it
so
that
s
how
he
did
it
molly
nodded
to
herself
that
explains
she
understood
now
that
the
watchmaker
was
another
spy
employed
by
the
pumpkin
and
the
bracelet
which
she
had
accepted
from
him
had
contained
this
magic
powder
which
had
rubbed
off
on
to
her
arm
and
sent
her
to
sleep
the
old
watchmaker
was
evidently
relying
on
the
powder
acting
quickly
and
molly
overwhelmed
by
sleep
being
compelled
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
somewhere
where
the
pumpkin
could
easily
catch
her
luckily
for
molly
she
had
had
enough
will
power
to
fight
her
way
to
a
place
of
safety
and
luckily
also
the
bracelet
had
slipped
off
and
so
gradually
she
had
regained
consciousness
again
molly
had
had
a
very
narrow
escape
and
she
felt
decidedly
bewildered
as
to
the
best
way
of
winning
through
the
difficulties
around
her
of
one
thing
she
felt
certain
she
must
be
very
distrustful
of
everything
and
of
course
where
people
were
recommended
to
her
by
some
one
she
could
trust
so
far
all
the
links
in
her
chain
of
friends
had
proved
good
and
true
now
mrs
jennet
she
could
trust
mrs
jennet
surely
mrs
jennet
was
bubbling
over
with
curiosity
about
the
stain
and
the
bracelet
and
molly
answering
some
of
her
numerous
questions
asked
her
to
lend
her
the
umbrella
for
a
minute
mrs
jennet
watched
breathlessly
while
molly
dug
a
little
hole
with
the
point
then
picked
up
the
bracelet
on
the
tip
of
the
umbrella
and
dropped
it
in
the
hole
and
piled
earth
and
stones
on
it
it
might
only
bring
trouble
to
some
one
else
if
i
leave
it
here
she
said
then
she
accepted
mrs
jennet
s
kind
and
vigorous
invitation
to
go
home
with
her
and
have
a
bite
of
something
before
proceeding
on
her
way
as
they
walked
along
molly
told
her
companion
a
little
of
what
had
already
taken
place
and
what
had
happened
to
jack
at
which
mrs
jennet
protested
loudly
and
even
wept
a
little
then
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
roadway
while
she
told
molly
all
the
horrible
things
she
would
like
to
do
to
the
pumpkin
if
she
caught
him
mrs
jennet
s
house
was
only
a
short
distance
away
and
stood
with
several
other
houses
by
the
side
of
the
main
last
dwellings
these
before
you
reached
lake
desolate
which
was
about
two
miles
further
on
she
told
molly
molly
learned
that
the
men
from
these
houses
worked
in
the
mines
near
by
mrs
jennet
s
husband
worked
there
and
would
not
be
home
till
evening
while
mrs
jennet
was
bustling
about
laying
the
table
and
frying
eggs
and
bacon
molly
got
out
her
map
and
looked
to
see
where
the
mines
were
they
were
not
marked
on
her
map
at
all
and
mrs
jennet
explained
when
molly
showed
her
the
map
that
the
mines
were
just
over
the
border
of
molly
s
square
at
which
molly
was
rather
relieved
as
it
had
struck
her
that
she
might
have
to
go
down
the
mines
perhaps
to
search
for
the
black
leaf
but
on
second
thoughts
she
course
the
black
leaf
could
only
grow
above
ground
this
incident
however
called
molly
s
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
was
nearing
another
of
her
square
it
stretched
away
to
the
left
of
the
road
she
was
soon
to
go
along
so
she
would
not
have
much
country
to
search
on
that
side
but
there
was
still
a
large
piece
of
country
around
lake
desolate
are
there
no
more
houses
beyond
this
group
molly
asked
mrs
jennet
as
they
sat
down
to
their
meal
no
yes
said
mrs
jennet
that
is
not
until
you
ve
passed
lake
desolate
then
there
are
one
or
two
and
cottages
on
the
ills
very
lonely
they
must
be
too
there
s
very
few
go
to
lake
desolate
road
s
so
so
lonely
and
what
s
the
good
of
going
there
there
s
nothing
to
see
but
the
lake
and
the
ills
ave
some
more
bread
duckie
and
there
s
all
them
wild
birds
screeching
over
the
lake
ugh
fair
gives
me
the
creeps
it
does
but
forgot
you
was
going
there
fancy
a
bit
of
a
girl
like
you
well
well
p
r
aps
you
ain
t
afraid
of
being
alone
though
eh
molly
said
she
didn
t
think
she
was
i
m
fond
of
my
own
company
when
i
m
with
other
people
remarked
mrs
jennet
you
know
what
i
feel
a
little
bit
lost
by
everything
in
mrs
jennet
s
room
seemed
like
and
plump
and
loud
but
nevertheless
the
sofa
with
the
round
cushions
reminded
molly
strangely
of
its
owner
and
so
did
the
chairs
with
their
thick
arms
even
the
carpet
was
just
like
mrs
jennet
would
have
looked
if
she
had
been
a
carpet
molly
began
to
wonder
what
mr
jennet
was
like
i
ve
got
a
photo
of
there
on
the
ll
show
you
said
mrs
jennet
in
reply
to
a
question
from
molly
but
even
as
mrs
jennet
handed
the
photo
down
molly
felt
she
knew
what
he
would
be
like
and
she
was
right
he
was
exactly
like
mrs
jennet
would
have
been
if
she
had
been
a
man
he
s
a
dear
old

mrs
jennet
chattered
gaily
on
asking
and
answering
numberless
questions
molly
asked
her
if
she
could
tell
her
of
any
one
she
could
trust
who
lived
in
the
little
cottages
or
farms
beyond

eart
said
mrs
jennet
the
photo
was
of
a
refined
lady
molly
studied
it
intently
so
that
she
would
know
miss
lydia
when
she
saw
her
thank
you
very
much
said
molly
this
will
be
a
great
help
to
me
i
know
one
person
i
can
trust
but
molly
was
not
to
get
away
as
easily
as
that
once
mrs
jennet
had
got
her
beloved
album
open
she
insisted
on
showing
molly
all
the
photos
of
her
relatives
and
friends
including
mrs
rose
and
farmer
rose
i
wish
you
had
a
photo
of
yourself
about
you
said
mrs
jennet
i
d
like
you
in
the
molly
was
sorry
she
couldn
t
oblige
her
hostess
but
admired
the
collection
of
photographs
with
such
enthusiasm
that
mrs
jennet
was
enraptured
at
length
molly
managed
to
tear
herself
away
and
bidding
to
mrs
jennet
and
thanking
her
warmly
for
all
her
kindness
molly
started
out
once
more
it
was
now
early
afternoon
searching
carefully
along
the
road
and
on
either
side
of
it
she
proceeded
slowly
as
she
went
on
the
country
grew
wilder
and
lonelier
the
hills
rose
up
on
every
side
bare
gaunt
hills
on
which
nothing
seemed
to
grow
and
at
the
foot
of
the
hills
great
rocks
and
stones
were
strewn
molly
soon
left
all
signs
of
the
miners
houses
behind
her
and
as
she
looked
back
and
could
see
nothing
but
the
wild
scenery
all
around
smoke
from
a
chimney
no
sign
of
human
beings
at
began
to
feel
very
small
and
lost
and
lonely
but
she
was
not
afraid
she
realized
after
thinking
things
over
that
in
the
ordinary
way
the
pumpkin
s
spies
could
not
touch
her
or
make
her
do
things
by
force
it
had
to
be
some
carelessness
or
weakness
in
herself
which
enabled
them
to
obtain
a
power
over
her
she
would
be
very
careful
in
future
and
would
not
trust
any
one
but
those
people
who
she
were
her
friends
she
would
be
on
her
guard
all
the
time
she
searched
carefully
for
about
an
hour
in
every
likely
place
along
the
way
keeping
her
eyes
and
ears
constantly
on
the
alert
and
presently
the
latter
informed
her
of
the
galloping
of
horse
s
hoofs
in
the
distance
looking
back
along
the
road
she
saw
a
cloud
of
dust
and
by
and
by
a
big
black
horse
on
which
was
seated
a
man
in
a
slouch
hat
and
flying
cape
became
visible
molly
glanced
round
for
a
place
of
escape
if
necessary
or
a
place
to
hide
but
there
was
no
place
to
hide
in
this
barren
spot
and
no
trees
near
by
so
she
walked
steadily
on
so
long
as
it
wasn
t
the
pumpkin
the
man
on
the
horse
could
not
touch
her
against
her
is
if
he
was
an
enemy
poor
molly
expected
every
stranger
to
be
an
enemy
now
of
course
maybe
the
horse
and
rider
had
no
business
with
her
at
all
anyway
they
came
dashing
along
at
full
speed
thundering
on
the
road
behind
her
molly
drew
to
the
side
of
the
road
to
let
them
pass
but
they
did
not
pass
she
heard
with
a
sinking
heart
the
horse
gradually
slacken
its
pace
till
it
came
alongside
her
the
man
quickly
dismounted
made
molly
a
sweeping
bow
and
handed
her
a
sealed
envelope
then
without
a
word
he
sprang
into
the
saddle
and
turning
his
horse
s
head
galloped
back
along
the
road
by
which
he
had
come
leaving
molly
gazing
in
surprise
at
the
envelope
in
her
hand
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
the
man
and
the
horse
had
come
and
gone
molly
turned
the
envelope
over
and
over
there
was
no
address
on
it
to
say
who
it
was
for
or
where
it
had
come
from
only
the
word
immediate
was
printed
in
the
top
corner
what
ought
she
to
do
she
wondered
should
she
open
it
was
it
meant
for
her
was
it
from
a
was
it
another
trick
of
the
pumpkin
s
she
hesitated
standing
still
in
the
middle
of
the
lonely
road
supposing
it
was
a
about
really
true
supposing
she
didn
t
open
the
was
she
to
do
with
it
this
decided
the
matter
as
she
couldn
t
think
what
to
do
with
it
if
she
didn
t
open
it
she
opened
it
very
cautiously
and
this
was
the
letter
inside
it
dear
child
i
know
all
that
has
happened
this
is
to
tell
you
that
i
have
overheard
that
the
pumpkin
has
sent
out
many
spies
to
stop
you
one
of
them
is
a
little
old
man
a
watchmaker
he
pretends
to
be
do
not
trust
him
another
and
this
one
is
the
most
dangerous
of
all
is
a
certain
blind
woman
who
has
been
sent
out
to
meet
you
on
the
shores
of
lake
desolate
as
you
value
your
quest
as
you
value
your
poor
brother
s
life
do
not
trust
this
blind
woman
have
nothing
to
do
with
not
believe
a
word
she
go
straight
on
past
the
lake
to
the
brown
hills
beyond
otherwise
all
is
at
an
end
for
us
with
affectionate
remembrance
from
old
nancy
molly
read
the
letter
through
several
times
very
carefully
then
she
folded
it
up
and
put
it
in
her
satchel
chapter
xviii
comes
to
lake
during
the
next
two
hours
while
molly
searched
the
remainder
of
the
road
and
the
lonely
country
that
lay
between
the
road
and
the
hills
on
either
side
she
kept
thinking
of
the
letter
and
it
worried
her
she
could
not
make
up
her
mind
whether
the
letter
was
genuine
or
not
at
first
she
thought
it
really
was
from
old
nancy
and
then
because
she
had
resolved
to
trust
no
one
she
began
to
suspect
that
the
man
on
the
horse
was
another
of
the
pumpkin
s
spies
and
that
the
letter
was
faked
one
part
was
true
molly
argued
to
herself
about
the
watchmaker
but
then
the
spies
would
know
by
now
that
i
have
found
out
about
the
watchmaker
and
would
not
mind
telling
me
news
i
already
know
if
they
thought
it
would
make
the
letter
seem
more
genuine
but
why
should
they
warn
me
about
this
blind
oh
i
don
t
know
i
wonder
if
it
really
from
old
nancy
after
all
i
wish
i
had
some
means
of
finding
and
then
after
another
ten
minutes
search
i
believe
it
really
is
from
old
m
getting
too
distrustful
she
said
anyway
i
ll
wait
until
i
reach
lake
then
molly
climbed
to
the
top
of
one
of
the
hills
and
from
there
caught
her
first
glimpse
of
the
lake
it
was
not
far
away
now
but
it
was
actually
no
more
than
a
glimpse
of
the
water
that
she
got
because
of
the
hills
that
surrounded
it
she
descended
the
hill
searching
all
the
it
would
not
do
to
pass
by
any
likely
spot
in
her
anxiety
to
reach
some
other
spot
even
if
the
latter
did
sound
a
more
probable
place
for
the
black
leaf
to
be
growing
in
although
the
water
had
not
looked
far
away
yet
it
seemed
a
long
time
to
molly
before
she
reached
lake
desolate
climbing
round
the
side
of
one
of
the
hills
she
at
length
saw
the
lake
immediately
below
her
it
was
a
great
stretch
of
water
silent
dark
and
mysterious
around
which
the
hills
stood
like
sentinels
across
the
surface
of
the
water
strange
birds
hovered
flapping
their
wings
and
uttering
weird
screechings
as
mrs
jennet
had
said
every
now
and
again
they
would
swoop
down
on
the
water
or
dart
across
to
some
trees
and
rocks
on
the
opposite
shore
molly
glanced
anxiously
around
the
shores
of
the
lake
but
could
not
see
anything
moving
except
the
birds
gradually
she
made
her
way
down
the
hillside
and
stood
for
a
while
gazing
into
the
dark
still
water
it
was
well
named
lake
desolate
thought
molly
for
never
had
she
seen
such
a
deserted
lonely
place
as
she
looked
across
to
the
hills
beyond
a
slight
sound
made
her
turn
her
head
her
heart
began
to
beat
rapidly
for
coming
slowly
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
toward
her
was
a
woman
dressed
in
a
long
grey
cloak
she
had
a
stick
in
her
hand
which
she
tapped
on
the
ground
in
front
of
her
as
blind
people
do
molly
stood
perfectly
motionless
so
that
the
blind
woman
should
not
hear
her
move
and
know
that
any
one
was
near
the
woman
came
on
hesitatingly
tap
tap
tapping
with
her
stick
molly
watched
her
the
woman
passed
within
a
short
distance
of
where
molly
was
listened
then
moved
on
at
that
moment
one
of
molly
s
feet
slipped
a
little
and
the
stones
on
which
she
was
standing
moved
and
several
trickled
down
and
fell
with
a
into
the
water
the
woman
stopped
immediately
while
molly
bit
her
lip
at
her
own
carelessness
is
any
one
there
asked
the
woman
turning
and
facing
in
the
direction
whence
the
sound
had
come
molly
did
not
answer
but
looked
straight
at
the
woman
and
as
she
looked
a
puzzled
expression
came
over
molly
s
face
where
had
she
seen
the
blind
woman
s
face
before
she
seen
it
of
this
she
felt
certain
and
then
suddenly
molly
knew
it
was
the
same
face
that
she
had
seen
in
mrs
jennet
s
photo
album
it
was
the
face
of
miss
lydia
this
discovery
gave
molly
a
shock
and
sent
all
her
thoughts
and
plans
tumbling
over
each
other
what
was
she
to
do
now
meanwhile
as
no
reply
had
been
given
to
her
question
the
blind
woman
sighed
and
passed
on
molly
did
not
know
what
to
do
or
whom
to
believe
she
had
never
been
wrong
before
in
trusting
one
of
her
friend
s
friends
and
this
certainly
looked
like
the
miss
lydia
of
whom
mrs
jennet
had
spoken
but
old
nancy
written
that
letter
if
so
she
would
of
course
trust
her
before
any
one
and
obey
her
instructions
i
can
t
find
out
who
wrote
the
letter
at
least
not
yet
thought
molly
but
i
can
find
out
if
she
really
is
miss
her
mind
made
up
she
stepped
forward
a
few
paces
and
called
in
a
clear
voice
there
some
one
here
can
i
help
you
the
blind
woman
turned
eagerly
and
groped
her
way
back
toward
the
voice
oh
i
am
so
glad
to
hear
some
one
speak
who
are
you
are
you
a
friend
asked
the
woman
anxiously
i
am
so
helpless
you
know
i
am
willing
to
be
your
friend
but
who
are
you
asked
molly
what
is
your
name
my
name
is
lydia
north
replied
the
woman
and
i
live
in
a
little
waved
her
arm
vaguely
on
the
side
of
the
giant
s
head
oh
tell
me
who
you
are
please
i
am
a
little
girl
answered
molly
and
if
you
are
truly
miss
am
your
friend
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
will
you
lead
me
back
to
my
home
again
i
can
not
find
my
way
from
here
there
seem
to
be
hills
all
round
that
shut
me
in
i
can
not
find
the
way
out
and
i
am
afraid
of
walking
into
the
water
i
nearly
fell
in
just
how
did
you
get
here
miss
lydia
asked
molly
i
was
hoping
to
meet
you
at
your
jennet
told
me
about
me
to
call
and
see
you
but
i
didn
t
know
that
you
i
wasn
the
day
before
think
it
was
the
day
before
yesterday
it
seems
a
long
time
ago
i
am
not
used
to
being
blind
yet
and
feel
so
helpless
i
m
so
glad
you
are
a
friend
of
good
mrs
jennet
i
can
trust
you
said
miss
lydia
this
was
something
new
for
molly
to
have
people
doubtful
whether
she
could
be
trusted
it
was
generally
the
other
way
about
but
when
she
had
heard
miss
lydia
s
story
she
quite
understood
it
seemed
that
miss
lydia
had
been
away
from
home
for
a
fortnight
staying
with
her
sister
in
the
city
and
had
returned
home
the
day
before
yesterday
when
i
reached
my
cottage
gate
she
continued
i
heard
something
coming
behind
sort
of
soft
rolling
sound
then
something
touched
i
could
not
see
any
more
i
found
my
way
into
the
cottage
live
alone
i
kept
thinking
my
sight
would
come
back
but
it
did
not
come
back
and
this
knew
it
was
morning
by
the
cocks
crowing
and
the
clock
started
out
determined
to
find
my
way
down
to
the
high
road
which
runs
below
the
hill
so
that
i
might
get
help
but
i
lost
my
way
presently
i
heard
some
one
walking
past
me
and
they
offered
to
set
me
right
for
the
high
road
but
they
led
me
here
and
then
they
laughed
and
went
away
i
suppose
you
knew
who
it
was
that
touched
you
and
made
you
blind
said
molly
i
didn
t
see
any
one
answered
miss
lydia
but
i
can
poor
miss
lydia
another
of
the
pumpkin
s
victims
molly
felt
very
sorry
for
her
helplessness
in
this
deserted
place
molly
was
fairly
certain
now
that
the
letter
she
had
received
was
not
from
old
nancy
but
why
had
the
spies
wished
to
prevent
her
from
helping
miss
lydia
she
would
find
out
if
she
had
not
felt
sure
that
this
was
indeed
miss
lydia
she
would
have
obeyed
the
letter
and
gone
straight
on
to
the
brown
hills
i
will
lead
you
home
miss
lydia
she
said
if
you
will
trust
me
which
is
the
nearest
way
where
are
we
now
asked
miss
lydia
this
is
lake
desolate
molly
informed
her
there
are
several
lakes
near
here
said
miss
lydia
but
i
thought
we
were
somewhere
near
lake
desolate
because
of
the
so
she
told
molly
to
look
for
a
big
hill
shaped
like
a
head
which
was
somewhere
on
the
west
side
of
the
lake
when
molly
saw
it
towering
up
behind
the
other
hills
she
took
miss
lydia
by
the
hand
and
led
her
away
from
lake
desolate
they
passed
out
of
the
ring
of
hills
around
lake
desolate
and
mounted
a
hilly
path
that
led
toward
the
giant
s
head
the
country
was
very
beautiful
on
this
side
of
the
lake
but
molly
had
no
eyes
for
the
beauty
of
the
scene
at
present
she
was
trying
to
puzzle
out
the
meaning
of
her
letter
and
the
meaning
of
miss
lydia
s
story
had
the
pumpkin
any
special
purpose
in
making
miss
lydia
was
it
just
one
of
his
wicked
whims
and
why
had
his
spies
led
miss
lydia
to
this
lake
and
then
tried
to
prevent
molly
from
helping
her
surely
if
the
spies
had
wished
to
prevent
molly
from
helping
the
blind
lady
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
them
to
keep
miss
lydia
out
of
the
way
to
have
led
her
to
another
lake
on
the
other
hand
if
they
did
want
her
to
help
miss
lydia
why
had
they
sent
that
letter
the
chances
were
that
molly
would
obey
the
instructions
in
the
letter
yes
she
certainly
might
have
obeyed
she
hadn
t
seen
miss
lydia
s
photo
in
mrs
jennet
s
album
it
was
all
very
puzzling
to
molly
it
was
rather
slow
work
leading
miss
lydia
as
she
walked
hesitatingly
over
the
rough
uneven
ground
but
after
a
long
long
time
it
seemed
to
reached
the
giant
s
head
and
started
to
work
their
way
up
and
round
the
side
of
the
hill
molly
sighed
as
she
looked
back
and
thought
of
all
the
ground
she
would
have
to
go
over
again
and
from
here
to
the
brown
hills
in
the
distance
but
she
must
see
miss
lydia
safely
home
first
and
do
anything
she
could
to
help
her
she
found
herself
wondering
how
all
the
other
searchers
were
getting
on
and
whether
any
of
them
had
finished
searching
their
part
of
the
country
whether
any
of
them
were
unknowingly
nearing
success
rounding
the
hill
they
came
in
sight
of
miss
lydia
s
cottage
a
pretty
cottage
perched
on
the
hillside
it
peeped
out
of
its
bushy
garden
down
at
the
road
far
below
behind
the
cottage
the
giant
s
head
rose
up
against
the
sky
it
was
a
lovely
lonely
spot
molly
led
miss
lydia
to
the
gate
this
is
right
isn
t
it
she
asked
miss
lydia
felt
the
top
of
the
gate
yes
this
is
home
she
said
thank
you
my
dear
i
don
t
know
how
to
thank
you
you
ll
come
in
with
me
won
t
you
oh
don
t
leave
me
till
i
m
i
won
t
leave
you
till
you
re
indoors
said
molly
genuinely
sorry
for
miss
lydia
in
her
helpless
plight
she
helped
miss
lydia
to
open
her
front
door
and
the
two
entered
the
cottage
together
what
would
molly
s
feelings
have
been
had
she
looked
out
into
the
garden
a
moment
later
and
seen
the
crouching
figure
that
rose
and
emerged
from
behind
a
clump
of
bushes
as
soon
as
the
door
was
shut
it
was
an
old
woman
with
little
darting
eyes
and
a
red
scarf
wound
round
her
head
creeping
along
the
old
woman
pushed
her
way
through
a
broken
fence
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
darting
behind
a
group
of
trees
close
by
began
to
signal
wildly
to
some
one
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
chapter
xix
looks
through
miss
lydia
s
molly
led
miss
lydia
into
the
cottage
dainty
fresh
little
brought
a
chair
forward
into
which
miss
lydia
sank
gratefully
can
i
get
you
anything
shall
i
make
you
some
tea
suggested
molly
cheerfully
there
was
no
answer
and
then
she
saw
that
miss
lydia
was
crying
softly
to
herself
oh
dear
i
m
so
sorry
miss
lydia
said
molly
distressed
oh
what
can
i
do
is
there
anything
you
d
like
me
to
do
i
don
t
know
what
to
do
said
miss
lydia
i
feel
so
helpless
here
alone
if
only
i
could
get
a
message
through
to
my
sister
in
the
city
she
d
come
to
me
she
knew
what
shall
i
do
you
have
been
so
good
to
s
a
shame
to
bother
you
with
my
troubles
molly
sat
down
on
a
chair
opposite
to
miss
lydia
and
tried
to
decide
what
to
do
molly
felt
very
perplexed
and
troubled
herself
it
seemed
cruel
to
leave
miss
lydia
here
alone
in
this
deserted
spot
and
yet
if
she
took
her
with
her
it
would
cause
so
much
delay
and
time
was
getting
short
now
have
you
no
friends
near
here
that
i
could
fetch
for
you
asked
molly
miss
lydia
shook
her
head
no
one
very
near
i
came
to
live
in
this
lonely
little
house
away
from
my
friends
so
that
i
could
get
on
with
my
work
i
am
an
was
an
artist
she
corrected
herself
i
can
not
paint
pictures
now
i
can
not
watch
the
sun
sink
over
the
hills
nor
see
the
stars
reflected
in
the
water
what
shall
i
do
what
shall
i
do
she
sobbed
bitterly
oh
don
t
don
t
miss
lydia
begged
molly
listen
i
know
what
i
ll
do
tell
me
the
address
of
the
friends
who
live
nearest
here
and
i
will
go
and
fetch
them
i
will
bring
them
back
then
go
on
my
way
you
will
not
mind
being
left
for
a
short
time
will
you
no
said
miss
lydia
i
don
t
feel
i
dare
go
out
again
i
will
wait
here
you
are
so
good
to
me
i
do
hope
i
am
not
giving
you
too
much
by
this
time
molly
had
quite
made
up
her
mind
that
miss
lydia
was
sincere
no
doubt
of
her
sincerity
entered
molly
s
mind
until
happening
to
glance
out
of
the
window
she
saw
some
one
dodge
out
of
sight
behind
a
bush
in
the
one
with
a
red
scarf
bound
round
her
head
molly
s
knees
began
to
shake
what
could
this
mean
what
was
the
old
woman
with
the
horrible
eyes
doing
here
in
miss
lydia
s
garden
was
it
a
trap
she
looked
over
at
miss
lydia
who
was
sitting
patiently
where
molly
had
placed
her
molly
moved
softly
toward
the
window
and
stood
hidden
by
the
window
curtain
looking
out
in
a
few
seconds
she
saw
the
old
woman
s
hand
come
round
the
side
of
the
bush
and
make
a
signal
toward
the
hedge
by
the
fence
the
hedge
stirred
a
bit
so
there
was
some
one
else
hiding
there
thought
molly
she
turned
to
miss
lydia
the
sight
of
the
blind
woman
s
gentle
face
reassured
her
no
if
this
was
a
trap
miss
lydia
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
molly
felt
sure
of
that
anyway
she
decided
that
it
was
better
to
tell
miss
lydia
what
she
had
just
seen
in
the
garden
miss
lydia
was
terribly
agitated
at
first
and
cried
and
seemed
so
upset
that
she
made
molly
want
to
cry
too
but
we
must
be
brave
miss
lydia
said
molly
trust
me
and
do
what
i
tell
you
will
you
she
urged
we
must
help
each
other
all
we
can
i
will
help
you
with
my
eyes
and
you
must
help
me
with
your
and
tell
me
what
you
hear
and
you
can
help
me
by
telling
me
where
to
find
things
and
all
miss
lydia
calmed
down
gradually
and
promised
to
aid
molly
as
much
as
possible
molly
s
first
act
was
to
ascertain
that
all
the
windows
were
locked
and
the
front
and
back
doors
bolted
while
seeing
to
these
things
she
discovered
that
there
were
two
other
spies
lurking
in
the
back
garden
one
looked
something
like
the
figure
of
the
old
watchmaker
only
he
was
dressed
differently
the
other
man
she
had
not
seen
before
they
were
both
badly
concealed
among
some
tall
plants
and
ferns
why
are
all
the
spies
gathering
here
together
molly
asked
herself
do
they
know
i
ve
seen
them
i
wonder
they
don
t
mean
to
let
me
get
out
of
this
house
they
seem
to
be
watching
all
round
what
can
you
see
what
can
you
see
asked
miss
lydia
pleadingly
molly
told
her
i
don
t
think
they
can
hurt
long
as
we
keep
indoors
they
re
only
guarding
the
house
to
see
that
i
don
t
get
away
molly
broke
off
until
the
pumpkin
comes
was
what
she
had
been
going
to
say
but
there
was
no
need
to
set
miss
lydia
trembling
afresh
molly
herself
was
in
such
a
state
of
excitement
darting
noiselessly
from
one
window
to
another
comforting
miss
lydia
and
telling
her
what
she
could
see
that
there
was
hardly
time
to
be
very
frightened
miss
lydia
divided
her
attention
between
the
front
door
and
the
back
listening
anxiously
at
each
in
turn
presently
she
remembered
something
and
called
quietly
to
molly
there
is
a
little
room
at
the
very
top
of
the
house
in
the
roof
a
room
i
use
as
a
studio
she
said
if
you
go
up
you
will
have
a
better
view
of
the
garden
and
will
be
able
to
see
far
outside
the
garden
over
the
hedges
as
i
will
go
at
once
and
see
what
i
can
make
out
said
molly
but
i
saw
no
stairs
leading
up
any
they
are
in
the
cupboard
on
the
landing
was
miss
lydia
s
reply
i
ll
wait
here
by
the
front
molly
dashed
upstairs
found
the
cupboard
on
the
landing
and
opening
the
door
saw
the
concealed
stairs
she
ran
up
these
to
the
studio
there
were
four
windows
in
the
studio
one
on
each
side
of
the
room
she
looked
out
of
each
in
turn
taking
care
to
keep
well
back
in
the
room
so
as
to
be
out
of
sight
there
were
splendid
views
from
these
windows
she
could
see
clearly
now
the
old
woman
still
crouching
behind
the
bush
in
the
front
garden
she
could
see
too
who
was
behind
the
hedge
it
was
the
girl
in
green
who
had
met
them
in
the
third
green
lane
and
decoyed
them
to
the
old
woman
from
the
window
that
looked
out
on
to
the
back
garden
she
saw
the
other
two
spies
still
hiding
there
and
a
third
spy
hiding
a
little
farther
away
from
them
her
eyes
wandered
round
the
garden
then
all
at
once
she
gave
a
gasp
as
she
caught
sight
of
something
that
made
her
heart
seem
to
stop
beating
for
a
moment
then
start
to
hammer
madly
at
her
side
it
was
a
large
black
leaf
growing
in
the
garden
bed
just
behind
where
the
two
spies
were
hiding
so
that
from
the
lower
windows
they
had
hidden
it
completely
from
her
eyes
molly
could
scarcely
believe
it
for
a
moment
and
looked
again
to
make
sure
yes
it
was
the
black
leaf
at
last
she
understood
the
presence
of
the
spies
here
and
their
anxiety
to
keep
her
away
from
the
garden
which
contained
the
leaf
they
dared
not
touch
and
now
she
understood
the
reason
why
the
pumpkin
had
made
miss
lydia
blind
what
a
wonder
the
pumpkin
was
not
somewhere
near
to
guard
the
leaf
she
thought
and
even
as
she
thought
this
she
saw
the
pumpkin
he
came
rolling
slowly
along
the
garden
path
toward
the
back
door
oh
however
am
i
to
get
the
leaf
with
the
pumpkin
and
all
his
spies
around
thought
molly
then
she
heard
miss
lydia
s
voice
calling
up
the
stairs
come
quickly
hush
i
can
hear
that
rolling
sound
again
out
in
the
molly
ran
downstairs
oh
miss
lydia
miss
lydia
she
whispered
excitedly
do
you
know
why
they
re
all
round
this
house
spies
and
the
pumpkin
it
is
hush
miss
lydia
do
you
know
the
reason
the
black
leaf
is
growing
in
your
garden
i
can
see
it
from
your
studio
half
crying
half
laughing
molly
explained
rapidly
while
miss
lydia
wrung
her
hands
together
and
listened
intently
sh
she
interrupted
suddenly
listen
i
can
hear
the
rolling
sound
outside
the
front
door
the
back
not
both
at
once
queried
molly
yes
i
can
then
it
must
be
jack
as
there
are
two
pumpkins
cried
molly
tremulously
but
i
don
t
expect
he
can
help
us
she
went
on
quietly
he
s
under
the
power
of
the
pumpkin
entirely
he
ll
just
have
to
obey
molly
was
thinking
rapidly
what
was
she
to
do
how
could
she
reach
the
leaf
before
the
pumpkin
touched
her
every
moment
she
expected
to
hear
three
taps
on
one
of
the
doors
and
see
it
swing
open
and
the
pumpkin
roll
in
she
made
miss
lydia
sit
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
she
herself
stood
up
ready
to
run
if
necessary
what
was
she
to
do
so
far
the
pumpkin
had
made
no
attempt
to
enter
the
house
but
was
content
to
bide
his
time
outside
unfortunately
molly
did
not
know
which
door
he
was
waiting
at
nor
which
of
the
two
grey
pumpkins
outside
was
the
real
pumpkin
and
which
was
jack
how
could
she
reach
the
black
leaf
before
the
pumpkin
or
the
spies
could
stop
her
try
to
reach
it
she
must
yet
she
knew
if
she
stepped
outside
she
would
not
stand
a
moment
s
chance
on
the
other
hand
she
and
miss
lydia
might
remain
shut
up
in
this
house
for
ever
so
until
the
thirteen
days
were
up
and
the
leaf
had
disappeared
and
then
the
pumpkin
could
tap
on
the
door
and
enter
and
they
would
be
powerless
to
defend
themselves
if
only
something
would
happen
to
distract
the
watchers
outside
just
for
half
a
minute
that
would
be
time
could
reach
the
leaf
in
less
time
than
that
oh
how
tantalizingly
near
the
leaf
yet
how
far
away
presently
molly
asked
is
there
a
tree
in
your
garden
that
grows
anywhere
near
one
of
the
upstairs
windows
miss
lydia
i
didn
t
notice
when
i
ran
through
the
there
is
one
at
the
side
of
the
house
said
miss
lydia
it
can
be
reached
from
my
bedroom
branches
tap
against
the
why
what
do
you
want
to
know
about
the
tree
for
wait
a
moment
said
molly
i
ll
just
run
up
and
have
a
look
at
it
while
she
was
upstairs
she
had
another
look
out
of
the
studio
window
also
of
course
the
leaf
was
still
the
two
crouching
figures
among
the
tall
plants
molly
had
thought
out
her
plan
by
this
time
and
noticed
with
satisfaction
that
evening
was
rapidly
approaching
for
it
must
be
done
in
the
dusk
she
told
herself
just
before
the
moon
comes
she
went
down
to
miss
lydia
again
and
sat
beside
her
at
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
the
tree
will
do
splendidly
whispered
molly
then
she
told
her
companion
what
she
had
planned
to
do
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
if
you
will
miss
she
paused
i
m
going
to
ask
you
to
do
a
very
plucky
thing
in
half
an
hour
s
time
i
want
you
to
draw
the
bolts
of
the
back
door
and
walk
out
into
the
miss
lydia
was
startled
i
know
it
seems
a
dreadfully
hard
thing
to
ask
you
to
do
molly
went
on
hurriedly
but
i
believe
it
is
the
only
way
out
of
our
difficulties
for
the
sake
of
every
one
who
has
suffered
through
the
pumpkin
for
my
sake
for
your
own
sake
will
you
take
the
risk
miss
lydia
in
the
end
it
may
be
the
means
of
restoring
your
sight
you
they
talked
in
whispers
for
a
while
and
you
don
t
think
it
s
any
good
waiting
case
some
help
comes
asked
miss
lydia
wistfully
not
a
bit
of
good
i
m
afraid
said
molly
gently
it
s
very
unlikely
that
help
will
think
we
must
rely
only
on
then
i
won
t
fail
you
said
miss
lydia
they
sat
there
talking
occasionally
until
dusk
fell
then
molly
went
into
miss
lydia
s
bedroom
and
cautiously
opened
the
window
and
looked
out
there
appeared
to
be
no
one
watching
this
side
of
the
house
if
there
was
any
one
it
was
too
dark
to
see
them
and
so
they
would
not
be
able
to
see
her
molly
thought
she
had
strapped
her
little
pocket
satchel
firmly
across
her
shoulders
and
just
inside
where
she
could
easily
reach
it
was
old
nancy
s
box
of
matches
fortunately
there
was
a
slight
breeze
blowing
so
that
any
rustling
of
the
trees
unless
unusually
loud
would
not
attract
attention
molly
got
out
on
to
the
window
sill
and
from
there
climbed
as
noiselessly
as
possible
into
the
tree
molly
had
had
a
good
deal
of
experience
in
now
nevertheless
she
was
trembling
as
she
lowered
herself
down
to
the
branches
nearest
the
ground
it
was
not
a
nice
sensation
climbing
down
when
you
didn
t
know
what
was
at
the
bottom
she
waited
for
a
while
and
listened
peering
out
from
among
the
leaves
nothing
stirred
in
the
garden
below
as
far
as
she
could
make
out
she
had
but
to
drop
to
the
ground
run
round
the
corner
of
the
house
along
the
path
or
across
the
garden
bed
and
the
leaf
was
on
the
side
she
remembered
close
to
a
big
tree
whose
outline
could
be
dimly
seen
molly
waited
full
of
doubts
and
anxieties
after
all
was
this
a
wise
plan
to
try
was
it
too
simple
to
have
any
chance
of
success
what
a
long
time
miss
lydia
was
supposing
her
courage
failed
at
the
last
who
could
blame
her
it
was
such
an
easy
thing
for
miss
lydia
to
do
and
yet
such
a
hard
thing
the
pumpkin
was
almost
sure
to
catch
miss
it
would
only
be
a
momentary
triumph
molly
would
soon
see
that
things
were
put
right
is
if
the
pumpkin
did
not
catch
molly
too
but
molly
dared
not
think
about
that
she
was
strung
up
to
such
a
pitch
of
nervous
excitement
that
every
second
seemed
like
a
whole
minute
while
she
waited
how
brave
it
would
be
of
miss
lydia
if
she
what
a
long
time
she
was
could
anything
have
happened
to
her
perhaps
the
pumpkin
had
hark
what
was
that
it
was
the
sound
of
the
back
door
bolts
being
withdrawn
instantly
there
was
a
stir
in
the
garden
and
a
subdued
murmuring
floated
up
to
molly
s
ears
the
back
door
was
flung
open
noisily
and
footsteps
could
be
heard
on
the
path
molly
got
out
her
box
of
matches
the
garden
was
now
alive
with
whispering
figures
several
moved
quickly
toward
the
back
door
there
was
a
scuffle
a
scream
the
sound
of
footsteps
running
and
a
dull
thud
thud
then
the
sound
of
many
voices
calling
shouting
directions
raised
high
as
if
in
some
dispute
in
the
midst
of
all
this
molly
dropped
to
the
ground
and
ran
rapidly
round
the
corner
of
the
house
bounded
over
the
garden
bed
skirting
the
clump
of
plants
where
she
had
seen
the
two
spies
hiding
and
made
straight
for
the
big
tree
just
as
she
reached
the
spot
where
she
thought
the
black
leaf
was
she
felt
some
one
grab
hold
of
her
arm
and
she
was
jerked
back
here
she
is
here
she
is
that
s
not
her
at
the
back
door
here
she
is
ah
ha
screamed
a
voice
in
the
darkness
beside
her
the
voice
of
the
old
woman
with
the
horrible
eyes
who
had
evidently
run
to
guard
the
leaf
when
the
back
door
opened
quick
come
quick
here
she
is
i
ve
got
you
my
beauty
immediately
there
was
an
uproar
the
rush
of
many
feet
shouts
exclamations
came
from
every
direction
there
had
evidently
been
far
more
spies
hiding
in
the
garden
than
molly
had
known
quick
as
thought
she
struck
one
of
old
nancy
s
matches
and
as
the
light
spurted
out
of
the
darkness
she
flashed
the
flame
across
the
hands
that
were
gripping
her
arm
with
a
cry
of
pain
the
old
woman
loosened
her
grasp
and
molly
wriggled
and
darting
forward
clutched
at
the
stalk
of
the
black
plucked
it
holding
the
flaring
match
in
one
hand
high
above
her
head
and
clasping
the
black
leaf
firmly
in
the
other
hand
molly
called
out
in
a
clear
voice
the
words
old
nancy
had
told
her
come
to
me
grey
pumpkin
i
command
you
by
the
black
leaf
slowly
very
slowly
there
emerged
from
the
darkness
two
grey
pumpkins
as
they
rolled
toward
her
molly
glanced
hesitatingly
from
one
to
the
other
then
as
they
came
within
reach
she
stooped
and
hastily
touched
both
with
the
leaf
the
pumpkins
rocked
to
and
fro
for
a
second
then
became
still
at
her
feet
the
grey
pumpkin
was
conquered
at
last
molly
stood
silent
she
could
hardly
realize
that
it
was
true
after
a
while
she
became
aware
of
a
curious
stillness
in
the
garden
the
pumpkin
s
friends
had
quietly
crept
away
molly
looked
down
at
the
pumpkins
in
front
of
her
vaguely
disappointed
she
had
somehow
had
a
feeling
that
jack
would
be
restored
to
her
directly
she
had
found
the
black
leaf
the
two
grey
pumpkins
at
her
feet
looked
each
exactly
the
same
as
the
could
not
tell
which
was
the
real
grey
pumpkin
herself
this
then
was
the
pumpkin
s
object
in
turning
jack
into
a
likeness
of
himself
this
was
his
last
revenge
poor
molly
she
had
been
looking
forward
eagerly
to
seeing
jack
again
there
was
so
much
good
news
to
share
with
him
and
so
in
her
moment
of
triumph
molly
s
eyes
were
full
of
tears
i
can
t
understand
it
she
thought
i
expected
he
would
change
back
when
i
touched
him
with
the
black
leaf
i
must
take
them
both
back
to
old
nancy
she
ll
know
what
to
then
with
a
pang
of
remorse
she
remembered
miss
lydia
illustration
quick
as
thought
she
struck
one
of
old
nancy
s
matches
follow
me
said
molly
to
the
pumpkins
and
they
obeyed
her
it
was
strange
that
both
of
them
obeyed
the
holder
of
the
black
leaf
but
they
did
following
about
a
couple
of
yards
behind
her
at
the
door
of
the
cottage
she
found
miss
lydia
lying
on
the
ground
her
face
white
and
her
eyes
closed
molly
called
her
by
name
but
she
did
not
answer
it
was
growing
a
little
lighter
now
as
the
moon
was
beginning
to
appear
molly
groped
her
way
into
the
house
and
fetched
some
water
and
knelt
and
bathed
miss
lydia
s
forehead
calling
her
gently
from
time
to
time
it
was
a
curious
scene
in
the
dim
garden
molly
on
her
knees
beside
miss
lydia
the
black
leaf
tucked
into
the
strap
of
her
satchel
while
on
each
side
of
the
doorway
like
sentinels
were
two
motionless
grey
pumpkins
at
length
miss
lydia
stirred
and
gradually
recovered
presently
she
opened
her
eyes
then
gave
a
glad
cry
oh
i
can
see
i
can
see
she
said
oh
my
dear
and
she
cried
a
little
then
began
to
laugh
molly
told
her
quickly
what
had
happened
and
miss
lydia
was
overjoyed
at
beholding
the
black
leaf
in
molly
s
hand
and
the
pumpkin
waiting
for
commands
though
she
was
grieved
and
puzzled
that
molly
s
brother
had
not
yet
been
restored
she
herself
could
not
remember
anything
after
she
had
come
outside
into
the
garden
i
felt
something
bump
against
me
and
i
that
s
all
she
said
but
i
m
better
the
first
thing
i
must
do
said
molly
is
to
set
fire
to
the
nearest
beacon
they
are
marked
on
my
map
there
is
one
being
guarded
on
a
hill
close
half
an
hour
later
a
flame
sprang
out
of
the
night
on
the
top
of
a
hill
near
the
giant
s
head
spreading
rapidly
the
fire
darted
and
leapt
rising
higher
and
higher
until
it
became
a
great
mass
of
blazing
light
people
far
and
near
stopped
and
gazed
crying
excitedly
to
each
other
look
look
it
s
the
first
beacon
the
black
leaf
is
found
and
as
they
watched
an
answering
beacon
leapt
forth
from
a
neighbouring
height
hill
after
hill
took
up
the
glad
news
and
passed
it
on
until
the
beacons
blazing
throughout
the
kingdom
turned
night
into
day
chapter
xx
happened
outside
old
nancy
s
molly
had
struck
the
last
but
one
of
old
nancy
s
matches
in
order
to
set
light
to
the
beacon
and
now
she
and
miss
lydia
and
the
two
men
who
had
been
guarding
the
beacon
stood
on
the
hilltop
gazing
out
at
the
answering
light
on
the
neighbouring
hill
the
fire
cast
a
red
glow
over
them
all
and
over
the
silent
grey
pumpkins
in
their
midst
it
could
be
seen
that
the
guards
wore
curious
dark
red
boots
these
were
part
of
old
nancy
s
magic
protection
against
the
pumpkin
and
his
spies
as
also
was
the
white
circle
chalked
on
the
ground
around
the
fire
as
they
gazed
down
from
the
hill
one
of
the
guards
told
molly
the
quickest
way
back
to
the
east
gate
of
the
city
if
she
followed
the
high
road
which
was
dimly
visible
far
below
for
about
a
mile
she
would
come
to
a
lane
with
a
which
said
to
the
orange
go
to
the
bottom
of
this
lane
over
a
little
bridge
across
the
river
and
then
along
another
lane
which
skirted
the
wood
and
she
would
find
herself
in
the
village
at
the
edge
of
the
goblin
s
heath
back
over
the
heath
was
the
shortest
way
then
but
she
would
save
several
miles
by
going
along
the
high
road
at
first
molly
was
very
pleased
to
hear
of
this
short
cut
as
she
had
not
thought
of
looking
up
her
map
yet
and
so
being
very
anxious
to
reach
old
nancy
molly
and
miss
lydia
who
had
determined
to
return
with
her
said
to
the
guards
and
started
off
down
the
hillside
followed
by
the
two
pumpkins
as
they
went
along
molly
insisted
on
miss
lydia
who
looked
very
tired
and
exhausted
having
two
of
the
little
brown
square
sweets
that
old
nancy
had
given
her
and
she
ate
two
herself
after
a
few
minutes
both
she
and
miss
lydia
felt
much
refreshed
and
fit
for
the
journey
in
front
of
them
it
was
strange
and
delightful
to
molly
to
know
that
there
was
nothing
now
to
be
afraid
of
no
more
dodging
and
hiding
and
distrusting
everybody
when
they
neared
the
bottom
of
the
hill
they
caught
sight
of
a
figure
emerging
from
a
wood
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
high
road
the
person
stood
gazing
up
at
the
blazing
beacon
spellbound
then
all
at
once
gave
a
whoop
of
joy
and
did
a
sort
of
in
the
road
oh
cried
molly
delighted
it
glan
and
glan
it
was
sure
enough
he
raced
to
meet
them
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
little
party
moving
down
so
it
you
little
lady
you
ve
done
it
after
all
he
shouted
as
he
came
toward
them
well
done
well
done
and
he
seized
molly
s
hand
and
shook
it
till
he
nearly
shook
it
off
but
where
s
your
brother
he
asked
noting
with
puzzled
eyes
the
two
pumpkins
molly
told
him
what
had
happened
to
jack
as
they
all
moved
onward
to
the
high
road
and
then
she
went
on
to
explain
where
she
found
the
black
leaf
and
how
bravely
miss
lydia
had
acted
madam
i
m
proud
to
meet
you
said
glan
shaking
hands
with
miss
lydia
if
i
had
only
known
i
could
have
come
to
your
aid
i
was
not
so
far
away
finishing
searching
that
wood
which
is
my
boundary
you
remember
i
mentioned
that
part
of
my
joined
yours
he
turned
to
molly
but
of
course
i
knew
nothing
till
i
saw
that
blaze
in
the
sky
he
waved
his
hand
toward
the
beacon
you
re
not
worrying
about
your
brother
are
you
little
lady
he
inquired
peering
anxiously
at
molly
don
t
do
that
old
nancy
will
soon
put
things
right
i
feel
as
they
went
along
he
told
them
some
of
his
adventures
and
the
narrow
escapes
he
had
had
from
being
caught
by
the
spies
his
poor
old
father
had
been
nearly
caught
once
also
by
the
time
he
had
finished
they
were
well
on
the
way
back
along
the
high
road
it
seemed
to
molly
that
the
return
journey
developed
into
something
like
a
triumphal
procession
she
would
rather
have
gone
back
quietly
without
any
fuss
but
the
people
who
ran
out
to
meet
her
seemed
so
deeply
thankful
and
so
full
of
gratitude
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
wish
them
not
to
cheer
there
were
many
glances
of
awe
directed
at
the
two
pumpkins
as
they
rolled
steadily
along
side
by
side
many
of
the
people
followed
molly
and
miss
lydia
and
glan
all
the
way
back
to
the
straggling
crowd
that
grew
in
numbers
collecting
people
from
every
house
that
was
passed
on
the
road
presently
the
high
road
was
left
behind
and
they
took
the
short
cut
through
the
lane
that
went
near
the
orange
wood
here
molly
saw
farmer
and
mrs
rose
hurrying
to
join
them
and
she
had
to
explain
something
of
what
had
happened
as
they
walked
on
beside
her
they
went
through
the
village
and
all
the
people
turned
out
and
cheered
them
in
magnificent
style
and
miss
marigold
and
timothy
hastened
to
join
the
crowd
it
was
a
strange
crowd
made
up
of
all
sorts
of
people
little
and
big
old
and
young
that
flocked
round
the
little
girl
and
the
two
grey
pumpkins
that
followed
close
behind
her
the
people
s
awe
of
the
pumpkin
was
not
easily
overcome
and
they
kept
a
respectful
distance
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
little
girl
held
in
her
hand
the
black
leaf
out
over
the
goblin
s
heath
they
all
trooped
there
were
rustlings
in
the
bushes
here
and
darting
little
figures
that
scampered
across
their
path
which
made
glan
laugh
hilariously
from
the
goblin
s
heath
they
could
see
the
beacons
blazing
on
the
hills
for
miles
round
when
they
entered
the
second
green
lane
they
saw
a
figure
bustling
along
in
front
of
them
that
molly
recognized
at
once
it
was
mr
papingay
on
his
way
to
the
city
he
seemed
glad
to
see
molly
again
and
inquired
immediately
about
his
black
leaf
i
haven
t
shown
it
yet
but
i
m
going
to
said
molly
i
ve
kept
it
carefully
think
what
all
these
people
will
say
when
they
see
we
reach
the
city
at
which
he
beamed
and
seemed
content
glan
greeted
him
heartily
slapping
him
on
the
back
and
calling
him
uncle
and
they
walked
on
together
arm
in
arm
both
of
them
talking
unceasingly
whether
either
of
them
listened
to
a
word
the
other
said
is
more
than
any
one
can
say
when
they
reached
the
high
road
again
they
could
hear
all
the
bells
in
the
city
ringing
and
people
were
watching
anxiously
from
the
top
of
the
city
walls
here
they
are
here
they
are
cried
somebody
and
then
such
a
cheer
went
up
that
the
sound
of
the
bells
was
drowned
altogether
for
a
few
moments
to
molly
the
return
journey
had
seemed
very
short
partly
because
of
the
short
cuts
they
had
taken
and
partly
because
they
had
been
able
to
keep
straight
ahead
as
there
was
now
no
searching
or
dodging
to
delay
them
but
altogether
they
had
travelled
many
miles
and
had
been
several
hours
on
the
journey
and
the
night
was
now
far
advanced
it
was
a
perfect
night
warm
and
still
and
clear
for
the
moon
sailed
overhead
flooding
the
land
with
its
beautiful
white
light
many
of
the
citizens
had
already
gone
out
on
to
the
hill
by
the
west
gate
in
readiness
to
see
them
pass
down
to
old
nancy
s
those
that
were
left
joined
in
the
procession
at
the
rear
on
passing
glan
s
shop
they
found
that
his
father
and
aunt
janet
had
already
gone
ahead
as
they
did
not
know
which
way
the
procession
was
coming
and
they
wanted
a
front
seat
glan
said
outside
the
west
gate
the
king
was
waiting
and
he
put
his
hands
on
molly
s
shoulders
and
thanked
her
very
sincerely
in
the
name
of
the
country
then
he
walked
with
her
down
the
hill
and
she
told
him
about
jack
the
hill
was
packed
with
people
eager
murmuring
straining
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
molly
and
the
pumpkins
as
she
drew
near
old
nancy
s
cottage
molly
saw
that
a
wide
space
had
been
cleared
around
the
cottage
by
the
city
guards
and
there
was
old
nancy
standing
waiting
by
her
door
the
firelight
flickering
in
the
room
behind
her
just
as
she
had
stood
when
molly
had
last
seen
her
she
held
out
her
hands
to
molly
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
little
girl
the
king
gently
urged
molly
forward
and
so
she
stepped
out
alone
into
the
open
space
and
went
toward
old
nancy
the
two
pumpkins
following
obediently
then
a
strange
hush
fell
over
the
huge
crowd
gathered
on
the
hill
and
every
one
waited
expectantly
for
what
was
about
to
happen
here
is
the
black
leaf
said
molly
handing
the
leaf
to
old
nancy
and
here
is
the
grey
old
nancy
stooped
and
kissed
molly
on
the
forehead
my
dear
how
can
i
thank
you
she
said
but
tell
me
how
this
happened
and
she
motioned
toward
the
two
pumpkins
molly
explained
the
people
around
could
not
hear
what
molly
said
but
the
whisper
ran
from
one
to
the
other
that
one
of
the
pumpkins
was
the
little
girl
s
brother
who
was
under
a
spell
oh
will
you
bring
jack
back
again
begged
molly
anxiously
old
nancy
looked
gravely
at
each
of
the
pumpkins
in
turn
which
jack
she
muttered
to
herself
then
she
peered
out
her
hand
and
turning
each
of
the
pumpkins
over
and
round
about
the
crowd
gasped
when
she
first
touched
the
pumpkins
it
was
difficult
to
get
used
to
the
idea
that
the
pumpkin
was
harmless
now
a
pin
was
stuck
in
the
pumpkin
pincushion
she
said
to
herself
let
me
see
now
let
me
see
now
ah
then
one
is
the
grey
pumpkin
cried
old
nancy
triumphantly
for
there
is
a
big
pin
stuck
through
the
top
of
him
a
great
cheer
went
up
from
the
crowd
though
those
at
the
back
did
not
know
what
they
were
cheering
about
old
nancy
touched
the
grey
pumpkin
three
times
with
the
black
leaf
the
pumpkin
trembled
rocked
then
was
still
the
grey
pumpkin
is
now
completely
in
my
power
said
old
nancy
but
before
we
punish
him
let
us
make
sure
that
he
has
remedied
all
the
mischief
he
has
done
most
of
you
who
have
suffered
through
him
probably
found
that
you
were
suddenly
released
from
the
spells
which
had
held
soon
as
the
black
leaf
was
plucked
is
that
correct
murmurs
of
assent
came
from
the
crowd
old
nancy
asked
any
who
were
still
suffering
from
spells
put
on
them
by
the
pumpkin
to
step
forward
and
waited
but
no
one
stepped
forward
molly
looked
across
at
miss
lydia
and
smiled
then
there
is
only
this
one
last
case
to
old
nancy
pointed
to
one
of
the
grey
pumpkins
this
spell
was
different
from
the
others
because
it
was
worked
upon
a
person
from
the
impossible
she
hesitated
looking
down
at
the
pumpkin
which
was
supposed
to
contain
jack
molly
saw
some
one
signalling
wildly
to
her
from
the
crowd
it
was
mr
papingay
don
t
forget
he
called
to
molly
in
a
loud
aside
now
s
the
time
molly
remembered
her
promise
and
opening
her
little
satchel
rummaged
about
inside
then
took
out
mr
papingay
s
painted
black
leaf
and
unfolded
it
what
is
that
asked
old
nancy
it
is
a
black
leaf
which
mr
papingay
painted
and
which
i
promised
to
show
everybody
and
he
wants
me
to
do
it
now
said
molly
holding
it
out
a
flicker
of
a
smile
showed
at
the
corners
of
old
nancy
s
mouth
but
she
sternly
repressed
it
she
took
the
painted
leaf
and
gazed
at
it
for
a
moment
then
muttered
something
in
an
undertone
and
made
a
sign
across
the
leaf
with
her
left
hand
holding
the
real
black
leaf
and
the
painted
leaf
together
in
her
right
have
you
any
of
the
matches
left
that
i
gave
you
she
asked
molly
one
molly
replied
that
s
just
old
nancy
held
the
painted
leaf
high
in
the
air
i
want
you
all
to
see
this
leaf
which
has
been
made
and
painted
by
mr
papingay
and
is
an
exact
copy
of
the
black
leaf
it
is
a
clever
piece
of
you
shall
see
mr
papingay
have
i
your
permission
to
do
anything
i
like
with
this
certainly
ma
you
like
beamed
mr
papingay
swelling
with
pride
at
his
own
and
the
leaf
s
importance
old
nancy
handed
the
painted
leaf
back
to
molly
place
it
under
that
grey
pumpkin
she
said
pointing
to
jack
s
pumpkin
when
molly
had
done
this
she
was
told
to
strike
her
one
remaining
match
and
set
light
to
the
painted
leaf
this
she
did
and
stood
back
as
it
caught
alight
and
little
tongues
of
fire
and
grey
puffs
of
smoke
curled
round
the
pumpkin
higher
the
smoke
curled
and
thicker
it
became
until
the
pumpkin
was
entirely
hidden
from
view
in
the
centre
of
a
great
column
of
grey
smoke
every
one
suddenly
there
was
a
terrific
the
smoke
began
to
thin
and
drift
apart
as
it
cleared
away
a
figure
could
be
seen
standing
in
the
centre
of
it
it
was
jack
dazed
and
rubbing
his
eyes
jack
jack
cried
molly
rushing
toward
him
oh
i
am
so
glad
are
you
quite
all
right
jack
are
you
hurt
she
drew
him
out
of
the
smoke
hullo
he
said
gazing
round
oh
i
say
what
s
happened
he
was
soon
told
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
i
ve
been
stowed
away
in
an
old
pumpkin
and
been
rolling
about
all
over
the
country
i
must
have
looked
an
ass
said
jack
but
i
don
t
remember
feel
as
if
i
ve
been
shut
up
somewhere
and
been
to
he
found
his
hand
seized
by
one
friend
after
another
and
himself
congratulated
and
questioned
by
the
crowd
that
gathered
round
him
and
so
it
was
your
leaf
that
did
the
trick
mr
papingay
was
it
said
jack
grasping
that
gentleman
s
hand
and
pumping
it
up
and
down
well
i
m
are
a
marvellous
man
which
was
just
what
mr
papingay
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
was
thinking
about
himself
chapter
xxi
grey
pumpkin
s
and
now
the
smoke
having
entirely
disappeared
old
nancy
turned
again
toward
the
grey
pumpkin
she
raised
the
black
leaf
high
over
her
head
and
closing
her
eyes
murmured
something
to
herself
then
she
opened
her
eyes
and
said
to
molly
i
have
summoned
the
pumpkin
s
spies
but
while
we
are
waiting
for
them
i
want
you
to
tell
us
the
story
of
how
you
found
the
black
molly
felt
very
shy
all
at
once
but
she
obeyed
old
nancy
and
standing
on
the
doorstep
facing
the
crowd
she
told
her
story
as
briefly
as
she
could
without
leaving
out
the
name
of
anybody
who
had
helped
one
of
the
councillors
was
asked
by
the
king
to
take
down
her
words
in
a
so
that
they
could
be
afterward
read
by
all
those
at
a
distance
who
could
not
hear
when
molly
came
to
the
part
about
miss
lydia
she
forgot
her
shyness
and
grew
enthusiastic
i
could
never
have
got
the
black
leaf
at
the
end
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
miss
lydia
she
cried
she
was
awfully
brave
although
she
had
been
made
blind
by
the
pumpkin
she
walked
out
into
the
garden
where
the
leaf
was
growing
and
where
the
pumpkin
and
his
spies
were
went
out
distract
i
got
the
three
cheers
for
miss
lydia
cried
someone
in
the
crowd
and
the
cheers
were
given
heartily
much
to
miss
lydia
s
confusion
when
molly
reached
the
end
of
her
tale
there
was
a
perfect
storm
of
cheering
she
stepped
down
flushed
and
excited
and
stood
talking
to
old
nancy
for
a
few
minutes
until
the
cheering
gradually
died
away
and
in
its
place
a
low
muttering
and
groaning
arose
at
the
back
of
the
crowd
followed
by
an
outburst
of
booing
and
hissing
molly
turned
quickly
and
saw
that
the
crowd
had
parted
and
through
the
space
made
a
procession
of
people
was
wending
its
way
they
were
the
pumpkin
s
spies
some
very
dejected
with
hanging
heads
others
sullen
and
defiant
first
came
the
old
woman
with
the
scarlet
turban
and
the
little
darting
eyes
next
came
the
girl
in
green
then
several
others
that
molly
had
never
seen
judging
by
the
remarks
to
be
heard
on
all
sides
they
were
no
strangers
to
the
other
searchers
among
those
in
the
rear
molly
recognized
the
old
watchmaker
and
the
man
on
horseback
who
had
given
her
the
letter
that
was
supposed
to
be
from
old
nancy
there
were
about
thirty
of
the
spies
altogether
and
they
gathered
in
a
group
before
old
nancy
who
eyed
them
sadly
was
it
you
who
scattered
the
grey
powder
on
my
window
sill
and
made
me
sleep
through
the
sunset
hour
and
so
enabled
the
pumpkin
to
return
she
asked
of
the
old
woman
who
had
led
the
band
of
spies
the
old
woman
nodded
when
some
one
in
the
impossible
world
pierced
the
pumpkin
with
a
pin
the
power
for
good
which
held
me
was
suddenly
dispersed
and
all
the
evil
magic
that
i
knew
rushed
into
my
mind
and
i
made
the
grey
powder
and
brought
it
to
you
heh
heh
heh
a
chuckle
escaped
and
i
m
glad
i
did
we
ve
had
a
splendid
time
ain
t
we
ducky
she
leered
at
the
girl
in
green
who
nodded
sullenly
and
if
it
hadn
t
bin
for
a
sort
of
muddle
we
made
between
us
in
our
eagerness
to
keep
that
meddlin
gel
away
old
woman
gave
molly
an
ugly
our
grey
pumpkin
wouldn
t
have
bin
caught
and
here
that
he
wouldn
tell
me
about
the
muddle
said
old
nancy
swaying
the
black
leaf
in
her
hand
gently
toward
the
old
woman
who
seemed
compelled
to
answer
in
the
first
place
one
of
us
led
her
jerked
her
head
in
the
direction
of
miss
to
the
wrong
lake
by
mistake
when
she
was
into
that
gel
s
path
instead
of
out
of
it
and
when
we
found
out
what
had
bin
done
and
went
to
fetch
her
away
from
lake
desolate
we
couldn
t
find
her
so
in
case
she
came
back
to
the
lake
which
she
did
another
of
us
thinking
to
cover
up
the
mistake
wrote
a
letter
making
believe
it
was
from
you
old
nancy
and
the
gel
would
have
believed
the
letter
and
obeyed
it
and
everything
would
have
bin
all
right
for
us
only
something
put
it
into
her
head
not
to
believe
the
letter
and
so
she
led
the
blind
woman
home
and
found
the
leaf
growing
in
her
garden
but
even
then
she
would
never
have
got
the
leaf
if
it
hadn
t
bin
for
those
matches
of
yours
old
nancy
they
do
burn
and
the
old
woman
held
out
her
right
hand
across
the
back
of
which
was
a
deep
red
scar
what
put
it
into
your
head
not
to
believe
that
letter
she
asked
suddenly
of
molly
i
had
seen
miss
lydia
s
photo
at
a
friend
s
house
and
i
recognized
her
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
beside
lake
so
i
trusted
her
molly
answered
so
that
s
how
it
was
nodded
the
old
woman
of
course
we
sent
for
the
pumpkin
at
once
as
soon
as
we
found
you
were
on
your
way
to
the
house
but
he
did
not
arrive
until
you
were
inside
so
we
thought
we
d
catch
you
coming
are
none
of
you
repentant
asked
old
nancy
none
of
you
sorry
for
all
the
unhappiness
you
have
caused
repentant
i
should
think
not
the
old
woman
answered
no
though
we
re
powerless
re
not
repentant
we
had
the
finest
time
of
our
lives
that
s
so
comrades
ain
t
it
the
other
spies
assented
without
hesitation
then
said
old
nancy
it
would
be
best
to
banish
you
all
together
with
your
leader
the
grey
pumpkin
out
of
our
world
into
the
impossible
world
where
you
can
do
no
harm
is
it
your
wish
that
i
do
this
old
nancy
cried
to
the
crowd
yes
yes
banish
them
banish
them
the
answer
came
from
hundreds
of
voices
and
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
deafening
roar
from
the
people
but
as
old
nancy
lifted
her
hand
the
noise
died
away
and
there
was
silence
again
old
nancy
moved
among
the
spies
touching
each
with
the
black
leaf
and
muttering
some
words
to
herself
they
shivered
as
the
leaf
touched
them
you
shall
retain
your
human
forms
in
the
impossible
world
said
old
nancy
to
the
spies
but
all
the
evil
magic
you
have
learned
you
shall
forget
you
will
forget
too
your
life
in
this
world
sometimes
you
will
have
vague
recollections
but
you
will
never
be
able
to
find
your
way
back
here
again
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
any
harm
to
others
in
the
impossible
world
i
am
allowing
you
to
retain
your
human
forms
because
bad
as
you
have
been
you
have
not
been
as
bad
as
the
grey
pumpkin
according
to
your
wicked
acts
in
this
land
so
will
your
unhappiness
be
in
the
impossible
world
will
be
very
unhappy
she
ended
pointing
to
the
old
woman
then
muttering
some
strange
words
old
nancy
waved
the
leaf
again
and
the
spies
moved
slowly
away
toward
the
great
tree
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
high
road
knock
three
times
commanded
old
nancy
and
the
old
woman
with
a
last
defiant
toss
of
the
head
knocked
three
times
the
door
in
the
tree
swung
open
and
one
after
the
other
the
spies
passed
through
and
the
door
closed
after
them
with
a
thud
all
this
time
the
grey
pumpkin
had
remained
motionless
in
front
of
the
cottage
door
and
now
old
nancy
approached
him
and
touching
him
once
more
with
the
black
leaf
said
go
back
to
the
impossible
world
not
as
a
pincushion
this
time
though
you
shall
still
retain
your
hated
shape
and
shall
not
resume
your
human
form
again
you
shall
become
a
footstool
for
people
to
kick
about
and
rest
their
feet
shall
become
a
hassock
go
and
never
never
slowly
the
grey
pumpkin
swayed
from
side
to
side
then
rolled
away
across
the
road
to
the
tree
it
knocked
three
times
against
the
tree
the
door
opened
and
the
grey
pumpkin
passed
out
into
the
impossible
world
the
silence
which
followed
the
closing
of
the
door
in
the
tree
was
broken
by
a
terrible
guffaw
of
laughter
from
glan
s
father
at
once
a
wild
outburst
of
cheers
and
laughter
and
shouting
came
from
the
crowd
on
the
hill
cheers
for
old
nancy
cheers
for
the
king
cheers
for
molly
and
jack
cheers
for
the
other
searchers
there
seemed
no
end
to
the
cheering
for
the
people
were
mad
with
delight
but
through
it
all
glan
s
father
laughed
on
until
the
tears
rolled
down
his
cheeks
and
aunt
janet
grew
flustered
and
alarmed
but
glan
only
stood
in
front
of
his
father
his
arms
akimbo
and
laughed
too
that
s
right
father
he
cried
go
on
go
on
let
him
be
aunt
janet
he
s
not
had
a
laugh
for
years
and
meanwhile
jack
and
molly
were
making
preparations
for
returning
home
through
the
tree
molly
handed
the
satchels
back
to
old
nancy
and
although
both
the
children
were
sorry
to
leave
their
friends
they
felt
that
now
their
work
was
finished
they
would
like
to
return
home
it
was
a
long
time
since
they
had
seen
mother
and
father
and
so
they
began
to
say
to
the
little
group
of
friends
around
them
including
mrs
jennet
who
had
arrived
with
mr
exactly
like
time
to
witness
the
exit
of
the
pumpkin
the
king
and
old
nancy
had
been
talking
apart
from
the
crowd
and
now
they
turned
to
jack
and
molly
will
you
accept
this
said
the
king
to
molly
handing
her
a
little
box
as
a
small
token
of
our
thanks
and
appreciation
of
the
service
you
have
done
this
country
it
seems
a
very
insignificant
thing
to
offer
you
but
it
has
an
unusual
gift
attached
to
it
whenever
you
wear
it
you
will
be
happy
and
will
give
happiness
to
those
around
you
do
not
open
the
box
now
but
place
it
on
your
table
when
you
get
home
where
the
pincushion
stood
and
when
the
sunshine
falls
across
it
if
you
open
it
before

the
little
box
and
thanked
the
king
sincerely
with
sparkling
eyes
to
jack
the
king

mysterious
smiles

majesty
but

t
feel
as

said
jack
but
the
king
shook
him
warmly
by
the
hand
and
said
he
had
done
a
great
deal
to
help
and
so
they
bade
the
king
you
will
find
that
your
mother
hasn
t
been
anxious
about
saw
to
that
said
old
nancy
as
they

to

and
glan
said

again
some
day
little
lady
you
and
your
brother
do
won
t
you
knock
three
times
on
the
tree
when
the
moon
is
full
oh
we
d
love
to
come
again
some
day
wouldn
t
we
jack
said
molly
rather
said
jack
so
for
the
third
time
that
night
the
door
in
the
tree
opened
in
response
to
the
three
knocks
and
this
time
a
little
girl
and
boy
passed
through
to
the
impossible
world
again
chapter
xxii
impossible
world
when
jack
and
molly
reached
the
fence
that
separated
their
garden
from
the
wood
jack
was
surprised
to
find
his
slipper
still
lying
slipper
he
had
lost
on
the
way
out
oh
i
say
moll
he
said
look
forgot
to
give
old
nancy
her
slipper
back
and
now
i
ve
got
three
slippers
all
alike
which
was
in
truth
the
case
as
they
crossed
the
garden
they
noticed
that
day
was
just
dawning
they
found
the
back
door
locked
but
jack
scrambled
through
the
scullery
window
which
was
unfastened
and
so
let
molly
in
without
disturbing
anybody
they
crept
upstairs
and
managed
to
get
an
hour
s
rest
before
the
breakfast
bell
rang
molly
remembered
to
place
her
little
box
on
the
before
she
went
to
sleep
and
when
she
woke
she
saw
that
the
sun
was
streaming
right
across
it
so
she
sprang
up
eagerly
and
opened
the
box
inside
was
the
most
exquisite
silver
bangle
that
she
had
ever
seen
molly
was
delighted
and
she
found
afterward
that
it
had
indeed
some
special
charm
about
it
for
she
was
always
happy
when
wearing
it
and
those
around
her
seemed
the
same
at
the
mother
and
father
seemed
to
the
children
to
glance
at
them
rather
curiously
mother
began
molly
do
you
know
who
gave
me
this
and
she
showed
her
the
silver
bracelet
yes
said
mother
to
molly
s
surprise
i
know
all
about
why
how
did
you
asked
jack
but
ah
was
all
mother
would
say
and
she
and
father
exchanged
amused
glances
it
was
a
little
puzzling
and
even
when
there
arrived
by
post
for
jack
a
long
narrow
box
containing
three
mother
and
father
never
asked
whom
they
were
from
although
there
was
no
name
inside
i
suppose
there
s
no
need
for
us
to
tell
you
all
about
our
adventure
if
you
know
already
remarked
jack
do
you
know
everything
everything
replied
mother
smiling
of
course
the
grey
pumpkin
pincushion
had
entirely
vanished
from
molly
s
and
she
never
set
eyes
on
it
again
though
she
wrote
and
thanked
aunt
phœbe
for
her
useful
jack
and
molly
often
wonder
where
the
grey
pumpkin
and
his
spies
are
they
have
never
seen
any
of
them
yet
though
molly
has
seen
a
who
reminds
her
somewhat
of
the
old
watchmaker
both
children
keep
a
watchful
eye
on
all
shops
that
sell
hassocks
and
always
glance
eagerly
round
the
room
when
they
are
invited
out
to
tea
anywhere
but
so
far
they
have
not
come
across
the
grey
pumpkin
