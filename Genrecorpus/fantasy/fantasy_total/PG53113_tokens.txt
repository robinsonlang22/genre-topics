introduction
these
myths
and
tales
are
the
free
translations
of
texts
recorded
in
the
dialect
of
the
white
mountain
apache
the
texts
themselves
with
word
for
word
translations
follow
as
part
iv
of
the
volume
they
were
recorded
with
one
exception
during
the
winter
of
as
a
part
of
the
studies
made
in
the
southwest
under
the
yearly
grant
of
archer
huntington
the
creation
myth
secured
from
noze
differs
in
important
incidents
from
the
versions
given
above
from
the
san
carlos
as
well
as
from
versions
secured
from
other
white
mountain
apache
it
should
not
be
assumed
that
these
differences
are
tribal
it
is
more
probable
that
they
are
individual
since
forms
from
the
san
carlos
and
navajo
are
closely
similar
to
each
other
the
greater
number
of
the
remaining
narratives
were
secured
from
the
father
of
frank
crockett
the
interpreter
employed
several
of
these
are
ceremonial
and
religious
in
their
character
and
probably
would
not
have
been
given
except
for
the
son
influence
two
of
these
were
later
secured
from
san
carlos
informants
in
more
extended
form
but
highly
corroborative
in
their
general
agreement
the
main
purpose
in
recording
these
narratives
was
to
secure
sufficient
and
varied
connected
texts
in
the
dialect
of
the
white
mountain
apache
as
a
collection
of
mythology
and
folklore
it
is
probably
far
from
complete
it
is
assumed
however
to
be
fairly
representative

make
them
like

beings
who
are
the
kin
of
the
woman
whose
children

going
about
among

a
long
way
off

enough
to
run
about
and
were
becoming
intelligent
they
asked
their
mother
where
their
father
was
living
why
do
you
ask
she
said
you
can
not
go
to
why
do
you
say
that
why
do
you
hide
our
father
from
us

boys
asked

want
to
go
where

asked

you
suppose

are
asking
the
boys
replied
we
will
go
where
our
father
their
mother
told
them
that
they
were
talking
foolishly
that
the
distance
was
great
and
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
go
the
boys
insisted
but
were
again
discouraged
by
their
mother
they
finally
said
that
it
must
be
they
had
no
father
if
they
could
not
go
to
him
the
mother
then
consented
and
said
they
three
would
go
to
the
top
of
a
great
mountain
she
cut
a
supply
of
meat
and
after
four
days
when
it
was
near
dawn
they
started
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
mountain
when
it
was
day
and
stood
there
facing
the
sun
the
woman
stood
between
the
boys
holding
them
by
the
hand
when
the
sun
was
rising
she
said
look
your
father
is
rising
observe
well
his
breath
streams
out
from
four
sides
go
towards
the
streaming
out
of
his
breath
there
are
dangerous
things
living
in
the
east
what
have
you
to
go
with
she
had
a
brown
fly
and
she
gave
it
to
the
boys
that
it
might
sit
by
their
ears
the
fly
was
to
show
them
the
way
and
tell
them
where
the
dangerous
ones
lived
she
told
them
they
were
to
start
at
midday
they
remained
there
until
the
sun
reached
the
sky
hole
they
then
went
four
times
around
the
trees
on
top
of
the
mountain
the
woman
started
home
and
the
boys
set
out
on
their
journey
the
boys
went
toward
the
east
but
the
sun
was
going
in
the
opposite
direction
the
boys
sat
down
and
cried
a
raven
spreading
out
his
wings
alighted
nearby
and
asked
the
boys
why
they
were
crying
the
boys
replied
that
their
father
lived
over
there
and
that
they
were
going
to
visit
him
the
raven
asked
if
they
were
carrying
anything
in
the
way
of
food
with
them
they
replied
that
they
had
some
meat
the
raven
said
they
might
ride
on
his
back
if
they
would
give
him
some
of
the
meat
the
fly
told
them
it
would
be
all
right
to
ride
on
the
raven
that
the
raven
could
see
half
the
way
and
that
there
someone
was
living
who
knew
the
remainder
of
the
way
they
were
told
by
the
raven
to
break
up
the
meat
and
put
the
pieces
in
his
mouth
that
two
of
the
parcels
would
sustain
him
until
he
finished
the
journey
as
far
as
he
knew
the
way
they
were
directed
to
get
on
the
raven
back
the
raven
began
by
flying
near
the
ground
then
went
higher
and
higher
circling
around
a
hot
rain
fell
but
the
raven
covered
them
with
his
wings
they
kept
putting
the
meat
into
the
raven
mouth
when
they
had
fed
the
raven
two
pieces
of
the
meat
they
passed
through
a
cloud
where
the
large
eagle
lived
the
raven
told
them
that
that
one
the
eagle
would
now
take
them
that
he
knew
all
the
places
because
he
saw
everything
upon
the
earth
that
he
himself
would
go
back
the
eagle
asked
them
where
they
were
going
saying
that
he
lived
in
a
dangerous
place
the
boys
indicated
the
direction
they
were
going
saying
they
had
been
told
their
father
lived
there
eagle
said
it
was
true
their
father
lived
at
that
place
and
asked
if
they
had
heard
about
his
house
the
boys
replied
that
their
mother
had
told
them
that
the
sun
was
their
father
and
that
he
lived
over
there
because
she
had
told
them
this
they
were
on
their
way
to
see
him
eagle
asked
them
by
what
means
they
intended
to
go
saying
even
he
was
in
danger
from
the
sun
the
fly
staying
by
the
ear
of
one
of
the
boys
flew
away
and
soon
returned
with
the
statement
that
the
dangerous
places
did
exist
and
that
eagle
with
whom
they
were
sitting
was
the
one
who
knew
and
was
in
control
of
these
dangerous
places
before
the
house
of
the
sun
was
ice
interlocked
like
fallen
timber
eagle
addressed
the
boys
asking
if
they
had
with
them
anything
from
the
earth
meaning
meat
they
replied
that
they
had
and
each
of
the
boys
took
some
from
his
pocket
eagle
asked
for
some
of
it
which
when
it
was
given
him
he
ate
eagle
then
said
they
would
set
out
for
he
knew
the
trail
he
requested
them
to
put
meat
in
his
mouth
as
he
flew
with
them
indicating
the
amount
which
would
be
sufficient
for
the
trail
when
they
were
seated
on
the
eagle
he
started
down
with
them
circling
around
as
he
flew
a
storm
of
hail
fell
on
them
the
hailstones
being
large
with
points
the
eagle
protected
the
boys
by
covering
them
with
his
wings
which
were
rolled
back
over
them
when
they
had
passed
through
the
storm
eagle
asked
that
meat
be
put
in
his
mouth
when
he
had
been
fed
he
flew
away
with
the
boys
and
went
through
a
hole
which
was
there
for
him
when
he
came
to
the
trail
he
alighted
and
pointing
out
the
path
told
them
that
it
led
to
the
house
of
the
sun
he
said
that
he
himself
would
now
turn
back
home
the
boys
went
forward
until
they
crossed
a
shallow
valley
beyond
which
was
the
house
which
had
projections
running
out
in
four
directions
when
they
walked
with
their
eyes
closed
the
house
went
out
of
sight
but
when
they
opened
their
eyes
the
house
settled
down
again
it
did
this
four
times
and
then
it
stood
firmly
the
two
boys
walked
on
and
coming
to
the
house
stood
in
front
of
the
entrance
an
old
woman
who
was
the
wife
of
the
sun
sat
there
she
advised
them
to
go
on
wherever
they
were
intending
to
go
since
a
person
of
mean
disposition
was
soon
to
arrive
the
woman
who
spoke
to
them
was
really
handsome
but
she
sat
there
in
the
form
of
an
old
woman
the
boys
replied
that
they
had
been
told
that
their
father
lived
there
and
that
they
had
started
to
come
that
morning
the
woman
replied
that
she
did
not
know
who
their
father
was
the
boys
said
that
the
sun
was
their
father
and
they
had
come
to
visit
him
the
woman
then
asked
who
had
told
them
that
the
sun
was
their
father
they
said
their
mother
had
told
them
so
the
woman
told
them
that
their
father
would
soon
return
and
asked
them
to
be
seated
on
a
chair
she
indicated
when
they
were
seated
the
chair
kept
whirling
around
with
them
when
the
chair
would
lift
up
the
woman
would
make
it
come
down
again
when
the
woman
saw
the
chair
come
down
again
she
announced
herself
as
nearly
convinced
they
had
spoken
the
truth
saying
that
the
sun
was
now
coming
close
she
took
four
silk
blankets
of
different
colors
which
had
been
sewed
together
projecting
in
four
directions
and
rolled
the
boys
up
in
them
she
put
them
into
an
inside
room
they
heard
the
sun
come
back
and
heard
him
speak
old
woman
where
are
the
two
men
who
came
here
he
asked
the
woman
replied
i
have
not
seen
anyone
no
one
has
been
you
say
there
is
no
one
they
must
have
come
for
here
are
their
tracks
the
sun
replied
you
must
have
been
cohabiting
with
someone
else
you
say
you
travel
over
this
broad
earth
and
that
you
do
not
visit
anyone
you
must
have
been
deceiving
me
about
it
for
two
men
came
in
from
that
trail
saying
they
are
your
children
his
wife
said
the
sun
asked
that
they
be
brought
in
and
the
woman
opened
the
door
brought
in
the
roll
of
blankets
and
threw
it
down
the
sun
shook
the
blankets
and
two
men
stood
up
the
sun
spoke
hesh
do
you
consider
these
to
be
my
children
they
do
not
look
like
he
stood
by
them
and
repeated
his
question
calling
attention
to
their
webbed
hands
and
feet
and
their
round
ears
are
you
really
my
children
he
asked
them
who
is
called
the
sun
i
wonder
the
youngest
of
the
boys
said
and
water
fell
from
his
eyes
well
maybe
you
are
my
children
sit
here
and
wait
the
sun
said
their
fly
looked
around
and
reported
that
the
man
was
their
father
after
examining
the
room
everywhere
the
inner
corners
the
windows
and
door
the
fly
told
them
that
ordeals
were
being
prepared
for
them
he
said
that
soon
a
blazing
sky
would
be
arranged
into
which
they
would
be
thrown
the
fly
looked
around
for
downy
feathers
which
he
gave
the
boys
when
the
sun
had
finished
eating
he
asked
that
those
who
said
they
were
the
sun
children
should
be
brought
in
he
threw
them
into
the
place
of
danger
he
pushed
them
in
with
lightning
which
had
sharp
spines
they
turned
into
downy
feathers
and
stood
in
front
of
him
again
it
is
true
the
sun
said
he
threw
them
in
four
times
pushing
them
down
each
time
they
turned
into
feathers
and
came
back
in
front
of
the
sun
as
before
the
sun
then
said
he
was
convinced
that
they
were
his
children
his
wife
said
they
told
you
they
were
your
children
but
you
have
treated
them
the
sun
replied
they
certainly
are
my
children
but
i
did
not
believe
it
the
sun
asked
his
wife
to
prepare
a
sweatlodge
as
soon
as
they
had
eaten
she
made
a
sweatlodge
covered
with
a
blue
blanket
on
one
side
a
black
one
on
another
side
a
white
one
on
another
side
and
a
yellow
one
on
another
side
his
wife
had
the
stones
heated
red
hot
like
red
hot
iron
they
three
went
right
in
but
the
sun
only
came
out
again
when
the
bath
had
been
heated
the
fourth
time
the
boys
were
as
if
they
had
been
boiled
he
pushed
back
the
skin
which
was
between
their
fingers
and
toes
he
fixed
for
them
their
lower
leg
muscles
their
knees
their
thighs
their
biceps
their
elbows
and
their
lower
arms
he
made
the
hair
of
their
heads
come
to
their
hips
twisting
it
off
at
that
length
he
made
their
ears
their
eyelashes
and
their
eyebrows
their
noses
their
mouths
and
their
faces
he
fixed
every
part
of
their
bodies
as
it
should
be
the
sun
went
out
of
the
bath
with
the
boys
and
sat
with
them
on
the
seat
where
his
wife
usually
sat
they
were
just
like
men
when
the
wife
of
the
sun
came
and
stood
in
front
of
them
she
looked
at
them
closely
but
could
not
distinguish
one
from
the
other
move
husband
she
said
the
one
sitting
in
the
middle
moved
himself
you
told
me
you
had
not
been
with
any
woman
but
you
fooled
me
these
are
your
children
you
must
have
a
wife
go
home
with
them
the
woman
said
the
sun
spoke
to
his
wife
saying
that
these
were
his
children
but
that
if
he
went
away
with
them
to
the
earth
she
would
be
lonesome
only
today
there
was
a
good
sunset
just
now
when
you
said
your
eye
winked
he
said
to
her
i
am
jealous
of
what
is
far
away
she
said
the
sun
said
he
would
not
go
but
would
talk
to
his
children
my
boys
shall
i
give
you
names
yes
it
is
not
well
to
be
without
names
they
replied
then
the
sun
said
he
would
name
them
he

one
replied
that
their
mother
had
told
them

that

would
be
happy
if
they
brought

the
sun
replied
that
he
had
no
property
no
horse
saddle
bridle
halter
rope
or
saddle
blanket
the
fly
had
told
them
that
the
sun
had
these
but
he
looked
around
again
and
reported
that
the
sun
had
them
close
by
let
us
go
over
there
one
of
them
proposed
they
went
to
a
fenced
enclosure
and
entered
through
a
gate
the
yard
was
so
full
of
black
bears
that
the
mass
of
their
moving
backs
occupied
the
entire
space
which
of
those
are
my
horses
the
sun
asked
they
are
fearful
animals
the
boys
replied
these
are
my
horses
the
sun
insisted
and
mounted
one
of
them
and
rode
around
on
it
the
fly
informed
the
boys
that
they
were
being
deceived
the
sun
proposed
that
they
should
go
in
another
direction
to
another
enclosure
inside
this
yard
were
deer
mule
deer
elk
and
the
sun
announced
that
these
were
his
horses
and
told
the
boys
to
choose
any
one
they
liked
and
catch
it
which
is
the
largest
he
asked
them
these
are
not
horses
the
boys
replied
they
are
named
deer
we
asked
you
for
the
sun
insisted
they
were
his
horses
and
that
he
rode
them
great
distances
well
you
have
outwitted
me
i
thought
i
would
succeed
in
outwitting
you
but
you
have
the
younger
brother
asked
the
sun
what
he
was
concealing
from
them
saying
he
could
find
them
the
sun
asked
them
not
to
say
that
and
proposed
that
they
look
in
another
place
where
he
had
a
few
horses
confined
they
went
to
the
place
indicated
and
found
the
place
filled
with
antelope
sheep
goats
and
pigs
catch
any
one
of
these
you
want
the
sun
said
you
tend
to
them
here
alone
the
boys
replied
and
walked
out
leaving
the
sun
who
followed
behind
they
went
to
the
house
and
ate
a
meal
their
fly
told
them
that
the
sun
horses
were
in
the
enclosure
that
had
four
doors
when
they
had
finished
eating
they
went
to
this
enclosure
which
was
a
house
with
a
roof
having
holes
in
it
it
had
spikes
like
irons
sticking
up
from
it
it
was
closed
and
completely
dark
there
are
horses
in
there
the
fly
told
them
the
sun
said
i
told
you
it
was
one
of
the
boys
asked
that
they
might
look
in
there
was
a
door
there
which
he
opened
a
little
beyond
it
was
another
door
a
little
beyond
another
and
a
little
beyond
that
another
and
still
beyond
that
another
they
now
came
to
horses
in
the
enclosure
but
could
not
enter
by
standing
on
something
they
could
see
through
a
hole
in
the
roof
they
could
not
get
in
between
the
horses
until
they
were
caused
to
separate
and
to
open
up
a
passage
the
sun
then
told
them
to
catch
the
horse
that
they
thought
was
his
the
fly
sitting
by
one
of
their
ears
told
them
they
were
to
catch
the
horse
with
a
rope
which
they
should
induce
the
sun
to
give
them
when
the
sun
again
urged
them
to
catch
the
horse
without
delay
they
asked
whether
they
should
lead
the
horse
by
the
mane
or
carry
him
out
in
their
hands
the
sun
with
spotted
ropes
in
his
hand
went
right
through
the
door
which
he
opened
he
gave
one
of
the
ropes
to
each
of
the
boys
telling
them
to
catch
the
horses
which
were
his
the
animals
were
milling
around
in
the
enclosure
in
the
center
was
one
which
was
not
moving
a
sorrel
with
a
small
white
spot
on
its
forehead
its
mane
reached
the
ground
when
it
raised
its
head
one
of
the
boys
started
toward
it
the
horses
separating
he
threw
the
rope
and
caught
the
horse
which
he
led
back
the
sun
then
told
the
other
boy
to
catch
a
horse
wanting
to
know
who
had
told
him
which
horse
to
catch
there
was
a
stallion
running
around
the
outside
of
the
herd
its
mane
reached
the
ground
he
was
acting
wild
but
the
fly
told
them
that
although
he
acted
as
if
he
were
mean
he
was
really
gentle
he
directed
them
to
take
both
these
horses
from
the
sun
when
the
other
boy
started
with
his
rope
toward
the
stallion
he
was
running
around
the
outside
of
the
herd
and
coming
toward
the
boy
when
he
came
close
and
saw
the
boy
he
stopped
and
then
wheeled
back
the
boy
lassoed
it
and
immediately
the
horse
trotted
up
to
him
nosing
his
arm
he
led
the
stallion
up
beside
the
sorrel
horse
which
was
a
mare
the
sun
said
there
they
are
ride

them
with
you
to
the
the
boys
then
asked
for
the
horse
trappings
for
which
they
had
also
come
the
sun
said
he
did
not
know
what
they
meant
by
horse
trappings
the
younger
boy
said
well
if
you
do
not
know
what
horse
trappings
are
do
not
again
put
them
on
these
horses
in
the
the
sun
asked
who
it
was

had
made
them
as

as
he
was
himself

replied
that

made
them
speak
wisely
they
then
asked
by
name
for

turning
his
back
to
the
boys

walked
away
and
opened
a
door

enter
they
went
in
and
saw
saddles
lying
there
with
bridles
hanging
on
the
saddle
horns
the
blankets
were
lying
beneath
before
they
went
in
the
fly

in
and
selected
two
out
of
all
the
saddles

was
lying
at
the

at
the

sun
urged
them
to
hurry
up
each
boy
stepped
toward
the
saddle
he
had
chosen
when
they
did
so
the
saddles
moved
of
themselves
with
the
blankets
and
bridles
there
was
a
sound
gij
of
the
moving
leather
and
tsil
as
they
came
to
rest
the
sun
turned
his
face
away
and
took
a
black
silk
handkerchief
which
had
two
white
stripes
around
the
border
from
his
pocket
with
this
he
wiped
his
eyes
i

to

away
from
the
sun
house
where
towards

a
post
stands
up
with
white
hair
which
reaches
to
the
ground
and
turns
up
again
the
rain
falls
on
it
they
rode
their
horses
around
this
post
four
times
and
came
back
where
they
were
standing
before
as
the
sun
directed
them
to
do
when
they
had
finished
the
sun
wife
came
up
to
them
and
told
her
husband
to
count
for
his
sons
the
two
saddle
blankets
two
halters
two
bridles
two
ropes
and
two
saddles
the
sun
told
them
to
start
home
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
them
he
charged
them
to
take
good
care
of
the
saddle
blankets
and
directed
that
the
gray
horse
should
go
in
the
lead
because
he
knew
the
trail
to
the
place
midway
between
the
earth
and
the
sky
from
that
point
the
sorrel
horse
was
to
lead
because
that
one
knew
the
way
from
there
on
when
they
returned
where
their
mother
lived
he
told
them
to
stake
the
horses
out
for
four
nights
the
sorrel
was
to
be
staked
toward
the
east
and
the
gray
to
the
west
having
ridden
the
horses
among
the
people
they
were
to
unsaddle
them
in
some
good
place
a
white
saddle
blanket
was
to
be
placed
toward
the
east
a
black
one
to
the
south
a
yellow
one
to
the
west
and
a
blue
one
to
the
north
the
bridles
halters
ropes
and
saddles
were
to
be
brought
to
the
camp
he
charged
them
to
keep
in
mind
what
he
was
telling
for
he
was
telling
them
this
that
they
might
be
good
men
he
divided
his
property
between
his
boys
he
told
them
after
the
horses
had
been
running
loose
four
days
to
go
to
them
early
in
the
morning
this
might
be
in
any
good
place
where
canyons
meet
making
a
flat
when
they
came
to
them
they
were
to
hold
out
their
hands
palms
upward
towards
the
horses
they
were
to
catch
the
horses
while
they
were
licking
their
hands
they
were
to
consider
what
he
told
them
and
when
they
should
go
for
the
horses
after
four
days
the
four
canyons
coming
together
would
be
full
of
horses
when
their
horses
had
been
caught
by
holding
out
their
hands
the
saddle
blankets
one
on
the
other
were
to
be
put
on
them
and
the
horses
were
to
be
saddled
they
were
to
ride
the
horses
all
day
until
sunset
when
they
were
to
be
turned
out
again
having
turned
them
out
they
were
told
they
might
go
the
next
day
to
see
what
was
happening
having
finished
his
speech
he
dismissed
the
boys
they
went
with
the
sun
until
they
came
to
the
top
of
the
ridge
where
they
stopped
the
sun
felt
the
horses
all
over
he
felt
of
their
legs
their
feet
their
faces
their
ears
their
manes
their
backs
petting
them
goodbye
my
horses
he
said
travel
well
for
my
boys
down
to
the
earth
there
is
food
for
you
on
the
earth
the
same
as
he
addressed
the
gray
horse
telling
him
to
be
the
leader
on
the
way
toward
the
earth
since
he
knew
the
way
he
told
the
boys
not
to
look
at
the
horses
feet
nor
to
look
behind
them
but
to
keep
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
tips
of
their
ears
they
started
before
they
knew
it
the
horses
had
changed
places
and
the
sorrel
was
leading
they
thought
the
earth
was
far
off
but
they
soon
found
the
horses

around
among
the
camps
until
sundown
and
then
rode
them
to
a
flat
where
four
canyons
came
together
they
hung
a
white
saddle
blanket
toward
the
east
a
black
one
to
the
south
a
yellow
one
to
the
west
and
a
blue
one
to
the

their
fly
told

to

the
blankets
in
four
places
making
an
enclosure
of
them
after
four
days
they
were
to
come
and
would
find
conditions
different
he
charged
the
boys
not
to
miss
doing
just
as
their
father
had
told
them
they
went
back
to
the
camp
carrying
the
saddles
bridles
halters
and
ropes
after
two
days
had
passed
their
fly
flew
away
he
returned
reporting
that
there
were
many
horses
filling
the
place
where
the
four
canyons
came
together
the
next
day
he
reported
that
the
horses
were
so
thick
one
could
walk
on
their
backs
the
next
day
the
fourth
about
sunrise
the
two
boys
went
there
with
their
ropes
in
their
hands
when
they
came
to
the
eastern
canyon
it
was
full
of
white
horses
the
southern
one
was
full
of
black
horses
the
western
was
full
of
yellow
horses
and
the
northern
canyon
with
blue
gray
horses
they
took
down
all
the
saddle
blankets
and
piled
them
together
with
valleys
in
four
directions
full
of
horses
they
did
not
know
their
former
horses
from
the
others
they
considered
how
they
might
distinguish
them
the
horses
were
milling
around
near
where
a
blanket
hung
they
were
all
mingled
together
with
the
colors
mixed
the
men
approached
the
horses
but
they
stopped
before
they
got
to
them
they
extended
their
hands
with
pollen
on
the
palms
and
the
horses
whinneyed
then
two
horses
trotted
up
to
them
and
licked
the
pollen
from
the
hands
of
their
owners
who
caught
them
while
they
did
it
they
led
these
horses
back
to
the
camp
where
the
saddles
were
lying
when
they
led
these
two
horses
all
the
others
followed
their
fly
told
them
all
about
the
two
horses
what
they
had
done
and
that
they
had
made
many
horses
for
them
four
days
from
now
it
would
come
about
that
the
broad
earth
would
be
covered
with
horses
their
fly
flew
to
the
sun
camp
and
the
sun
instructed
him
drive
the
horses
over
this
way
and
put
a
halter
on
top
of
that
mountain
put
a
rope
on
the
top
of
this
mountain
to
the
south
put
a
halter
on
the
top
of
the
mountain
to
the
west
and
put
a
rope
on
the
mountain
to
the
north
your
father
says
this
the
fly
told
them
the
older
of
the
brothers
told
the
people
that
they
should
ride
the
horses
and
not
think
they
were
wild
catch
any
of
them
and
saddle
them
when
you
have
ridden
your
horses
then
do
not
go
near
them
for
four
days
keep
away
from
the
horses
which
are
inside
where
the
halters
and
ropes
are
lying
turn
the
horses
loose
in
the
space
enclosed
by
the
ropes
and
the
halter
if
they
see
you
they
may
stampede
these
horses
will
be
of
great
value
to
the
brothers
rode
the
two
horses
and
the
others
all
followed
when
the
two
horses
whinneyed
the
others
all
answered

took
off
the
ropes
and
went

asked
their
mother
to
put
up
two
posts
and
to
put
a
smooth
pole
across
their
tops

was
asked
to
put

saddles
in
a
row
i

a
short
one
he
said
to
his
mother
you

hole

and
another
there
my
son
she
replied

he
said
he
called
saying
they
would
go

horses
he
said
to
him
he
ran
where
one
rope
was
and
the
other
one
went
where
the
other
rope
was
when
they
came
to
the
two
ropes
they
circled
around
driving
the
horses
all
towards
each
other
they
could
not
find
their
own
horses
the
sun
horses
they
went
into
the
enclosure
and
walked
around
even
when
they
went
around
that
way
they
could
not
find
the
horses
they
looked
for
them
again
going
around
among
the
other
horses
but
they
could
not
find
them
the
horses
touched
each
other
they
were
so
thick
then
said
naiyenezgani
why
do
you
act
so
is
your
mind
gone
you
say
you
met
your
father
yesterday
and
that
you
spent
the
day
going
around
the
horses
he
took
them
out
of
the
herd
and
away
from
naiyenezgani
caught
a
black
stallion
and
the
other
brother
a
sorrel
gelding
when
they
led
them
to
the
camp
their
mother
asked
why
he
had
caught
a
sorrel
and
told
him
to
turn
him
loose
and
catch
a
white
gelding
she
said
the
gray
and
sorrel
horses
were
made
for
them
and
that
they
were
well
trained
the
day
before
she
told
them
to
hurry
and
drive
the
horses
in
rode
the
sorrel
horse
back
and
unsaddled
it
he
then
caught
a
white
horse
and
drove
the
gray
horses
back
to
the
camp
let
us
go
he
said
to
his
brother
they
mounted
the
horses
and
rode
along
their
mother
spoke
to
them
my
boys
take
off
that
yellow
saddle
and
put
on
a
white
when
they
came
riding
back
where
their
mother
was
a
horse
whinneyed
it
sounded
like
the
voice
of
the
gray
stallion
that
used
to
be
his
horse
another
horse
whinneyed
in
this
direction
and
the
voice
was
like
that
of
the
sorrel
mare
they
knew
their
horses
when
they
whinneyed
and
one
said
to
the
other
brother
those
are
our
horses
whinneying
but
we
can
not
do
anything
about
let
us
hurry
the
other
said
they
rode
toward
the
herd
of
horses
but
the
horses
started
to
run
and
the
herd
broke
up
while
they
were
looking
they
ran
where
their
horses
whinneyed
their
fly
told
them
that
the
horses
had
already
run
into
the
enclosure
and
that
the
four
doors
were
shut
they
heard
them
whinneying
far
away
their
fly
said
the
horses
were
already
in
their
stable
but
they
still
whinneyed
they
drove
the
other
horses
near
the
camp
the
older
brother
told
the
people
to
form
in
a
line
around
the
horses
he
said
they
were
going
to
stake
out
horses
for
them
the
people
replied
that
they
had
no
ropes
that
only
the
two
brothers
had
them
they
asked
the
brothers
to
make
ropes
for
them
they
were
told
to
wait
while
they
returned
where
the
horses
used
to
be
they
told
them
that
they
would
have
ropes
the
next
day
the
brothers
went
in
different
directions
calling
to
each
other
they
met
and
sent
their
fly
to
the
sun
because
the
people
were
without
ropes
he
told
his
brother
to
go
back
where
he
had
been
staying
he
directed
him
also
to
take
the
bridle
off
and
to
leave
the
rope
as
it
was
tied
to
the
saddle
when
the
sun
is
in
the
middle
of
the
sky
we
will
drive
the
horses
back
although
it
is
late
the
sun
will
be
in
the
same
place
he
the
sun
may
give
us
something
he
said
the
fly
returned
and
reported
your
horse
was
standing
behind
him
he
sat
watching
where
the
stallions
were
fighting
each
other
he
kept
looking
at
them
and
then
he
went
a
little
the
sun
disk
was
yellow
as
at
sunset
he
looked
down
four
times
the
yellow
beams
struck
under
his
raised
knees
from
the
other
side
they
also
streamed
toward
him
nothing
happened
and
he
got
up
and
went
to
his
horse
when
he
put
his
foot
in
the
stirrup
and
mounted
ropes
were
tied
in
four
places
to
the
saddle
strings
where
there
had
been
no
ropes
before
both
saddles
were
that
way
they
both
mounted
together
and
their
horses
pawed
the
ground
and
snorted
he
rode
back
to
the
camp
loping
and
the
other
horses
strung
out
behind
him
the
other
brother
was
running
his
horse
on
the
other
side
they
stopped
near
the
camp
the
horses
were
all
lined
up
facing
him
he
called
to
the
one
on
horseback
come
he
rode
up
to
him
and
he
asked
how
many
ropes
there
were
the
other
replied
he
did
not
know
for
he
had
not
counted
them
and
inquired
of
the
other
how
many
ropes
he
had
the
first
speaker
replied
that
he
did
not
know
then
the
younger
brother
said
the
other
should
catch
the
horses
for
them
and
lead
them
out
while
he
remained
on
his
horse
where
he
was
the
other
brother
then
rode
among
the
horses
and
caught
a
mare
he
led
the
horse
out
and
gave
the
rope
to
one
of
the
men
he
rode
back
among
the
horses
and
caught
a
stallion
when
he
had
caught
six
horses
the
ropes
were
all
gone
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
and
his
brother
rode
up
to
him
had
you
only
six
ropes
he
asked
yes
i
only
had
six
and
i
have
caught
six
horses
now
take
your
turn
and
i
will
remain
here
on
the
second
brother
caught
the
horses
and
reported
that
he
had
chosen
the
better
horses
the
horses
were
all
good
but
some
of
them
looked
to
be
small
they
told
the
people
there
were
only
seven
saddles
and
that
so
many
of
the
men
might
have
saddles
but
that
the
others
must
ride
around
bareback
for
the
present
he
told
them
that
some
time
they
might
have
saddles
because
the
sun
knew
of
their
need
and
he
himself
knew
it
he
instructed
them
to
tie
out
their
horses
close
by
he
said
if
they
heard
the
horses
nickering
they
would
know
that
the
stallions
were
covering
the
mares
they
would
also
know
the
colts
when
they
were
foaled
if
they
turned
their
horses
loose
they
might
not
know
them
the
ropes
he
said
would
guard
their
horses
for
them
they
would
now
drive
back
the
other
horses
while
those
who
had
received
horses
staked
theirs
out
he
drove
the
horses
away
and
hung
his
bridle
up
the
other
one
he
laid
in
another
direction
he
took
the
saddle
and
everything
else
back
to
the
camp
they
came
back
to
the
camp
in
the
middle
of
the
night
but
they
did
not
know
it
was
night
because
the
sun
had
not
moved
when
two
days
had
passed
two
men
came
there
were
many
horses
where
they
had
passed
they
reported
that
something
was
running
around
the
other
side
of
this
large
mountain
they
did
not
know
what
it
was
nor
to
whom
it
belonged
they
wondered
what
was
meant
and
sent
their
fly
to
find
out
he
flew
away
and
came
back
almost
immediately
he
said
it
was
true
on
the
ridge
beyond
the
mountain
he
saw
horse
tracks
and
a
trail
with
dust
as
fine
as
flour
one
of
the
brothers
asked
his
mother
to
cook
for
the
men
quickly
it
was
while
they
were
eating
that
the
fly
reported
fly
back
there
he
directed
him
he
told
the
visitors
to
remain
for
they
were
no

tired
they
went
back
where
the
bridle
was
lying
they
took
off
the
rope
and
hung
it
toward
the
east
they
spoke
to
the
bridle
asking
that
the
horses
wherever
they
went
should
come
back
together
during
the
night
the
visitors
were
as
the
two
brothers
had
been
they
had
no
eyelashes
or
eyebrows
their
ears
were
round
and
their
heads
were
smooth
there
were
webs
between
their
fingers
and
toes
when
they
were
asked
whence
they
came
they
replied
that
they
had
assumed
there
were
people
living
somewhere
their
own
people
had
been
killed
off
by
something
until
only
the
two
were
left
they
saved
themselves
at
night
by
digging
a
trench
and
covering
it
with
a
large
rock
when
they
started
away
one
of
the
brothers
asked
where
they
were
going
they
replied
that
they
did
not
know
where
they
were
going
but
preferred
not
to
stay
where
they
were
they
said
they
did
not
like
to
be
with
many
peoples
they
preferred
staying
there
with
their
present
hosts
naiyenezgani
asked
them
to
tell
their
story
during
the
night
when
night
came
he
called
four
men
to
come
and
listen
to
what
the
visitors
were
about
to
tell
he
asked
each
of
the
four
men
to
question
the
guests

is
the
country

another
of
the
men
to

them

asked
if

living
in
that
place
saying
he
did
not
believe
what
the
other
had
said

of
the
guests
replied
that
it
was
true
he
said
they
did
not
know
how
to
tell
untruths

of
it
and
therefore

there
where
they
intended
to

with
them
naiyenezgani
called
upon
a
third
man
to
question
them
why
did
you
leave
a
trail
for
them

to
look
over
the
body
of
their
enemy
to
examine
his
ears
his
eyes
and
his
mouth
the
fly
flew
to
the
man
and
alighted
on
his
ear
when

the
man
said

is
not
just
you
you
smell
like
a
the

that
they
could
not
come
up
to
the
man
for
while
he
walked
in
one
direction

of
his
head

had
no
eyes
in

has
something
long
in

is
the
same
sort
of
a
person
that
you

them
to

around
to
a
certain
gap
in
the
ridge
where
the
monster
was
accustomed
to
pass
and
stand
side
by
side
he
promised
to
let
them
know
when
the
enemy
approached
when
the
monster
walked
along
the
fly
came
back
where
the
brothers
were
standing
side
by
side
and
said

is
coming
up
here
very
close
if

stops
here
you
must
cut
his
head
off
now

sees
anyone

makes
a
sweep
with
his
long
weapon
and
kills
the
person

a
long
way

apart
and
was
scattered
over
considerable
space

flesh
was
quivering

not
accompany
them
where
the
horses
were
they
went
with
them
where

projecting
ridge
beyond

again
to
find

from
which
point
the
monster
could
be
attacked
with
the
best
chances
for
success
they
saw
him
walking
in
the
distance
and
then
they
saw
him
standing
where
he
was
accustomed
to
come
up
the
ridge
the
fly
reported
that

a
good
place
for
the

his
blanket
come

he
said
they
came
back
in
the
manner
they
went
landing
on
the
successive
mountains
until
they
reached
the
camp
they
danced
a
war
dance
near
the

asked
their
mother
to

the
people
and
to
ask
the
visitors
also
to

she
told
the
people
to
assemble
saying
that
her
sons
must
have
seen
something
during
the
day

if
he
had
been
alone
he
too
could
have
done
it
by
himself
naiyenezgani
said
we
both
attacked
him
because
we
could
do
it
quickly
we
killed
him
quickly
because
our
father
helped
us
if
it

one
of
you

done
nothing
with
this
one
that
we

you
up
he
had
killed
all
the
people
who
lived
with
these
two
men
and
just
now
he
was
coming
for
you
before
we
had
known
it
he
would
have
killed
us
all
there
are
no
people
living
on
the
edges
of
the
earth
we
are
all
that
are
left
he
killed
people
this
way
suppose
that
person
should
come
on
you
he
would
kill
you
this
he
threw
the
weapon
to
a
distant
bush
it
went
around
the
tree
and
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
cut
off
he
was
killing
people
thus
now
we
will
live
well
and
no
one
will
bother
us
a
man
is
going
around
the
earth
in
one
day
and
he
will
tell
us
about

away
and
his
mother
spoke
to
him
my
son
put

this
belt
she
said
offering
him
the
one
the
sun
wife
had
given
her
i
am
going

but
today
it

he
said
they
went
to
bed
take
good
care
of
things
and
do
not
be
afraid
of
anything
said
when
it
was

said
to

said
i

but
i
do
not

replied
he
started
telling

to
watch
for
him
on
a
certain
mountain
point
i
will
be

about
he
started
away
traveling
with
a
blue
flute
which
had
wings
he
went
with
this
from
place
to
place
and
was
back
home
before
long
he
went
entirely
around
the
border
of
the
world
on
which
people
were
living
the
belt
was
a
blue
flute
he
thought
with
it
four
ways
and
looked
into
it
four
ways
before
noon
a
light
rain
fell
on
the
projecting
mountain
that
cleared
off
and
then
he
came
laughing
it
was
not
far
only
so
large
he
said
joining
the
tips
of
his
forefinger
and
his
thumb
have
you
your

he
asked
have
you
collected
everything

caught
some
of
the
horses

saddled
them
and
drove
the
other
horses
near
the
camp
where
they
herded
them
they
called
the
people
to
assemble
and
when
they
came
caught

for

he
gave
away
ten
horses
in

i
will
give
you
no
more

he
said
tomorrow
we
will

he
drove
the
horses
back
where

out
our

each
party
chose
a

when
they
had
finished
they
asked
the
brothers
which
way
they
were
going
they
replied
that
they
were
going

drive
their
horses
to
the
top
of
yonder
mountain

rode
towards

a

went
higher

streamed
toward

he
came
where
the

come
down

themselves
they
moved
in

shot
across
with
him
beyond

came
to
the
mountain
of

which
formed
a

barrier
in

there
a

whirlwind
twisted
through
for
him
so
that
he
passed

fell
for
him

became
damp

moved

jumped
away
from

toward

but
in

undid
the
lightning
with

he
was

up
and
took
the

out
the

was
his
boy
there
were
twelve
pipes
in

tobacco
was

the

fixed
a
smoke
for
him
in
one
of
these
it
was
not
the

proper
tobacco
but
a
kind
that
killed
whoever
smoked
it
the
boy
drew
on
the
pipe
just
once
and
the
tobacco
was
burned
out
the
sun
prepared
another
pipeful
which
was
gone
when
the
boy
had
drawn
on
the
pipe
twice
he
filled
a
third
pipe
this
time
the
boy
drew
on
it
three
times
and
the
tobacco
was
consumed
the
last
time
the
pipe
was
filled
the
boy
drew
four
times
before
the
tobacco
was
burned
out
toward
the
east
there
was
a
blazing
fire
of
black
into
which
the
sun
threw
the
boy
he
turned
into
a
downy
feather
and
landed
in

of
his

who
expressed
his
surprise
there
was
a
fire
of
blue
toward
the
south
into

the

was

thrown

again
turned

landed
in

the
fire
toward
the
west
was
of
yellow
from
which
the
boy
escaped
in
the

manner
finally
the
boy
was
thrown
into
a
white
fire
of
which
blazed
up
in
the
north
he
escaped
in
the

manner
as
before

in

fire

been
poked
with
lightning
of
the
corresponding
color
when
the
boy
had
successfully
withstood
this
last
test
the
sun
directed
his
wife
to
prepare
a
sweatbath
she
did
this
by
spreading
four
blankets
of
cloud

yellow
and
white
she
put
on
the
four
blankets

made
in

was
placed

counting
this

had
twelve
sons
with
whom
he
formed
a
line
he
then
asked
his
wife
to
find
him
in
the
line
but
this
she
was
unable
to
do
because
they
all
looked
alike
she
said
the
sun
then
placed
a
gun
and
a
quiver
on
a
shelf
and
asked
his
son
to
choose
which
he
would
have
after
sighting
the
gun
he
concluded
he
did
not
like
it
he
put
the
quiver
over
his
shoulder
and
took
out
two
arrows
when
he
tried
these
he
hit
the
target
in
the
center
he
chose
the
quiver
saying
he
liked
it
all
the
other
sons
of
the
sun
had
guns
the
sun
had
them
shoot
at
each
other
in
fun
those
who
had
guns
beat
the
boy
who
had
arrows
and
drove
him
off
on
one
side
horses
were
being
made
and
on
the
other
deer
the
one
who
was
in
charge
of
making
these
is
named
they
put
for
him
a
light
brown
mountain
inside
of
which
cattle
goats
sheep
pigs
horses
mules
and
donkeys
were
living
all
these
are
the
food
of
white
people
in
this
mountain
also
were
guns
blankets
and
all
kinds
of
metals
on
the
other
side
he
put
for
him
a
mountain
on
which
century
plants
were
growing
with
their
yellow
flower
stalks
standing
all
around
the
edges
on
this
mountain
too
were
sunflowers
yellow
with
blossoms
cactus
yucca
pi√±on
oaks
junipers
the
fruit
of
all
of
which
was
perpetually
ripe
all
the
other
wild
vegetable
foods
of
the
indians
grew
there
also
the
mountain
was
always
yellow
with
flowers
the
sun
asked
the
boy
which
of
these
two
mountains
he
would
choose
he
decided
to
take
the
one
which
was
yellow
with
flowers
where
fruit
was
always
ripe
he
did
not
care
for
the
light
brown
mountain
which
stood
toward
the
east
he
announced
that
the
yellow
mountain
would
be
his
and
would
belong
in
the
future
to
the
indians
they
then
opened
a
door
in
the
side
of
the
brown
mountain
and
drove
out
cattle
goats
sheep
pigs
horses
donkeys
and
mules
these
became
the
property
of
your
white
people
nation
the
sun
son
asked
that
some
horses
be
given
him
the
sun
reminded
him
he
had
asked
for
the
other
mountain
and
wanted
to
know
why
he
had
not
then
asked
for
horses
from
the
east
mirage
people
rounded
up
some
horses
for
him
the
red
dust
of
the
covered
the
ground
there
are
no
horses
the
sun
said
the
boy
asked
again
for
horses
only
to
be
told
he
should
have
asked
before
when
he
chose
between
the
two
mountains
he
asked
that
notwithstanding
he
be
given
some
horses
the
sun
took
up
a
rope
and
led
back
a
chestnut
stallion
from
the
east
he
tied
the
horse
which
stood
pawing
the
ground
and
nickering
the
boy
rode
back
on
it
to
the
place
where
i
suppose
toxastin
and
his
grandmother
lived
he
rode
back
in
a
single
day
and
tied
his
horse
the
horse
kept
nickering
and
pawing
the
earth
all
the
time
he
would
not
graze
and
the
boy
was
not
satisfied
he
rode
back
to
the
house
of
the
sun
took
off
the
rope
and
the
horse
ran
off
toward
the
east
kicking
up
his
heels
the
boy
told
his
father
the
sun
that
the
stallion
he
had
given
him
was
not
satisfactory
and
that
he
had
come
to
ask
for
a
different
horse
his
father
went
away
and
returned
with
two
horses
a
stallion
and
a
mare
these
are
what
you
want
i
suppose
the
sun
said
and
gave
the
boy
a
rope
a
halter
a
saddle
blanket
and
a
saddle
the
boy
led
the
horse
back
to
the
place
where
toxastin
his
grandmother
and
his
mother
lived
he
led
the
horses
back

the

the

at

the

he
turned
out
the
two
horses
here
to
the
east
each
time
the
sun
son
came
back
there
he
found
the
two
horses
playing
after
four
days
he
drove
the
horses
up
the
valley
a
little
way
four
times
when
he
went
the
fourth
day
to
see
them
he
found
the
tracks
of
a
colt
that
cottonwood
tree
stood
in

a

the
one
they
meant
that
one
is
the
sun
they
said
we
did
it
in
the
presence
of
that
one
walking
then
said
she
would
do
something
unseemly
thinking
she
would
do
it
where
the
sun
first
shone
in
the
morning
she
seated
herself
there
she
was
doing
this
only
that
people
might
live
there
were
no
people
and
she
thought
there
should
be
many
and
she
did
it
for
that
reason
she
became
pregnant
she
and
the
one
walking
around
were
the
only
ones
who
understood
about
generation
she
gave
birth
to
a

there
where
she
sat
she
went
back
to
the
child
early
each
morning
for
four
mornings
and
on
the
fourth
the
child
walked
back
with
her
he
was
entirely
dressed

he
walked
back
with
her
it
is
not
good
that
there
should
be
only
this
one
she
said
it
will
be
well
for
me
to
do
an
improper
thing
she
sat
repeatedly
where
the
water
was
dripping
and
became
pregnant
again
she
gave
birth
a
second
time

a

i
will
do

i
did

she
went

her
child

the
fourth
morning
after
he
was
born
the
child
returned
with
her
he
was
dressed
in
buckskin
shoes
and
all
she
had
given
birth
to
two
children
the
latter
one
she
named
and
the
first
one
bilnajnollije
they
were
the
children
of
this
one
the
sun
a
black
water
vessel
by
the
door
of
the
sun
house
was
flecked
with
sunshine
he
caused
dark
lightning
to
dart
under
it
from
four
directions
he
caused
it
to
thunder
out
of
it
in
four
directions
he
caused
it
to
thunder
in
four
directions
he
caused

rain
to
fall
in
four
directions
he
caused
fruits
to
stand
on
the
earth
in
lines
pointing
in
four
directions

they
said
he
has
treated
us
a
yellow
water
vessel
by

was
flecked
with

she

because
of

are
well
with
she
caused
the

to
agitate
the
grass
from

us

said
with
no
trouble
for
us
it
comes
to
its
place
the
earth
will
remain
well
for
us
they
said
it
is
still
the
same
way
for
us
that
it
was
long
ago
we
are
thankful
mother
where
does
our
father
live
the
boys
asked
do
not
ask
for
he
lives
in
a
dangerous
place
replied
do
not
say
he
lives
in
a
dangerous
place
but
show
us
where
it
is
for
we
are
going
there
they
replied
if
you
go
you
must
travel
only
by
night
during
the
day
one
must
sit
still
she
told
them
she
said
this
for
she
meant
for
them
to
make
the
journey
without
being
seen
by
the
sun
they
wondered
why
she
told
them
to
go
only
at
night
and
resolved
to
travel
by
day
they
came
near
where
the
ground
was
black
with
mosquitoes
that
had
teeth
of
and
there
was
no
way
to
pass
through
them
they
caused
a
rain
yellow
with
sunshine
to
fall
on
them
and
wet
their
wings
so
that
they
stuck
to
the
trees
by
this
means
they
passed
beyond
them
this
is
why
she
said
it
is
dangerous
they
said
to
each
other
they
came
where
the
earth
was
crossed
with
a
stripe
of
cactus
which
had
spines
of
a
black
whirlwind
with
a
core
of
passed
twisting
through
the
cactus
the
boys
got
by
it
this
was
surely
the
bad
place
of
which
our
mother
told
us
they
said
as
they
were
going
on
toward
their
father
house
they
came
to
sand
which
if
one
stepped
on
it
rolled
back
with
him
there
was
no
way
to
get
through
it
a
big
black
measuring
worm
having
his
back
striped
with
a
rainbow
bent
himself
over
the
sand
for
them
and
they
crossed
over
they
were
now
approaching
their
destination
when
they
found
the
house
surrounded
by
lakes
which
could
not
be
avoided
a
turquoise
bird
sat
in
the
ear
of
one
of
them
and
directed
them
on
their
way
the
sun
wife
saw
the
two
men
pass
through
avoiding
the
four
bodies
of
water
that
surrounded
the
house
she
concealed
them
under
the
bed
which
stood
in
the
house
when
the
sun
returned
he
saw
the
tracks
of
two
men
and
asked
where
they
had
gone
the
sun
wife
replied
that
they
were
not
there
you
are
always
saying
you
have
made
no
visits
and
yet
your
two
sons
come
here
she
said
the
sun
directed
that
they
should
come
to
him
they
sat
facing
him
he
had
tobacco
hanging
in
sacks
in
four
places
it
was
black
tobacco
which
grew
on
stalks
of
he
had
a
turquoise
pipe
with
holes
for
the
tobacco
to
burn
in
with
this
tobacco
he
killed
those
who
were
not
really
his
children
they
heard
him
draw
on
the
pipe
once
and
then
he
tapped
it
on
something
and
the
ashes
rolled
out
fix
me
a
smoke
that
is
why
i
came
one
of
the
boys
said
they
two
went
to
the
sack
which
was
hanging
on
this
side
it
was
filled
with
large
blue
tobacco
which
grew
on
stalks
of
he
filled
a
pipe
with
bowls
and
lighted
it
again
having
drawn
on
the
pipe
he
passed
it
to
them
he
heard
them
draw
on
the
pipe
once
and
then
the
ashes
fell
out
prepare
a
smoke
for
me
for
i
came
for
that
purpose
one
of
the
boys
said
again
when
the
other
kinds
yellow
and
white
had
been
tried
from
the
remaining
one
of
the
boys
produced
some
tobacco
and
a
pipe
made
of
clay
with
a
hole
through
it
this
is
my
pipe
and
my
tobacco
the
boy
announced
why
did
you
not
tell
me
before
that
you
had
tobacco
the
sun
said
he
had
chairs
placed
and
took
a
seat
between
the
two
boys
the
three
looked
just
alike
come
move
yourself
the
sun
wife
said
so
that
she
might
distinguish
him
from
the
others
they
are
surely
my
children
the
sun
declared
what
do
you
desire
he
asked
them
the
boys
said
they
had
come
to
hear
him
ask
that
the
sun
urged
them
to
ask
for
what
they
wished
without
delay
as
he
had
many
things
the
sun
had
domesticated
animals
in
four
corrals
on
four
sides
of
his
house
he
had
four
kinds
which
were
bad
they
were
bear
coyote
panther
and
wolf
of
which
one
is
afraid
he
led
a
bear
from
the
eastern
corral
remarking
that
this
was
probably
the
sort
they
meant
that
it
was
his
pet
the
boys
refused
it
saying
they
had
come
for
his
horse
in
turn
he
led
animals
from
corrals
at
the
south
and
west
which
were
refused
each
time
on
the
advice
of
the
monitor
that
sat
in
the
ear
of
one
of
the
boys
the
sun
pretended
he
had
no
other
horse
that
he
was
poor
the
monitor
urged
them
to
persist
in
their
request
saying
that
the
sun
could
not
refuse
he
finally
led
to
them
one
of
the
horses
which
was
walking
around
unconfined
he
was
just
skin
and
bones
the
rope
also
was
poor
did
you
ask
for
this
one
the
sun
said
that
is
the
one
they
replied
the
sun
told
them
the
horse
could
not
travel
far
but
the
boys
said
that
was
the
animal
they
wanted
he
gave
them
the
horse
with
the
admonition
that
they
must
not
let
see
it
or
she
would
send
them
away
with
it
it
looked
so
bad
the
boys
assured
him
it
would
be
all
right
he
replied
that
she
would
be
surprised
at
least
he
requested
them
to
tell
that
he
the
sun
always
told
the
truth
he
charged
the
two
boys
that
they
should
not
lie
to
each
other
this
is
a
good
day
for
you
both
he
told
them
thank
you
my
mother
thank
you
my
father
it
is
true
that
it
is
fortunate
for
us
it
was
for
that
reason
you
raised
us

said

this
fragment
of
the
story
having
been
told
the
narrator
refused
to
proceed
perhaps
because
he
knew
it
had
already
been
several
times
recorded
the
adolescence
ceremony
the
sun
was
the
one
who
arranged
the
ceremony
for
unclean
women
she
sat
thus
on
her
knees
and
the
red
light
from
the
sun
shone
into
her
she
was
living
alone
when
she
becomes
a
woman
they
straighten
her

in

line

sing

the
drum
is
beaten
they
dance

shook
himself
by

took
the

up
and
threw
him
over
there
then

shook
his

and
higher
in
the

the
indians

the
indians
who
were
dancing
went
up
with
the

they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
dancing
up
there
and
the

they
moved
