i
there
low
fennel
said
major
dale
we
pulled
up
short
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
before
me
lay
a
little
valley
carpeted
with
heather
purple
slopes
hemming
it
in
a
group
of
four
tall
firs
guarded
the
house
which
was
couched
in
the
hollow
of
the
dip
a
low
rambling
building
in
parts
showing
evidence
of
great
age
and
in
other
parts
of
the
modern
improver
that
the
new
wing
continued
the
major
raising
his
stick
projecting
out
this
way
it
the
only
addition
i
made
to
the
house
which
as
it
stood
had
insufficient
accommodation
for
the
servants
it
is
a
quaint
old
place
it
is
and
i
loath
to
part
with
it
especially
as
it
means
a
big
loss
ah
have
you
formed
any
theories
since
wiring
me
none
whatever
i
always
been
a
sceptic
addison
but
if
low
fennel
is
not
haunted
i
a
dutchman
by
the
lord
harry
i
laughed
reassuringly
and
the
two
of
us
descended
the
slope
to
the
white
gate
giving
access
to
a
trim
gravel
path
flanked
by
standard
roses
dale
greeted
us
at
the
door
she
was
as
i
had
heard
much
younger
than
the
major
and
a
distinctly
pretty
woman
in
so
far
dame
rumour
was
confirmed
other
things
i
had
heard
of
her
but
i
was
not
yet
in
a
position
to
pass
judgment
she
greeted
me
cordially
enough
although
women
are
usually
natural
actresses
i
thought
that
she
did
not
suspect
the
real
object
of
my
visit
tea
was
served
in
a
delightful
little
which
bore
evidence
of
having
but
recently
left
the
hands
of
london
decorators
but
when
presently
i
found
myself
alone
with
my
host
in
the
major
peculiar
sanctum
the
real
business
afoot
monopolised
our
conversation
the
room
which
major
dale
had
appropriated
as
a
study
was
on
the
ground
floor
of
the
new
wing
the
wing
which
he
himself
had
had
built
on
to
low
fennel
in
regard
to
its
outlook
it
was
a
charming
apartment
enough
with
roses
growing
right
up
to
the
open
window
so
that
their
perfume
filled
the
place
and
beyond
a
prospect
of
purple
heather
slopes
and
hills
sporting
prints
decorated
the
walls
and
the
library
was
entirely
or
almost
entirely
made
up
of
works
on
riding
hunting
shooting
racing
and
golf
with
a
sprinkling
of
and
nat
gould
novels
and
a
murray
handbook
or
two
it
was
a
most
cosy
room
probably
because
it
was
so
untidy
or
as
dale
phrased
it
so
manny
on
a
side
table
was
ranked
enough
liquid
refreshment
to
have
inebriated
a
regiment
and
in
one
corner
and
were
stacked
from
the
floor
some
two
feet
up
against
the
wall
we
were
soon
comfortably
ensconced
then
the
major
on
a
hard
leather
couch
and
i
in
a
deep
chair
it
an
awkward
sort
of
thing
to
explain
began
dale
puffing
away
at
a
cigar
and
staring
through
the
open
window
because
if
you
to
do
anything
you
will
want
full
particulars
i
nodded
well
the
major
continued
you
heard
how
that
blackguard
ellis
let
me
down
over
those
shares
the
result
i
had
to
sell
the
hall
fennel
hall
where
a
dale
has
been
since
the
time
of
elizabeth
but
still
never
mind
that
not
the
story
this
place
low
fennel
is
really
part
of
the
estate
and
i
have
leased
it
from
meyers
who
has
bought
the
hall
it
was
formerly
the
home
farm
but
since
my
father
time
it
has
not
been
used
for
that
purpose
the
new
farm
is
over
the
brow
of
the
hill
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
high
road
my
father
built
it
why
well
dale
shifted
uneasily
and
a
look
of
perplexity
crossed
his
jolly
red
face
there
were
stories
uncomfortable
stories
to
cut
a
long
story
short
seager
a
man
named
seager
who
occupied
it
at
the
time
i
was
at
sandhurst
was
found
dead
here
or
something
i
never
was
clear
as
to
the
particulars
but
there
was
an
inquiry
and
a
lot
of
fuss
and
in
short
no
one
would
occupy
the
property
therefore
the
governor
built
the
new
farm
low
fennel
has
been
empty
for
many
years
then
no
sir
only
for
one
ord
the
head
gardener
at
the
hall
lived
here
up
till
last
september
the
old
story
about
seager
was
dying
out
you
see
but
ord
must
have
got
to
hear
about
it
or
i
always
supposed
so
at
any
rate
in
september
a
dam
hot
september
too
almost
if
not
quite
as
hot
as
this
ord
declined
to
live
here
any
longer
on
what
grounds
he
told
me
a
story
about
his
wife
having
seen
a
man
with
a
contorted
face
peering
in
at
her
bedroom
window
i
questioned
the
woman
of
course
and
she
swore
to
it
he
mopped
his
heated
brow
excitedly
and
burnt
several
matches
before
he
succeeded
in
relighting
his
cigar
she
tried
to
make
me
believe
that
she
woke
up
and
saw
this
apparition
but
i
bullied
the
truth
out
of
her
and
as
i
expected
the
man
ord
had
come
home
the
worse
for
drink
i
made
up
my
mind
that
the
contorted
face
was
the
face
of
her
drunken
husband
whom
she
had
declined
to
admit
and
who
therefore
had
climbed
the
ivy
to
get
in
at
the
open
window
she
denied
this
of
course
she
denied
it
they
both
did
but
from
evidence
obtained
at
the
in
the
village
i
proved
that
ord
had
returned
home
drunk
that
night
still
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
ponderously
the
people
declined
to
remain
in
the
place
so
what
could
i
do
ord
was
a
good
gardener
and
his
drunken
habits
in
no
way
interfered
with
his
efficiency
he
gained
nothing
out
of
the
matter
except
that
instead
of
keeping
low
fennel
a
fine
house
i
sent
him
to
live
in
one
of
the
valley
cottages
he
lives
there
now
for
he
still
head
gardener
at
the
hall
i
made
an
entry
in
my
notebook
i
must
see
ord
i
said
i
should
agreed
the
major
in
his
loud
voice
you
get
nothing
out
of
him
he
the
most
liar
in
the
county
but
to
continue
the
place
proved
unlettable
all
the
old
stories
were
revived
and
told
that
people
cheerfully
went
two
miles
out
of
their
way
in
order
to
avoid
passing
low
fennel
at
night
when
i
sold
the
hall
and
decided
to
lease
the
place
from
the
new
proprietor
believe
me
it
was
almost
hidden
in
a
wilderness
of
weeds
and
bushes
which
had
grown
up
around
it
by
the
lord
harry
i
do
think
a
living
soul
had
approached
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
house
since
the
day
that
the
ords
quitted
it
but
it
suited
my
purpose
being
inexpensive
to
keep
up
and
by
adding
this
new
wing
i
was
enabled
to
accommodate
such
servants
as
we
required
the
horses
and
the
car
had
to
go
of
course
and
with
them
a
lot
of
my
old
people
but
we
brought
the
housekeeper
and
three
servants
and
when
a
london
firm
had
rebuilt
renovated
decorated
and
so
forth
it
began
to
look
habitable
it
a
charming
place
i
said
with
sincerity
is
it
snapped
the
major
tossing
his
cigar
on
to
a
side
table
and
selecting
a
fresh
one
from
a
large
box
at
his
elbow
help
yourself
the
bottle
near
you
is
it
hullo
what
have
we
here
he
broke
off
cigar
in
hand
as
the
sound
of
footsteps
upon
the
gravel
path
immediately
outside
the
window
became
audible
through
the
cluster
of
roses
peered
a
handsome
face
that
of
a
dark
man
whose
hat
and
loose
tie
lent
him
a
sort
of
artistic
appearance
oh
it
you
wales
cried
the
major
but
without
cordiality
see
you
in
half
an
hour
or
so
little
bit
of
business
in
hand
at
the
moment
marjorie
somewhere
about
all
right
called
the
new
arrival
and
waving
his
hand
passed
on
it
young
aubrey
wales
explained
dale
almost
savagely
biting
the
end
from
his
cigar
son
of
sir
frederick
wales
and
one
of
my
neighbours
he
often
drops
in
mentally
considering
the
major
attitude
certain
rumours
which
had
reached
me
and
the
youth
and
beauty
of
dale
i
concluded
that
the
visits
of
aubrey
wales
were
not
too
welcome
to
my
old
friend
but
he
resumed
in
a
louder
voice
than
ever
it
was
last
night
that
the
fun
began
i
can
make
neither
head
nor
tail
of
it
if
the
blessed
place
is
haunted
why
have
we
seen
nothing
of
the
ghost
during
the
two
months
or
so
we
have
lived
at
low
fennel
the
fact
remains
that
nothing
unusual
happened
until
last
night
it
came
about
owing
to
the
infernal
heat
alson
the
housekeeper
came
down
about
two
intending
so
i
understand
to
get
a
glass
of
cider
from
the
barrel
in
the
cellar
she
could
not
sleep
owing
to
the
heat
and
felt
extremely
thirsty
there
a
queer
sort
of
bend
in
the
stair
i
show
you
in
a
minute
and
as
she
came
down
and
reached
this
bend
she
met
a
man
or
a
thing
who
was
going
up
the
moonlight
was
streaming
in
through
the
window
right
upon
that
corner
of
the
stair
and
the
apparition
stood
fully
revealed
i
gather
that
it
was
that
of
an
almost
naked
man
alson
naturally
is
rather
reticent
on
the
point
but
i
gather
that
the
apparition
was
inadequately
clothed
regarding
the
face
of
the
thing
she
supplies
more
details
addison
the
major
leant
forward
across
the
table
it
was
the
face
of
a
demon
a
contorted
devilish
face
the
eyes
crossed
and
glaring
like
the
eyes
of
a
mad
dog
of
course
the
poor
woman
fainted
dead
away
on
the
spot
she
might
have
died
there
if
it
had
been
for
the
amazing
heat
of
the
night
this
certainly
was
the
cause
of
her
trouble
but
it
also
saved
her
about
three
i
woke
up
in
a
perfect
bath
of
perspiration
i
never
remember
such
a
night
not
even
in
india
and
as
alson
had
done
an
hour
earlier
i
also
started
to
find
a
drink
addison
i
nearly
fell
over
her
as
she
lay
swooning
on
the
stair
he
helped
himself
to
a
liberal
tot
of
whisky
then
squirted
soda
into
the
glass
for
once
in
a
way
i
did
the
right
thing
addison
not
wishing
to
alarm
marjorie
i
knocked
up
one
of
the
maids
and
when
alson
had
somewhat
recovered
gave
her
into
the
girl
charge
i
sat
downstairs
here
in
this
room
until
she
could
see
me
and
then
got
the
particulars
which
i
given
you
i
wired
you
as
soon
as
the
office
was
open
for
i
said
to
myself
the
devilry
has
begun
again
if
marjorie
gets
to
hear
of
it
there
be
hell
to
pay
she
wo
live
in
the
place
he
stood
up
abruptly
as
a
ripple
of
laughter
reached
us
from
the
garden
suppose
we
explore
the
scene
of
the
trouble
he
suggested
moving
toward
the
door
i
thought
in
the
circumstance
our
inspection
might
be
a
hurried
one
therefore
should
you
mind
very
much
if
i
sought
it
out
for
myself
i
said
it
is
my
custom
in
cases
of
the
kind
to
be
alone
if
possible
my
dear
fellow
certainly
my
ramble
concluded
i
will
rejoin
dale
and
yourself
say
on
the
lawn
good
good
cried
the
major
throwing
open
the
door
an
opening
has
been
made
on
the
floor
above
corresponding
with
this
and
communicating
with
the
old
stair
go
where
you
like
find
out
what
you
can
but
remember
not
a
word
to
marjorie
ii
filled
with
the
liveliest
curiosity
i
set
out
to
explore
low
fennel
first
i
directed
my
attention
to
the
exterior
commencing
my
investigations
from
the
front
that
part
of
the
building
on
either
side
of
the
door
was
evidently
of
tudor
date
with
a
jacobean
wing
to
the
west
containing
apartments
overlooking
the
lawn
the
latter
a
georgian
addition
whilst
the
new
east
wing
built
by
major
dale
carried
the
building
out
almost
level
with
the
clump
of
and
into
the
very
heart
of
the
ferns
and
bushes
which
here
grew
densely
there
was
no
way
around
on
this
side
and
not
desiring
to
cross
the
lawn
at
present
i
passed
in
through
the
house
to
the
garden
at
the
back
this
led
me
through
the
northern
part
of
the
building
and
the
quarters
which
appeared
to
be
of
even
greater
age
than
the
front
of
the
house
the
fine
old
kitchen
in
particular
was
suggestive
of
the
days
when
roasting
was
done
upon
a
grand
scale
beyond
the
flower
garden
lay
the
kitchen
garden
and
beyond
that
the
orchard
the
latter
showed
evidences
of
neglect
bearing
out
the
story
that
the
place
had
been
unoccupied
for
twelve
months
but
it
was
evident
nevertheless
that
the
soil
had
been
cultivated
for
many
generations
thus
far
i
had
discovered
nothing
calculated
to
assist
me
in
my
peculiar
investigation
and
entering
the
house
i
began
a
quest
which
beyond
confirming
most
of
my
earlier
impressions
afforded
little
data
the
tortuous
stairway
which
had
been
the
scene
of
the
event
described
by
my
host
occupied
me
for
some
time
and
i
carefully
examined
the
panels
and
tested
each
separate
stair
for
in
houses
like
low
fennel
secret
passages
and
were
to
be
looked
for
however
i
discovered
nothing
but
descending
again
to
the
hall
i
made
a
small
discovery
there
were
rooms
in
low
fennel
which
one
entered
by
descending
or
ascending
two
or
three
steps
but
this
was
entirely
characteristic
of
the
architectural
methods
of
the
period
represented
i
was
surprised
however
to
find
that
one
mounted
three
steps
in
order
to
obtain
access
to
the
passage
leading
to
the
new
wing
i
had
overlooked
this
peculiarity
hitherto
but
now
it
struck
me
as
worthy
of
attention
why
should
a
modern
architect
introduce
such
a
device
it
could
only
mean
that
the
ground
was
higher
on
the
east
side
of
the
building
and
that
for
some
reason
it
had
proved
more
convenient
to
adopt
the
existing
foundations
than
to
level
the
site
i
returned
to
the
and
stood
there
deep
in
thought
when
the
contact
of
a
rough
tongue
with
my
hand
drew
my
attention
to
a
young
airedale
terrier
who
was
anxious
to
make
my
acquaintance
i
patted
his
head
encouragingly
and
having
reviewed
the
notes
made
during
my
tour
of
inspection
determined
to
repeat
the
tour
in
order
to
check
them
the
airedale
accompanied
me
behaving
himself
with
admirable
propriety
as
we
passed
around
the
house
and
then
out
through
the
kitchens
into
the
garden
it
was
not
until
my
journey
led
me
back
to
the
three
steps
communicating
with
the
new
wing
that
my
companion
seemed
disposed
to
desert
me
at
first
i
ascribed
his
attitude
to
mere
canine
caprice
but
when
he
persistently
refused
to
be
encouraged
i
began
to
ascribe
it
to
something
else
suddenly
grasping
him
by
the
collar
i
dragged
him
up
the
steps
along
the
corridor
and
into
the
major
study
the
result
was
extraordinary
i
think
i
have
never
seen
a
dog
in
quite
the
same
condition
he
whimpered
and
whined
most
piteously
at
the
door
he
struggled
furiously
and
even
tried
to
snap
at
my
hand
then
as
i
still
kept
a
firm
grip
upon
him
he
set
out
upon
a
series
of
howls
which
must
have
been
audible
for
miles
around
finally
i
released
him
having
first
closed
the
study
door
and
lowered
the
window
what
followed
was
really
amazing
the
airedale
hurled
himself
upon
the
closed
door
scratching
at
it
furiously
with
intermittent
howling
then
crouching
down
he
turned
his
eyes
upon
me
with
a
look
in
them
not
savage
but
truly
piteous
seeing
that
i
did
not
move
the
dog
began
to
whimper
again
when
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
as
it
seemed
he
bounded
across
the
room
and
went
crashing
through
the
glass
of
the
closed
window
into
the
rose
bushes
leaving
me
standing
looking
after
him
in
blank
wonderment
iii
aubrey
wales
stayed
to
dinner
and
since
he
had
no
opportunity
of
dressing
his
presence
afforded
a
welcome
excuse
for
the
other
members
of
the
party
the
night
was
appallingly
hot
the
temperature
being
such
as
to
preclude
the
slightest
exertion
the
major
was
an
excellent
host
but
i
could
see
that
the
presence
of
the
younger
man
irritated
him
and
at
times
the
conversation
grew
strained
there
was
an
uncomfortable
tension
so
that
altogether
i
was
not
sorry
when
dale
left
the
table
and
the
quartet
was
broken
up
on
closer
acquaintance
i
perceived
that
wales
was
even
younger
than
i
had
supposed
and
therefore
i
was
the
more
inclined
to
condone
his
infatuation
for
the
society
of
dale
although
i
felt
less
sympathetically
disposed
toward
her
for
offering
him
the
encouragement
which
rather
openly
she
did
ere
long
wales
left
major
dale
and
myself
for
the
more
congenial
society
of
the
hostess
so
that
shortly
afterwards
when
the
major
who
took
at
least
as
much
wine
as
was
good
for
him
began
to
doze
in
his
chair
i
found
myself
left
to
my
own
devices
i
quitted
the
room
quietly
without
disturbing
my
host
and
strolled
around
on
to
the
lawn
smoking
a
cigarette
and
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
matters
responsible
for
my
presence
at
low
fennel
with
no
definite
object
in
view
i
had
wandered
towards
the
orchard
when
i
became
aware
of
a
whispered
conversation
taking
place
somewhere
near
me
punctuated
with
little
peals
of
laughter
i
detected
the
words
aubrey
and
marjorie
dale
name
and
impatiently
tossing
my
cigarette
away
i
returned
to
the
house
intent
upon
arousing
the
major
and
terminating
this
that
it
was
more
on
part
than
a
harmless
flirtation
i
did
not
believe
but
young
wales
was
not
a
safe
type
of
man
for
that
sort
of
amusement
the
major
sunk
deep
in
his
favourite
chair
in
the
study
was
snoring
loudly
and
as
i
stood
contemplating
him
in
the
dusk
i
changed
my
mind
and
retracing
my
steps
joined
the
two
in
the
orchard
proclaiming
my
arrival
by
humming
a
popular
melody
has
he
fallen
asleep
asked
dale
turning
laughing
eyes
upon
me
i
studied
the
piquant
face
ere
replying
her
tone
and
her
expression
had
reassured
me
if
further
assurance
were
necessary
that
my
old
heart
was
in
safe
keeping
but
she
was
young
and
gay
it
was
a
case
for
diplomatic
handling
india
leaves
its
mark
on
all
men
i
replied
lightly
but
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
major
is
enough
now
my
words
were
an
invitation
to
which
i
was
glad
to
note
she
responded
readily
enough
let
come
and
dig
him
out
of
that
cavern
of
his
she
said
and
linking
her
right
arm
in
that
of
wales
and
her
left
with
mine
she
turned
us
about
toward
the
house
dusk
was
now
fallen
and
lights
shone
out
from
several
windows
of
low
fennel
suddenly
an
upper
window
became
illuminated
and
dale
pointed
to
this
that
is
my
room
she
said
to
me
is
it
delightfully
situated
the
view
from
the
window
is
glorious
i
consider
low
fennel
charming
in
every
way
i
replied
clearly
she
knew
nothing
of
the
place
sinister
reputation
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
she
employed
herself
little
with
the
domestic
side
of
the
household
otherwise
she
must
undoubtedly
have
learnt
of
the
episode
of
the
man
with
the
contorted
face
if
not
from
the
housekeeper
from
the
maid
it
was
a
tribute
to
the
reticence
of
the
servants
that
the
story
had
spread
no
further
but
the
broken
study
window
and
the
sadly
damaged
airedale
already
afforded
matter
for
whispered
debate
among
them
as
i
had
noted
with
displeasure
the
digging
out
of
the
major
did
not
prove
to
be
an
entire
success
he
was
in
one
of
his
peculiar
moods
which
i
knew
of
old
and
rather
surly
being
pointedly
rude
on
more
than
one
occasion
to
wales
he
had
some
accounts
to
look
into
or
professed
to
have
and
the
three
of
us
presently
left
him
alone
it
was
now
about
ten
and
aubrey
wales
made
his
departure
shaking
me
warmly
by
the
hand
and
expressing
the
hope
that
we
should
see
more
of
one
another
he
could
not
foresee
that
the
wish
was
to
be
realised
in
a
curious
fashion
dale
informed
me
that
the
major
in
all
probability
would
remain
immured
in
his
study
until
a
late
hour
which
i
took
to
be
an
intimation
that
she
wished
to
retire
i
therefore
pleaded
weariness
as
a
result
of
my
journey
and
went
up
to
my
room
although
i
had
no
intention
of
i
opened
the
two
windows
widely
and
the
heavy
perfume
of
some
kind
of
tobacco
plant
growing
in
the
beds
below
grew
almost
oppressive
the
heat
of
the
night
was
truly
phenomenal
i
might
have
been
not
in
an
english
home
county
but
in
the
soudan
an
absolute
stillness
reigned
throughout
low
fennel
and
my
hearing
being
peculiarly
acute
i
could
detect
the
chirping
of
the
bats
which
flitted
restlessly
past
my
windows
it
was
difficult
to
decide
how
to
act
my
experience
of
supernatural
appearances
had
strengthened
my
faith
in
the
theory
set
forth
in
the
paper
chemistry
of
psychic
phenomena
which
had
attracted
unexpected
attention
a
year
before
therein
i
classified
hauntings
under
several
heads
basing
my
conclusions
upon
the
fact
that
such
apparitions
are
invariably
localised
often
being
confined
not
merely
to
a
particular
room
for
instance
but
to
a
certain
wall
door
or
window
i
had
been
privileged
to
visit
most
of
the
famous
haunted
homes
of
great
britain
and
this
paper
was
the
result
but
in
the
case
of
low
fennel
i
found
myself
nonplussed
largely
owing
to
lack
of
data
i
hoped
on
the
morrow
to
make
certain
inquiries
along
lines
suggested
by
oddities
in
the
structure
of
the
house
itself
and
by
the
nature
of
the
little
valley
in
which
it
stood
when
meditating
i
never
sit
still
and
whilst
marshalling
my
ideas
i
paced
the
room
from
end
to
end
smoking
the
whole
time
both
windows
and
also
the
door
were
widely
opened
the
amazing
which
we
were
then
experiencing
promised
to
afford
me
a
valuable
clue
for
i
had
proved
to
my
own
satisfaction
that
the
apparitions
variously
known
as
controls
and
elementals
not
infrequently
coincided
with
abrupt
climatic
changes
or
heat
waves
or
with
natural
phenomena
such
as
landslides
and
the
like
this
pacing
led
me
from
end
to
end
of
the
room
then
between
the
open
door
and
the
large
facing
it
it
was
as
i
returned
from
the
door
towards
the
that
i
became
aware
of
the
presence
of
the
my
peculiar
studies
had
brought
me
into
contact
with
many
horrible
apparitions
and
if
familiarity
had
failed
to
breed
contempt
at
least
it
had
served
to
train
my
nerves
for
the
reception
of
such
sudden
and
ghastly
appearances
i
should
be
avoiding
the
truth
however
if
i
claimed
to
have
been
unmoved
by
the
vision
which
now
met
me
in
the
mirror
i
drew
up
short
with
one
sibilant
breath
and
then
stood
transfixed
before
me
was
a
reflection
of
the
open
door
and
of
part
of
the
landing
and
stairs
beyond
it
the
landing
lights
were
extinguished
and
therefore
the
place
beyond
the
door
lay
in
comparative
darkness
but
crawling
in
inch
by
inch
silently
intently
so
that
the
head
throat
and
hands
were
actually
across
the
threshold
came
a
creature
which
seemed
to
be
entirely
naked
it
had
the
form
of
a
man
but
the
face
the
dreadful
face
which
was
being
pushed
forward
slowly
across
the
carpet
with
head
held
sideways
so
that
one
ear
all
but
touched
the
floor
was
the
face
not
of
a
man
but
of
a
ghoul
i
clenched
my
teeth
hard
staring
into
the
mirror
and
trying
to
force
myself
to
turn
and
confront
not
the
reflection
but
the
reality
yet
for
many
seconds
i
was
unable
to
accomplish
this
the
baleful
protruding
eyes
glared
straight
into
mine
from
the
glass
the
chin
and
lower
lip
of
this
awful
face
seemed
to
be
drawn
up
so
as
almost
to
meet
the
nose
entirely
covering
the
upper
lip
and
the
nostrils
were
distended
to
an
incredible
degree
whilst
the
skin
had
a
sort
of
purple
tinge
unlike
anything
i
had
seen
before
the
effect
was
grotesque
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
for
the
thing
was
clearly
grimacing
at
me
yet
god
knows
there
was
nothing
humorous
in
that
grimace
nearer
it
came
and
nearer
i
could
hear
the
heavy
body
being
drawn
across
the
floor
i
could
hear
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
and
i
could
hear
a
whispered
conversation
which
seemed
to
be
taking
place
somewhere
immediately
outside
my
room
at
the
moment
that
i
detected
the
latter
sound
it
seemed
that
the
apparition
detected
it
also
the
protruding
eyes
twisted
in
the
head
rolling
around
ridiculously
but
horribly
despite
the
dread
which
held
me
i
identified
the
whisperers
and
located
their
situation
dale
was
at
her
open
window
and
aubrey
wales
was
in
the
garden
below
the
thought
crossed
my
mind
and
was
gone
but
gone
no
quicker
than
the
contorted
face
by
a
sort
of
backward
serpentine
movement
the
thing
which
had
been
crawling
into
my
room
suddenly
retired
and
was
swallowed
up
in
the
shadows
of
the
landing
i
turned
and
sprang
toward
the
open
door
the
fever
of
research
hot
upon
me
and
my
nerves
in
hand
again
at
the
door
i
paused
and
listened
intently
no
sound
came
to
guide
me
from
the
darkened
stair
and
when
stepping
quietly
forward
and
leaning
over
the
rail
i
peered
down
into
the
hall
below
nothing
stirred
no
shadow
of
the
many
there
moved
to
tell
of
the
passage
of
any
living
thing
i
paused
irresolute
unable
to
doubt
that
i
was
in
the
presence
of
an
authentic
apparition
but
how
to
classify
it
slowly
i
returned
to
my
room
and
stood
there
thinking
hard
and
all
the
while
listening
for
the
slightest
sound
from
within
or
without
the
house
the
whispered
conversation
continued
and
i
stole
quietly
to
one
of
the
windows
and
leant
out
looking
to
the
left
in
the
direction
of
the
new
wing
a
light
burnt
in
the
major
study
whereby
i
concluded
that
he
was
still
engaged
with
his
accounts
if
he
had
not
fallen
asleep
between
my
window
and
the
new
wing
and
on
a
level
with
my
eyes
was
the
window
of
dale
room
and
in
the
bright
moonlight
i
could
see
her
leaning
out
her
elbows
on
the
ledge
her
bare
arms
gleamed
like
marble
in
the
cold
light
and
she
looked
statuesquely
beautiful
wales
i
could
not
see
for
a
thick
hedge
obstructed
my
view
but
i
saw
something
else
lizard
fashion
a
hideous
unclad
shape
crawled
past
beneath
me
amongst
the
tangle
of
ivy
and
low
plants
about
the
foot
of
the
fir
trees
the
moonlight
touched
it
for
a
moment
and
then
it
was
gone
into
denser
shadows
a
consciousness
of
impending
disaster
came
to
me
but
because
of
its
very
vagueness
found
me
unprepared
then
suddenly
i
saw
young
wales
he
sprang
into
view
above
the
hedge
against
which
i
presume
he
had
been
crouching
he
leapt
high
in
the
air
as
though
from
some
menace
on
the
ground
beneath
him
i
have
never
heard
a
more
horrifying
scream
than
that
which
he
uttered
my
god
he
cried
marjorie
marjorie
and
yet
again
marjorie
me
then
he
was
down
still
screaming
horribly
and
calling
on
the
woman
for
aid
as
though
she
could
have
aided
him
the
crawling
thing
made
no
sound
but
the
dreadful
screams
of
wales
sank
slowly
into
a
sort
of
sobbing
and
then
into
a
significant
panting
which
told
of
his
dire
extremity
i
raced
out
of
the
room
and
down
the
dark
stair
into
the
hall
everywhere
i
was
met
by
locked
doors
which
baffled
me
i
had
hoped
to
reach
the
garden
by
way
of
the
kitchens
but
now
i
changed
my
plan
and
turned
my
attention
to
the
it
was
bolted
but
i
drew
the
bolts
one
after
the
other
and
got
the
door
open
outside
the
landscape
was
bathed
in
glorious
moonlight
and
a
sort
of
grey
mist
hovered
over
the
valley
like
smoke
i
ran
around
the
angle
of
the
house
on
to
the
lawn
and
went
plunging
through
heedlessly
to
the
scene
of
the
incredible
conflict
i
almost
fell
over
wales
as
he
lay
inert
upon
the
gravel
path
the
shadows
veiled
him
so
that
i
could
not
see
his
face
but
when
groping
with
my
hands
i
sought
to
learn
if
his
heart
still
pulsed
i
failed
to
discover
any
evidence
that
it
did
with
my
hand
thrust
against
his
breast
and
my
ear
lowered
anxiously
i
listened
but
he
gave
no
sign
of
life
lying
as
still
as
all
else
around
me
now
this
stillness
was
broken
excited
voices
became
audible
and
doors
were
being
unlocked
here
and
there
first
of
all
the
household
dale
appeared
enveloped
in
a
lace
aubrey
she
cried
tremulously
what
is
it
where
are
you
he
is
here
dale
i
answered
standing
up
and
in
a
bad
way
i
fear
for
heaven
sake
what
has
happened
to
him
did
you
hear
his
awful
cries
i
did
i
said
shortly
standing
with
the
moonlight
fully
upon
her
dale
sought
him
in
the
shadows
of
the
hedge
and
i
knew
that
by
the
manner
of
his
frightened
outcry
the
man
lying
unconscious
at
my
feet
had
forfeited
whatever
of
her
regard
he
had
enjoyed
she
was
dreadfully
alarmed
not
so
much
on
his
behalf
as
by
the
mystery
of
the
attack
upon
him
but
now
she
composed
herself
though
not
without
visible
effort
where
is
he
mr
addison
she
said
firmly
and
what
has
happened
to
him
a
man
who
proved
to
be
a
gardener
now
appeared
upon
the
scene
help
me
to
carry
him
in
i
said
to
this
new
arrival
perhaps
he
has
only
fainted
we
gathered
up
the
recumbent
body
and
carried
it
through
the
kitchens
into
the
where
there
was
a
deep
couch
all
the
servants
were
gathered
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
frightened
and
useless
but
the
outcry
did
not
seem
to
have
aroused
major
dale
dale
and
i
bent
over
wales
his
face
was
frightfully
congested
whilst
his
tongue
protruded
hideously
and
it
was
evident
from
the
great
discoloured
weals
which
now
were
coming
up
upon
his
throat
that
he
had
been
strangled
or
nearly
so
i
glanced
at
the
white
face
of
my
hostess
and
then
bent
over
the
victim
examining
him
more
carefully
i
stood
upright
again
do
you
know
first
aid
mrs
dale
i
asked
abruptly
she
nodded
her
eyes
fixed
intently
upon
me
then
help
to
employ
artificial
respiration
i
said
and
let
one
of
the
girls
get
ammonia
if
you
have
any
and
a
bowl
of
hot
water
we
can
patch
him
up
i
think
without
medical
aid
which
might
be
undesirable
dale
seemed
fully
to
appreciate
the
point
and
in
fashion
set
to
work
to
assist
me
wales
had
just
opened
his
eyes
and
begun
to
clutch
at
his
agonized
throat
when
i
heard
a
heavy
step
descending
from
the
new
wing
and
major
dale
in
his
joined
us
his
red
face
was
more
red
than
usual
and
his
eyes
were
round
with
wonder
what
the
devil
the
matter
he
cried
what
everybody
up
for
there
has
been
an
accident
major
i
said
glancing
around
at
the
servants
who
stood
in
a
group
by
the
door
of
the
i
can
explain
more
fully
later
major
dale
stepped
forward
and
looked
down
at
wales
good
god
he
said
hoarsely
it
young
wales
by
the
lord
harry
what
he
doing
here
dale
standing
just
behind
me
laid
her
hand
upon
my
arm
and
unseen
by
the
major
i
turned
and
pressed
it
reassuringly
iv
the
following
day
i
lunched
alone
with
the
major
dale
being
absent
on
a
visit
it
had
been
impossible
to
keep
the
truth
from
her
or
what
we
knew
of
it
and
at
present
i
could
not
quite
foresee
the
issue
of
last
night
affair
young
wales
who
had
been
driven
home
in
a
car
sent
from
his
place
at
a
late
hour
had
not
since
put
in
an
appearance
and
it
was
sufficiently
evident
that
dale
would
not
welcome
him
should
he
do
so
the
hysterical
panic
which
he
had
exhibited
on
the
previous
night
having
disgusted
her
she
had
not
said
so
in
as
many
words
but
i
did
not
doubt
it
well
addison
said
the
major
as
i
entered
have
you
got
the
facts
you
were
looking
for
some
of
them
i
replied
and
opening
my
notebook
i
turned
to
the
pages
containing
notes
made
that
morning
the
major
watched
me
with
intense
curiosity
and
almost
impatiently
awaited
my
next
words
the
servant
having
left
the
room
in
the
first
place
i
began
glancing
at
the
notes
i
have
been
consulting
certain
local
records
in
the
town
and
i
find
that
in
the
year
a
certain
dame
pryce
occupied
a
cabin
which
according
to
one
record
close
beside
unto
ye
lowe
fennel
that
is
close
beside
this
house
interjected
the
major
excitedly
exactly
i
said
she
attracted
the
attention
of
one
of
the
many
infamous
wretches
who
disfigure
the
history
of
that
period
matthew
hopkins
the
general
this
was
a
age
and
the
man
hopkins
was
one
of
those
who
fattened
on
the
credulity
of
his
fellows
receiving
a
fee
of
twenty
shillings
for
every
unhappy
woman
discovered
and
convicted
of
witchcraft
poor
pryce
was
in
a
local
pond
a
test
whereby
the
villain
hopkins
professed
to
discover
if
the
woman
were
one
of
satan
band
or
otherwise
and
burnt
alive
in
reigate
on
september
by
god
said
the
major
who
had
not
attempted
to
commence
his
lunch
that
a
horrible
story
it
is
one
of
the
many
to
the
credit
of
matthew
hopkins
i
replied
but
without
boring
you
with
the
details
of
this
woman
examination
and
so
forth
i
may
say
that
what
interests
me
most
in
the
case
is
the
date
september
why
i
do
follow
you
well
i
said
there
a
hiatus
in
the
history
of
the
place
after
that
except
that
even
in
those
early
days
it
evidently
suffered
from
the
reputation
of
being
haunted
but
without
troubling
about
the
interval
consider
the
case
of
seager
which
you
yourself
related
to
me
was
it
not
in
the
month
of
august
that
he
was
done
to
death
here
by
gad
cried
the
major
his
face
growing
redder
than
ever
you
right
and
hang
it
all
addison
it
was
in
september
last
september
that
the
ords
cleared
out
i
remember
your
mentioning
i
continued
smiling
at
his
excitement
that
it
was
a
very
hot
month
it
was
from
a
mere
word
dropped
by
one
of
the
witnesses
at
the
trial
of
poor
pryce
i
have
gathered
that
the
month
in
which
she
was
convicted
of
practising
witchcraft
in
her
cabin
adjoining
low
fennel
as
it
stood
in
those
days
was
a
tropically
hot
month
also
major
dale
stared
at
me
uncomprehendingly
i
out
of
my
depth
addison
wading
hopelessly
what
the
devil
has
the
heat
to
do
with
the
haunting
to
my
mind
everything
i
may
be
wrong
but
i
think
that
if
the
glass
were
to
fall
there
would
be
no
repetition
of
the
trouble
you
mean
that
it
only
in
very
hot
weather
in
phenomenally
hot
weather
major
the
sort
that
we
only
get
in
england
perhaps
once
in
every
ten
years
for
the
glass
to
reach
the
altitude
at
which
it
stands
at
present
in
two
successive
summers
is
quite
phenomenal
as
you
know
it
phenomenal
for
it
to
reach
that
point
at
all
said
the
major
mopping
his
perspiring
forehead
it
simply
indian
simply
indian
sir
by
the
lord
harry
another
inquiry
i
continued
turning
over
a
leaf
of
my
book
i
have
been
unable
to
complete
since
in
order
to
interview
the
people
who
built
your
new
wing
i
should
have
to
run
up
to
london
what
the
blazes
have
they
to
do
with
it
nothing
at
all
but
i
should
have
liked
to
learn
their
reasons
for
raising
the
wing
three
feet
above
the
level
of
the
between
the
heat
and
his
growing
excitement
major
dale
found
himself
at
a
temporary
loss
for
words
then
they
told
me
he
shouted
at
the
top
of
his
voice
they
told
me
at
the
time
that
it
was
something
about
that
it
was
due
to
the
plan
that
it
was
i
can
imagine
that
they
had
some
ready
explanation
i
said
but
it
may
not
have
been
the
true
one
then
what
the
what
the
is
the
true
one
the
true
one
is
that
the
new
wing
covers
a
former
mound
quite
right
it
does
if
my
theory
is
correct
it
was
upon
this
mound
that
the
cabin
of
dame
pryce
formerly
stood
it
quite
possible
they
used
to
allow
dirty
hovels
to
be
erected
alongside
one
very
walls
in
those
days
quite
possible
moreover
from
what
i
learnt
from
ord
whom
i
interviewed
at
the
hall
and
from
such
accounts
as
are
obtainable
of
the
death
of
seager
this
mound
and
not
the
interior
of
low
fennel
as
it
then
stood
was
the
scene
of
the
apparitions
you
got
me
out
of
my
depth
again
addison
what
mean
seager
was
strangled
outside
the
house
not
inside
i
believe
that
true
agreed
the
major
still
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
but
gradually
growing
hoarser
i
remember
they
found
him
lying
on
the
step
or
something
then
again
the
apparition
with
the
contorted
face
which
peered
in
at
ord
lies
all
lies
i
do
agree
with
you
major
she
was
trying
to
shield
her
husband
but
i
think
she
saw
the
contorted
face
right
enough
at
any
rate
interesting
to
note
that
the
visitant
came
from
outside
the
house
again
but
cried
the
major
banging
his
fist
upon
the
table
it
wanders
about
inside
the
house
and
and
damn
it
all
it
goes
outside
as
well
where
it
goes
i
interrupted
quietly
is
not
the
point
the
point
is
where
it
comes
from
then
where
do
you
believe
it
comes
from
i
believe
the
trouble
arises
in
the
strictest
sense
of
the
word
from
the
same
spot
whence
it
arose
in
the
days
of
matthew
hopkins
and
from
which
it
had
probably
arisen
ages
before
low
fennel
was
built
what
the
i
believe
it
to
arise
from
the
ancient
barrow
or
tumulus
above
which
you
have
had
your
new
wing
erected
major
dale
fell
back
in
his
chair
temporarily
speechless
but
breathing
noisily
then
tumulus
he
said
hoarsely
mean
to
tell
me
the
house
is
built
on
a
dam
burial
ground
not
the
whole
house
i
corrected
him
only
the
new
wing
then
is
the
place
haunted
by
the
spirit
of
some
uneasy
ancient
briton
or
something
of
that
sort
addison
hang
it
all
you
ca
tell
me
a
fairy
tale
like
that
a
ghost
going
back
to
days
is
a
bit
too
ancient
for
me
my
boy
too
hoary
by
the
lord
harry
i
have
said
nothing
about
an
ancient
british
ghost
you
flying
off
at
a
tangent
hang
it
all
addison
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
at
all
but
nevertheless
your
hints
are
sufficiently
unpleasant
a
tumulus
no
man
likes
to
know
he
sleeping
in
a
graveyard
not
even
if
it
is
two
or
three
thousand
years
old
think
the
chap
who
surveyed
the
ground
for
me
knew
of
it
by
the
fact
that
he
planned
the
new
wing
so
as
to
avoid
excavation
i
think
probably
he
did
he
was
wise
enough
to
surmise
that
the
order
might
be
cancelled
altogether
and
the
job
lost
if
you
learnt
the
history
of
the
mound
adjoining
your
walls
a
barrow
under
the
study
floor
groaned
the
major
damn
it
all
have
the
place
pulled
down
i
wo
live
in
it
gad
if
marjorie
knew
she
would
never
close
her
eyes
under
the
roof
of
low
fennel
again
sure
she
would
i
know
she
would
but
what
more
addison
the
thing
whatever
it
is
is
dangerous
infernally
dangerous
it
nearly
killed
young
wales
he
added
with
a
complacency
which
was
significant
it
was
the
fright
that
nearly
killed
him
i
said
shortly
major
dale
stared
across
the
table
at
me
for
god
sake
addison
he
said
what
does
it
mean
what
unholy
thing
haunts
low
fennel
you
studied
these
beastly
subjects
and
i
rely
upon
you
to
make
the
place
clean
and
good
to
live
in
again
major
i
replied
i
doubt
if
low
fennel
will
ever
be
fit
to
live
in
at
any
time
an
abnormal
rise
of
temperature
might
produce
the
most
dreadful
results
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
if
you
care
to
have
the
new
wing
pulled
down
and
the
wall
bricked
up
again
if
you
care
to
keep
all
your
doors
and
windows
fastened
securely
whenever
the
thermometer
begins
to
exhibit
signs
of
rising
if
you
avoid
going
out
on
hot
nights
after
dusk
as
you
would
avoid
the
plague
yes
it
may
be
possible
to
live
in
low
fennel
again
the
major
became
speechless
but
finally
what
mean
addison
he
whispered
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
is
it
what
is
it
it
is
what
some
students
have
labelled
an
and
some
a
i
replied
it
is
something
older
than
the
house
older
perhaps
than
the
very
hills
something
which
may
never
be
classified
something
as
old
as
the
root
of
all
evil
and
it
dwells
in
the
ancient
british
tumulus
v
as
i
had
hoped
for
my
plans
were
dependent
upon
it
the
mercury
towered
steadily
throughout
that
day
and
showed
no
signs
of
falling
at
night
the
phenomenal
continued
uninterruptedly
the
household
was
late
retiring
for
the
grey
lord
fear
had
imposed
his
will
upon
all
within
it
every
shadow
in
the
rambling
old
building
became
a
cavern
of
horrors
every
sound
that
disturbed
the
ancient
timbers
a
portent
and
a
warning
that
the
servants
proposed
to
leave
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
was
perfectly
evident
to
me
in
a
word
all
the
dark
old
stories
which
had
grown
up
around
low
fennel
were
revived
and
garnished
and
new
ones
added
to
them
the
horror
of
the
night
before
had
left
its
mark
upon
every
one
and
the
coming
of
dusk
brought
with
it
such
a
dread
as
could
almost
be
felt
in
the
very
atmosphere
of
the
place
ghostly
figures
seemed
to
stir
the
hangings
ghostly
sighs
to
sound
from
every
nook
of
the
old
hall
and
stairway
baleful
eyes
looked
in
at
the
open
windows
and
the
shrubberies
were
peopled
with
hosts
of
nameless
things
who
whispered
together
in
evil
counsel
dale
was
as
loath
to
retire
as
were
the
servants
more
especially
since
the
major
and
i
were
unable
to
disguise
from
her
our
intention
of
watching
for
the
strange
visitant
that
night
but
finally
we
prevailed
upon
her
to
depart
and
she
ran
upstairs
as
though
the
legions
of
the
lost
pursued
her
slamming
and
locking
her
door
so
that
the
sound
echoed
all
over
the
house
we
had
told
her
nothing
of
course
of
my
discoveries
and
theories
but
nevertheless
the
cat
was
out
of
the
bag
the
affair
of
the
night
before
had
spoilt
our
scheme
of
secrecy
in
the
major
study
we
made
our
preparations
the
windows
were
widely
opened
and
the
door
was
ajar
not
a
breath
of
wind
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
night
and
although
major
dale
had
agreed
to
act
exactly
as
i
might
direct
he
stared
in
almost
comic
surprise
when
he
learnt
the
nature
of
these
directions
placing
two
large
silk
handkerchiefs
upon
the
table
i
saturated
them
with
the
contents
of
a
bottle
which
i
had
brought
in
my
pocket
and
handed
one
of
the
handkerchiefs
to
him
tie
that
over
your
mouth
and
nostrils
i
said
and
whatever
happens
do
remove
it
unless
i
tell
you
but
addison
you
know
the
compact
major
if
you
are
prepared
to
assist
i
must
ask
you
to
retire
might
be
the
last
chance
perhaps
for
years
growling
beneath
his
breath
major
dale
obeyed
and
a
humorous
figure
enough
stretched
himself
upon
the
couch
staring
at
me
i
also
fastened
a
handkerchief
about
my
head
it
would
perhaps
be
better
i
said
my
voice
dimmed
by
the
wet
silk
if
we
avoided
conversation
as
much
as
possible
standing
up
i
rolled
back
a
corner
of
the
carpet
exposing
the
and
with
a
which
i
had
in
my
pocket
i
bored
a
round
hole
in
one
of
these
into
it
i
screwed
the
tube
attached
to
a
little
contrivance
twisting
the
face
of
the
dial
so
that
i
could
study
it
from
where
i
proposed
to
sit
then
i
took
up
my
post
smothering
a
laugh
as
i
noted
the
expression
upon
that
part
of
the
major
red
face
which
was
visible
to
me
thus
began
the
business
of
that
strange
night
half
an
hour
passed
in
almost
complete
silence
save
for
the
audible
breathing
of
the
major
by
no
means
an
ideal
companion
for
such
an
investigation
but
having
agreed
to
assist
me
in
justice
to
my
old
friend
i
must
say
that
he
did
his
best
to
stick
to
the
bargain
and
to
play
his
part
in
what
obviously
he
regarded
as
an
insane
comedy
at
about
the
expiration
of
this
thirty
minutes
i
thought
i
heard
a
door
open
somewhere
in
the
house
listening
intently
and
glancing
at
my
companion
i
received
no
confirmation
of
the
idea
evidently
the
major
had
heard
nothing
again
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
the
rustling
of
silk
upon
the
stair
or
in
an
upper
corridor
finally
i
was
almost
certain
that
the
floor
of
the
room
above
viz
the
major
bedroom
creaked
very
slightly
at
that
i
saw
my
companion
glance
upward
then
across
at
me
with
a
question
in
his
eyes
but
not
desiring
to
disturb
the
silence
i
merely
shook
my
head
an
hour
passed
there
had
been
no
repetition
of
the
slight
sounds
to
which
i
have
referred
and
the
stillness
of
low
fennel
was
really
extraordinary
a
thermometer
which
i
had
placed
upon
the
table
near
to
my
elbow
recorded
the
fact
that
the
temperature
of
the
room
had
not
abated
a
fraction
of
a
point
since
sunset
and
sitting
still
though
i
was
i
found
myself
bathed
in
perspiration
despite
the
open
door
and
windows
not
a
breath
of
air
stirred
in
the
place
but
the
room
was
laden
with
the
oppressive
perfume
of
those
flowers
which
i
have
mentioned
elsewhere
for
it
was
faintly
perceptible
to
me
despite
the
wet
silk
once
a
bat
flew
half
in
at
one
of
the
windows
striking
its
wings
upon
the
glass
but
almost
immediately
it
flew
out
again
a
big
moth
fluttered
around
the
room
persistently
banging
its
wings
against
the
but
nothing
else
within
or
without
the
house
stirred
if
i
except
the
occasional
restless
movements
of
the
major
then
all
at
once
and
not
gradually
as
i
had
anticipated
the
meter
at
my
feet
began
to
register
instantly
i
looked
to
the
thermometer
it
had
begun
to
fall
i
glanced
across
at
major
dale
he
was
staring
at
something
which
seemed
to
have
attracted
his
attention
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
room
glancing
away
from
the
meter
the
indicator
of
which
was
still
moving
upward
i
looked
in
the
same
direction
there
was
much
shadow
there
but
nevertheless
i
could
not
doubt
that
a
very
faint
vapour
was
forming
in
that
corner
rising
rising
rising
slowly
higher
and
higher
it
proceeded
from
some
part
of
the
floor
concealed
by
the
big
chair
the
major
favourite
probably
from
a
faulty
and
it
was
rising
visibly
inch
upon
inch
as
i
watched
until
it
touched
the
ceiling
above
then
like
a
column
of
smoke
it
spread
out
mushroom
fashion
it
crept
in
ghostly
coils
along
the
cornices
spreading
a
dim
grey
haze
until
it
obscured
a
great
part
of
the
ceiling
again
i
looked
across
at
the
major
he
was
staring
at
the
phenomenon
with
eyes
which
were
glassy
with
amazement
i
could
see
that
momentarily
he
expected
the
vapour
to
take
shape
to
form
into
some
ghoulish
thing
with
a
contorted
face
and
clutching
outstretched
fingers
but
this
did
not
happen
the
vapour
which
was
growing
more
fine
and
imperceptible
began
to
disperse
i
glanced
from
corner
to
corner
of
the
room
then
down
to
the
meter
on
the
floor
the
indicator
was
falling
again
still
i
made
no
move
although
i
could
hear
major
dale
fidgeting
nervously
but
i
looked
across
at
him
and
a
dreadful
change
had
come
over
his
face
he
was
sitting
upright
upon
the
couch
the
edge
of
which
he
clutched
with
one
hand
whilst
with
the
other
he
combed
the
air
in
a
gesture
evidently
meant
to
attract
my
attention
he
was
trying
to
speak
but
only
a
guttural
sound
issued
from
his
throat
his
staring
eyes
were
set
in
a
glare
of
stark
horror
upon
the
door
of
the
study
swiftly
i
turned
to
see
the
door
slowly
opening
to
see
low
down
upon
the
bare
floor
for
i
had
removed
the
carpet
from
that
corner
of
the
room
a
ghastly
contorted
face
held
sideways
with
one
ear
almost
touching
the
ground
and
with
the
lower
lip
and
the
chin
drawn
up
as
though
they
were
of
rubber
almost
to
the
tip
of
the
nose
the
eyes
glared
up
balefully
into
mine
the
hair
hung
a
dishevelled
mass
about
the
face
and
i
had
a
glimpse
of
one
bare
shoulder
pressed
upon
the
floor
wider
and
wider
opened
the
door
and
further
into
the
room
crept
the
horrible
apparition
the
light
gleamed
equally
upon
the
hideous
contorted
face
and
upon
the
rounded
shoulders
and
slim
white
arms
on
one
of
which
a
heavy
gold
oriental
bangle
was
clasped
it
was
a
woman
in
a
flash
of
inspiration
at
sight
of
the
bangle
my
doubts
were
resolved
leaning
across
the
table
i
extinguished
the
lamp
in
the
same
instant
that
major
dale
uttering
an
inarticulate
choking
cry
sprang
to
his
feet
and
toppled
forward
senseless
upon
the
floor
the
study
became
plunged
in
darkness
but
into
the
long
corridor
beyond
the
open
door
poured
the
cold
illumination
of
the
moon
framed
in
the
portal
uprose
a
slim
figure
seeming
like
a
black
silhouette
upon
a
silvern
background
or
a
wondrous
statue
in
ebony
elfin
dishevelled
locks
crowned
the
head
the
pose
of
the
form
was
as
that
of
a
startled
dryad
or
a
young
bacchante
poised
for
a
joyous
leap
thus
for
an
instant
like
some
exquisite
dream
of
phidias
visualised
the
figure

then
had
fled
away
down
the
corridor

reached
out
for
the
decanter
then
withdrew
his
hand
orders
he
muttered
discipline
must
be
maintained
it
was
the
sudden
excitement
which
precipitated
the
seizure
i
said
glancing
at
the
altered
face
of
my
old
friend
i
was
wrong
to
expose
you
to
it
but
of
course
i
did
not
know
that
the
doctor
had
warned
you
and
now
said
the
major
sighing
loudly
as
he
filled
his
tumbler
with
plain
what
have
you
to
tell
me
in
the
first
place
have
you
definitely
decided
to
leave
low
fennel
for
good
certainly
not
a
doubt
on
the
point
we
leasing
a
flat
in
town
here
whilst
we
look
around
good
because
i
very
much
doubt
if
the
place
could
ever
be
rendered
tenable
then
it
really
haunted
undoubtedly
by
what
addison
tell
me
that
by
what
by
a
grey
vapour

certainly
it
was
not

strangled
by
some
wholly
inoffensive
person
we
shall
probably
never
know
his
identity

amongst

you

i

what
did
wales

and
what
did

you
saw

the

fell
back
in
his
chair
with
an
expression
upon
his
face
which
i
can
not
hope
to
describe
words
failed
him
altogether
i
had
come
prepared
for
something
of
the
sort
i
continued
rapidly
for
i
have
investigated
several
cases
of
haunting
notably
in
the
peak
district
which
have
proved
to
be
due
to
an
emanation
from
the
soil
a
vapour
but
the
effect
of
such
vapour
in
the
other
cases
was
to
induce
delusions
of
sight
in
nearly
every
instance
although
in
two
the
delusions
were
of
hearing
in
other
words
the
person
affected
by
this
vapour
was
drugged
and
during
the
drugged
state
perceived
certain
visions
i
made
the
mistake
at
first
of
supposing
that
low
fennel
came
within
the
same
category
the
classical
analogy
of
course
is
that
of
the
sibyls
who
delivered
the
oracular
responses
from
the
tripod
under
the
afflatus
of
a
vapour
said
to
arise
from
the
sacred
subterranean
stream
called
kassotis
the
theory
is
therefore
by
no
means
a
new
one
major
dale
stared
dully
but
made
no
attempt
to
interrupt
me
there
are
probably
many
spots
in
england
alone
i
continued
thus
affected
but
fortunately
few
of
them
have
been
chosen
as
barrows
and
tumuli
of
the
stone
and
bronze
age
and
also
roman
shrines
seem
frequently
to
be
productive
of
such
emanations
the
barrow
beside
low
fennel
and
now
under
the
new
wing
is
a
case
in
point
sudden
atmospheric
changes
seem
to
be
favourable
to
the
formation
of
the
vapour
the
barrow
in
peel
castle
isle
of
man
is
peculiarly
susceptible
to
for
instance
whilst
that
at
low
fennel
emits
a
vapour
only
after
a
spell
of
intense
heat
and
at
the
exact
moment
when
the
temperature
begins
to
fall
again
in
the
case
of
a
sustained
this
would
take
place
at
some
time
during
each
night
and
now
for
the
particular
in
which
the
vapour
at
low
fennel
differs
from
other
similar
emanations
it
is
not
productive
of
delusions
of
sight
it
induces
a
definite
and
unvarying
form
of
transient
insanity
major
dale
moved
slightly
but
still
did
not
speak
dame
pryce
was
the
first
recorded
victim
of
the
vapour
she
was
accused
of
witchcraft
by
a
neighbour
who
testified
to
having
seen
her
transform
herself
into
a
hideous
and
unrecognizable
hag
whereas
in
her
proper
person
she
seems
to
have
been
a
comely
old
lady
lack
of
evidence
compels
us
to
dismiss
the
case
of
seager
but
consider
that
of
the
ords
the
man
ord
on
his
own
confession
had
fallen
asleep
outside
the
house
he
became
a
victim
of
the
vapour
and
his
own
wife
failed
to
recognize
him
to
what
extent
the
mania
so
produced
is
homicidal
remains
to
be
proved
the
gas
is
rare
and
difficult
to
procure
so
that
hitherto
analysis
has
not
been
attempted
my
own
theory
is
that
the
subject
remains
harmless
provided
that
whilst
under
the
mysterious
influence
he
does
not
encounter
any
person
distasteful
to
him
thus
seager
may
have
met
his
death
at
the
hands
of
some
tramp
who
had
been
turned
away
from
the
house
as
to
the
symptoms
they
seem
to
be
quite
unvarying

out

cases
of

of

the

apparently
returns
to
the
spot
from
whence
he
started
and
sinks
into
profound
sleep
as
is
seen
in
some
cases
of
somnambulism

again
he
acquires
incredible
agility
how

dreadfully
lonely

determined
to
run
along
to
the

which
seemed
a

in

you
came
up

such

upward

beneath

a
panorama
limned
in
feverish
greens
and
unhealthy
yellows
scarlike
rocks
striated
the
jungle
clothing
the
foothills
and
through
the
dancing
air
viewed
from
the
arid
heights

the
appearance
of
running
water

the
muddy

the
bank
of

stream

being
discernible
only
by
reason
of
a
greater
greenness
in
the
venomous
green
slopes
beyond
them
again
a
fringe
of
dwarfed
forest
and
the
brazen
skyline
on
the
right
of
the
path
rose
volcanic
rock
gnarled
twisted
and
contorted
as
with
the
agonies
of
some
mighty
plague
which
in
a
forgotten
past
had
seized
upon
the
very
bowels
of
the
world
and
had
contorted
whole
mountains
and
laid
waste
vast
forests
and
endless
plains
above
the
cruel
sun
ahead
more
rocks
with
sandy
scars
dancing
like

around

breathless
stillness
the
swooning
stillness
of

midday

of

that
silence

accursed

scarcely
support
herself
upright
in
the

her
head
throbbed
incessantly
and
the
veil
which
she
wore
could
not
protect
her
eyes
from
the
maddening
glare
of
the
sun
but
although
at
any
moment
during
the
past
hour
she
could
have
slipped
insensible
from
her
saddle
she
sat
stiffly
upright
her
dauntless
eyes
looking
straight
ahead
her
small
mouth
set
with
masculine
sternness
and
her
hands
clenched
the
physical
reflection
of
the
mental
effort
whereby
alone
she
was
enabled
to
pursue
the
journey
just
in
front
of
her
paced
ramsa
lal
his
stride
had
not
varied
from
the
lowlands
through
the
foothills
nor
on
the
rocky
mountain
paths
he
had
looked
neither
right
nor
left
but
had

walked
at
times

been
hard
put
to
it
to
choke
down
the
hysterical
screams
which
had
risen
in
her
throat
madness
had
threatened
her
as
she
watched
in
dumb
misery
that
silent
striding
man
yet
she
knew
that
it
was
only
the
presence
of
this
tireless
immobile
guide
which
had
enabled
her
to
go
on
although
he
never
directed
one
glance
towards
her
she
knew
that
his
steady
march
was
meant
for
encouragement
behind
like
the
tail
of
a
scorpion
trailed
the
native
retinue
and
on
the
end
of
the
tail
where
the
sting
would
be
rode
her
husband
this
simile
had
occurred
to
her
at
once
and
she
allowed
her
mind
to
dwell
upon
the
idea
as
an
invalid
will
consider
imaginary
designs
upon
the
of
the
sometimes
there
was
a
sliding
of
hoofs
and
a
sound
of
stumbling
sometimes
her
own
pony
lost
his
footing
on
such
occasion
there
would
be
mechanical
cries
of
encouragement
from
the
natives
and
perhaps
a
growling
curse
from
the
man
who
brought
up
the
rear
of
the
little
company
the
road
wound
through
a
frowning
chasm
where
lizards
and
other
creeping
things
darted
into
holes
to
right
and
left
of
their
progress
grateful
shadow
ruled
a
while
and
a
stifled
sigh
escaped
from
moreen
lips
ramsa
lal
paced
straightly
onward
the
others
came
stumbling
behind
fifty
yards
ahead
the
ravine
opened
out
and
once
more
the
deathly
heat
poured
unchecked
upon
their
heads
again
moreen
all
but
lost
control
of
herself
her
fortitude
threatened
to
slip
from
her
so
that
she
bit
her
lips
until
the
pain
filled
her
eyes
with
burning
tears
the
effort
to
control
herself
proved
successful
but
left
her
white
and
quivering
she
felt
impelled
to
speak
to
ramsa
lal
and
constrained
herself
only
with
a
second
effort
of
which
her
will
was
barely
capable
then
she
saw
that
speech
which
would
be
dangerous
was
unnecessary
the
man
wonderful
intuition
had
enabled
him
to
hear
that
crying
of
the
soul
and
he
was
answering
her
his
brown
fingers
were
clutching
and
unclutching
convulsively
and
as
he
swung
his
arm
he
would
clench
his
right
fist
and
beat
the
air
for
a
moment
he
acted
thus
and
then
as
if
he
knew
that
she
had
seen
and
understood
his
fingers
hung
limply
again
and
his
arm
swung
loosely
as
before
a
sort
of
plateau
was
reached
and
in
a
natural
clearing
where
giant
bamboos
ranged
back
to
the
tangled
boughs
of
the
forest
trees
the
voice
of
major
fayne
cried
a
halt
ramsa
lal
was
beside
moreen
pony
in
a
trice
and
he
so
screened
her
exhausted
descent
from
the
saddle
setting
her
down
upon
an
hospitable
bank
hard
by
that
she
was
enabled
to
maintain
her
inflexible
attitude
when
presently
her
husband
came
striding
along
to
stand
looking
down
on
her
where
she
sat
his
blackly
pencilled
brows
were
drawn
together
and
the
pale
blue
eyes
shone
out
saturnine
from
cavernous
sockets
his
handsome
face
was
heavily
lined
and
in
the
appearance
in
the
whole
attitude
of
the
man
was
something
aggressive
a
violence
markedly
repellent
moreen
locked
her
hands
behind
her
the
fingers
twining
and
intertwining
but
she
raised
a
pale
face
to
his
from
which
by
a
last
supreme
effort
of
will
she
had
driven
all
traces
of
emotion
so
they
remained
for
a
moment
whilst
the
servants
busied
themselves
with
the
baggage

with
feet
wide
apart
staring
down
at
her
and
slashing
at
the
air
with
a
and
she
meeting
his
gaze
with
a
stony
calm
pitiful
to
behold

there
been
any

capable
of
pity

see
her

camp
his
voice
would
have
told
a
skilled
observer
that
which
the
facial
lines
and
a
certain
odd
puffiness
of
skin
more
than
suggested
that
major
fayne
was
not
a
temperate
man
moreen
made
no
sign
but
simply
sat
watching
the
speaker
it
a
delightful
situation
continued
he
and
your
ambition
frequently
expressed
in
mandalay
to
see
something
of
burma
other
than
bridge
parties
and
at
last
is
realised
he
spoke
with
a
seeming
sincerity
that
had
carried
conviction
to
any
save
the
most
sceptical
but
moreen
made
no
sign
here
continued
major
fayne
you
may
feast
your
eyes
upon
the
glories
of
a
burma
forest
those
flowering
creepers
yonder
festooned
from
bough
to
bough
are
peculiar
to
this
district
and
if
you
care
to
explore
further
you
will
be
rewarded
by
the
discovery
of
some
fine
orchids
note
also
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
he
twirled
his
slight
moustache
and
turned
away
to
supervise
the
work
of
camping
ramsa
lal
already
had
one
of
the
tents
nearly
erected
and
moreen
watched
his
deft
fingers
at
work
with
an
anxiety
none
the
less
because
it
was
masked
she
knew
that
collapse
was
imminent
the
cruel
march
under
the
pitiless
sun
had
had
due
effect
but
it
had
not
broken
her
spirit
she
knew
that
she
had
reached
the
end
of
her
strength
but
she
showed
no
sign
of
weakness
before
her
husband
it
was
done
at
last
and
ramsa
lal
held
the
aside
and
bowed
moreen
stood
up
clenched
her
teeth
together
grimly
and
staggered
forward
as
the
was
dropped
she
sank
down
beside
the
camp
bedstead
and
her
head
fell
upon
the
covering
ii
dusk
fell
a
quick
curtain
and
the
lamps
of
night
shone
out
with
glorious
brilliancy
illuminating
the
little
plateau
the
tents
gleamed
whitely
in
the
cold
radiance
there
was
a
dancing
redness
to
show
where
the
fire
had
been
built
with
figures
grouped
dimly
around
it
on
a
jagged
rock
which
started
up
from
the
very
heart
of
a
thicket
black
against
the
newly
risen
moon
was
silhouetted
the
figure
of
major
fayne
night
things
swept
the
air
about
him
and
rustled
in
the
cane
brake
below
him
the
fire
crackled
in
the
neighbouring
camp
sometimes
a
murmur
came
from
the
group
of
natives
but
heedless
of
these
matters
moreen
husband
stood
on
the
rocky
eminence
looking
back
upon
the
way
they
had
come
looking
down
to
the
distant
river
valley
for
many
minutes
he
remained
so
but
presently
clambering
down
heavily
forced
his
way
through
the
undergrowth
to
the
little
camp
passing
the
tents
he
walked
back
to
the
dip
of
the
pathway
and
paused
again
watching
and
listening
then
turned
and
strode
to
the
fire
grasped
ramsa
lal
by
the
shoulder
and
drew
him
away
from
the
others
come
here
he
directed
tersely
at
the
head
of
the
pathway
he
bade
him
halt
listen
he
directed
ramsa
lal
stood
in
an
attitude
of
keen
attention
and
the
major
watched
him
with
feverish
anxiety
which
he
was
wholly
unable
to
conceal
do
you
hear
it
he
demanded
hoofs
on
the
path
ramsa
lal
shook
his
head
i
hear
nothing
sahib
put
your
ear
to
the
ground
and
listen
i
tell
you
that
i
saw
figures
moving
away
below
there
and
i
heard
hoofs
stumbling
hoofs
the
man
knelt
down
upon
the
ground
and
bending
forward
lowered
his
head
major
fayne
watched
him
and
with
growing
anxiety
so
that
what
with
this
and
the
pallid
moonlight
his
face
appeared
ghastly
but
again
ramsa
lal
stood
up
shaking
his
head
nothing
sahib
he
repeated
major
fayne
suddenly
grasped
him
by
the
shoulders
spinning
him
about
and
dragging
him
forward
so
that
the
dusky
face
was
but
inches
removed
from
his
own
he
glared
into
the
man
eyes
are
you
lying
to
me
he
demanded
are
you
lying
i
swear
it
is
the
truth
why
should
i
lie
to
you
sahib
you
want
them
major
fayne
broke
off
abruptly
and
thrust
the
man
away
from
him
a
different
expression
had
crept
into
his
face
an
expression
in
which
there
was
something
furtive
he
spun
around
upon
his
heel
and
stepped
to
the
tent
where
moreen
was
raising
the
flap
slightly
he
called
and
turned
away
ramsa
lal
had
gone
back
to
the
fireside
and
fayne
following
a
moment
of
hesitancy
strode
with
his
swaggering
military
gait
to
the
tent
erected
in
the
furthermost
corner
of
the
clearing
he
had
stooped
to
enter
when
he
hesitated
remaining
there
bent
forward
and
listening
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
distant
fire
ramsa
lal
though
few
would
have
suspected
the
fact
was
watching
evidently
enough
the
leader
of
the
little
company
was
obsessed
with
his
delusion
that
some
one
or
something
clambered
up
the
steep
path
beneath
suddenly
shrugging
his
shoulders
he
stooped
yet
lower
and
dived
into
the
tent
one
of
the
natives
threw
fresh
fuel
upon
the
fire
and
a
stream
of
sparks
sped
up
through
the
clear
air
in
a
widening
trail
ever
growing
fainter
there
was
a
crackling
a
murmur
of
voices
and
then
a
new
silence
this
in
turn
was
broken
by
the
distant
howling
of
dogs
and
in
the
near
stillness
one
might
have
heard
the
faint
shrieking
of
the
bats
who
now
were
embarked
upon
their
nocturnal
voyagings
a
shrill
wild
scream
burst
suddenly
from
the
heart
of
the
trees
in
the
east
rose
eerily
upon
the
night
and
died
away
but
the
group
about
the
fire
moved
not
at
all
for
this
dreadful
screaming
but
marked
an
animal
tragedy
of
the
burma
forests
so
furred
things
howled
and
screamed
and
moaned
in
the
woodlands
feathered
things
piped
and
hooted
around
and
above
and
the
bats
uncanny
creatures
of
the
darkness
who
seem
to
have
kinship
neither
with
fur
nor
feather
chirped
faintly
overhead
once
there
was
a
distant
hollow
booming
like
the
sound
of
artillery
which
echoed
down
the
mountain
gorges
and
seemed
to
roll
away
over
the
lowland
swamps
and
die
inaudible
by
the
remote
yet
no
one
stirred
for
this
mysterious
gunnery
is
a
phenomenon
met
with
in
that
district
inexplicable
weird
but
no
novelty
to
one
who
has
camped
in
the
shan
hills
a
second
time
later
in
the
night
the
phantom
guns
boomed
and
again
their
booming
died
away
in
the
far
valleys
the
fire
was
getting
low
now
iii
moreen
lay
sleepless
staring
up
at
the
roof
of
the
tent
she
had
eaten
could
eat
nothing
but
she
was
consumed
by
a
parching
thirst
the
sounds
of
the
night
had
no
terrors
for
her
indeed
she
scarcely
noticed
them
for
she
had
other
and
more
dreadful
things
to
think
of
ramsa
lal
had
been
her
father
servant
him
she
could
trust
but
the
others
the
others
were
major
fayne
they
were
no
more
than
spies
upon
her
guards
what
did
it
mean
this
sudden
dash
from
the
bungalow
into
the
hills
it
amused
her
husband
to
pretend
that
it
was
a
but
the
equipment
was
not
of
the
sort
one
takes
upon
such
occasions
and
one
is
not
usually
dragged
from
bed
at
midnight
to
embark
upon
such
a
journey
it
was
additionally
improbable
in
view
of
the
fact
that
up
to
the
moment
of
departure
major
fayne
had
not
spoken
to
her
except
in
public
for
six
months
the
dreadful
forced
marches
were
breaking
her
down
and
she
knew
that
her
husband
was
drinking
heavily
what
in
god
name
would
be
the
end
of
it
weakly
she
raised
herself
into
a
sitting
position
groping
for
and
lighting
a
candle
from
the
bosom
of
her
dress
she
took
out
a
letter
the
last
she
had
received
from
home
before
this
mad
flight
there
was
something
in
it
which
had
frightened
her
at
the
time
but
which
viewed
in
the
light
of
recent
events
was
unspeakably
horrifying
during
the
long
estrangement
between
her
husband
and
herself
she
had
learnt
and
had
paid
for
her
knowledge
with
bitter
tears
that
there
was
a
side
to
the
character
of
major
fayne
which
he
had
carefully
concealed
from
her
before
marriage
the
dark
saturnine
part
of
her
character
had
dawned
upon
her
suddenly
that
had
been
the
beginning
of
her
disillusionment
the
disillusionment
which
has
come
to
more
than
one
english
girl
during
the
first
twelve
months
of
married
life
in
an
indian
bungalow
then
perforce
the
gap
had
widened
and
six
months
later
had
become
a
chasm
quite
impassable
except
in
the
interests
of
social
propriety
society
is
notable
for
divorces
and
poor
moreen
very
early
in
her
married
life
fully
understood
the
reason
she
held
the
letter
to
the
dim
light
and
read
it
again
attentively
allowing
a
certain
discount
for
her
mother
changeless
animosity
towards
major
fayne
it
yet
remained
a
startling
letter
much
of
it
consisted
in
feckless
condolences
characteristic
but
foolish
the
passage
however
which
she
read
and
by
the
dim
flickering
light
was
as
follows
harringay
in
his
last
letter
begged
of
me
to
come
out
by
the
next
boat
to
rangoon
her
mother
wrote
he
has
quite
opened
my
eyes
to
the
truth
moreen
not
in
such
a
way
as
to
shock
me
all
at
once
but
gradually
i
always
distrusted
ralph
fayne
and
never
disguised
the
fact
from
you
i
knew
that
his
previous
life
had
been
far
from
irreproachable
but
his
treatment
of
you
surpasses
even
expectations
i
know
my
poor
darling
and
i
know
something
which
you
do
not
know
his
father
did
not
die
in
colombo
at
all
he
died
in
a
madhouse
and
there
are
two
other
known
dipsomaniacs
in
ralph
family
a
hand
reached
over
moreen
shoulder
and
tore
the
letter
from
her
she
turned
with
a
cry
and
looked
up
into
her
husband
quivering
face
for
a
moment
he
stood
over
her
his
left
fist
clenching
and
unclenching
and
his
pale
blue
eyes
glassy
with
anger
then
chokingly
he
spoke
so
you
carry
one
of
his
letters
about
with
you
the
veins
were
throbbing
visibly
upon
his
temples
moreen
clutched
at
the
blanket
but
did
not
speak
dared
not
move
for
if
ever
she
had
looked
into
the
face
of
a
madman
it
was
at
this
moment
when
she
looked
into
the
face
of
ralph
fayne
he
suddenly
grabbed
the
candle
and
holding
it
close
to
the
letter
began
to
read
his
hands
were
perfectly
steady
showing
the
tremendous
nerve
tension
under
which
he
laboured
then
his
expression
changed
but
nothing
of
the
maniac
glare
left
his
eyes
from
your
mother
he
said
hoarsely
and
full
of
two
things
your
wrongs
wrongs
and
jack
harringay
jack
harringay
always
jack
harringay
damn
him
he
put
down
the
candle
and
began
to
tear
the
letter
into
tiny
fragments
pouring
forth
the
while
a
stream
of
coarse
blasphemous
language
moreen
who
felt
that
consciousness
was
slipping
from
her
crouched
there
with
a
face
deathly
pale
fayne
began
to
laugh
softly
as
he
threw
the
letter
from
him
piece
by
piece
damn
him
he
said
again
he
turned
the
blazing
eyes
towards
his
wife
you
lying
hypocrite
why
do
you
admit
that
he
is
he
stopped
the
sinister
laughter
died
upon
his
lips
and
he
stood
there
shaking
all
over
and
with
a
sort
of
stark
horror
in
his
eyes
dreadful
to
see
why
do
you
he
muttered
and
looked
at
her
almost
pathetically
why
of
course
you
ca
no
one
can
he
reeled
and
clutched
at
the
then
stumblingly
made
his
way
out
no
one
can
came
back
in
a
shaky
whisper
no
one
can
moreen
heard
him
staggering
away
until
the
sound
of
his
uncertain
footsteps
grew
inaudible
a
distant
howling
rose
upon
the
night
and
nearer
to
the
clearing
sounded
a
sort
of
tapping
not
unlike
that
of
a
woodpecker
some
winged
creature
was
fluttering
over
the
tent
iv
dawn
saw
the
dreadful
march
resumed
major
fayne
now
exhibited
unmistakable
traces
of
his
course
of
heavy
drinking
he
brought
up
the
rear
as
hitherto
and
often
tarried
far
behind
where
some
peculiar
formation
of
the
path
enabled
him
to
study
the
country
already
traversed
he
had
altered
the
route
of
the
march
and
now
they
were
leaving
the
shan
hills
upon
the
and
dipping
down
to
a
valley
through
which
ran
a
tributary
of
the
selween
river
since
the
dry
season
was
commenced
the
entire
country
beneath
them
showed
through
a
haze
of
heat
and
dust
they
had
partaken
of
a
crude
and
hasty
breakfast
as
strangers
having
nothing
in
common
who
by
chance
share
a
table
moreen
no
longer
doubted
that
her
husband
was
mad
for
he
muttered
to
himself
and
was
ever
glancing
over
his
shoulder
this
and
his
constant
watching
of
the
path
behind
spoke
of
some
secret
terror
from
which
he
fled
towards
noon
they
skirted
a
village
whose
inhabitants
poured
forth
to
watch
the
passing
of
this
unfamiliar
company
a
faint
hope
that
some
european
might
be
there
died
in
moreen
breast
her
position
was
a
dreadful
one
led
by
a
madman
of
this
she
was
persuaded
and
surrounded
by
natives
who
if
not
actively
hostile
were
certainly
unfriendly
with
but
one
man
to
whom
she
could
look
for
the
slightest
aid
she
was
proceeding
further
and
further
from
civilisation
into
unknown
wildernesses
what
her
husband
purpose
might
be
she
could
not
conceive
she
was
unable
to
think
calmly
unable
to
formulate
any
plan
in
the
dull
misery
of
a
sick
dream
she
rode
forward
speculating
upon
the
awakening
the
midday
heat
in
the
valley
was
so
great
that
a
halt
became
imperative
they
camped
at
the
edge
of
a
dense
jungle
where
banks
of
rotten
vegetation
upon
the
top
lay
heaped
about
the
bamboo
stems
none
but
a
madman
would
have
chosen
to
tarry
in
such
a
spot
and
major
fayne
servants
went
about
their
work
with
many
a
furtive
glance
at
their
master
ramsa
lal
velvety
eyes
showed
a
great
compassion
but
moreen
offered
no
protest
she
was
in
an
unreal
frame
of
mind
and
her
will
was
merely
capable
of
a
mute
indifference
any
attempt
to
assert
herself
would
have
meant
a
sudden
breakdown
something
in
her
brain
was
strained
to
utmost
tension
any
further
effort
must
have
snapped
it
in
the
hour
of
the
greatest
heat
major
fayne
went
out
alone
offering
no
explanation
of
his
intentions
and
leaving
no
word
as
to
the
time
of
his
return
moreen
only
learnt
of
his
departure
from
ramsa
lal
she
received
the
news
with
indifference
and
asked
no
questions
inert
she
lay
in
the
little
tent
looking
out
at
the
wall
of
jungle
where
it
uprose
but
twenty
yards
away
so
the
day
wore
on
mechanically
she
partook
of
food
when
ramsa
lal
placed
it
before
her
but
although
the
man
attitude
palpably
was
one
of
uneasiness
she
did
not
question
him
and
he
departed
in
silence
it
was
an
incredible
situation
throughout
the
afternoon
nothing
occurred
to
break
this
dread
monotony
save
that
once
there
arose
a
buzz
of
conversation
and
she
became
dimly
aware
that
some
one
from
the
native
village
which
they
had
passed
in
the
morning
had
come
into
the
camp
after
a
time
the
sounds
had
died
away
again
and
ramsa
lal
had
stepped
into
view
looking
towards
her
interrogatively
but
although
she
recognized
his
wish
to
speak
to
her
the
inertia
which
now
claimed
her
mind
and
body
prevailed
and
she
offered
him
no
encouragement
to
intrude
upon
her
misery
thus
the
weary
hours
passed
until
even
to
the
dulled
perceptions
of
moreen
the
sounds
of
unrest
and
uneasiness
pervading
the
camp
began
to
penetrate
yet
major
fayne
did
not
return
the
insect
and
reptile
life
of
a
burmese
jungle
moved
around
her
but
she
was
curiously
indifferent
to
everything
without
alarm
she
brushed
a
venomous
spider
fully
one
inch
in
girth
from
the
and
dully
watched
it
darting
away
into
the
jungle
undergrowth
darkness
swept
down
and
tropical
night
things
raised
their
mingled
voices
then
came
ramsa
lal
forgive
me
mem
sahib
he
said
but
i
must
speak
to
you
she
half
reclined
looking
at
him
as
he
stood
a
dimly
seen
figure
before
her
the
men
from
the
village
continued
he
come
to
say
that
we
may
not
camp
it
is
holy
ground
from
this
place
away
he
waved
his
arm
vaguely
to
the
end
of
the
jungle
where
the
river
is
i
can
do
nothing
ramsa
lal
i
fear
for
him
major
fayne
he
goes
into
the
jungle
to
look
for
something
what
does
he
go
to
look
for
why
does
he
not
return
moreen
made
no
reply
all
of
them
there
he
indicated
the
direction
of
the
native
servants
know
this
place
they
are
already
afraid
and
with
those
from
the
village
coming
to
warn
us
they
get
more
afraid
still
this
is
a
haunted
place
mem
sahib
moreen
sat
up
shaking
off
something
of
the
lassitude
which
possessed
her
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
in
that
jungle
replied
ramsa
lal
there
is
buried
a
temple
a
very
old
temple
and
in
the
temple
there
is
buried
one
who
was
a
holy
man
his
spirit
watches
over
this
place
and
none
may
rest
here
because
of
him
but
the
men
of
the
village
came
here
said
moreen
before
sunset
mem
sahib
no
man
would
come
here
after
dark
look
you
will
see
they
are
frightened
languidly
but
with
some
awakening
to
the
necessities
of
the
situation
moreen
stepped
out
of
the
tent
and
looked
across
to
where
about
a
great
fire
the
retinue
huddled
in
a
circle
ramsa
lal
stood
beside
her
with
something
contemptuous
in
the
bearing
of
his
tall
figure
a
spell
lies
upon
all
this
valley
mem
sahib
he
said
therefore
it
is
called
the
valley
of
the
just
why
because
only
the
just
can
stay
within
its
bounds
through
the
night
moreen
stared
affrightedly
do
you
mean
that
they
die
in
the
night
ramsa
lal
in
the
night
mem
sahib
before
the
dawn
by
what
means
ramsa
lal
spread
his
palms
eloquently
who
knows
he
replied
it
is
a
haunted
place
and
are
you
afraid
i
am
not
afraid
for
i
have
passed
a
night
in
the
valley
of
the
just
many
years
ago
and
i
live
you
were
alone
with
two
others
mem
sahib
and
the
others
one
was
bitten
by
a
snake
an
hour
before
dawn
and
the
other
who
was
an
upright
man
lives
moreen
shuddered
do
you
know
she
still
hesitated
to
broach
this
subject
with
the
man
do
you
know
where
major
fayne
has
gone
it
is
said
mem
sahib
that
a
stream
runs
through
the
jungle
close
beside
the
old
temple
a
stream
which
bubbles
up
from
a
cavern
and
which
is
supposed
to
come
underground
from
the
ruby
mine
plateau
he
goes
early
in
the
morning
to
look
for
rubies
so
i
think
moreen
tapped
the
ground
with
her
foot
do
you
think
again
she
hesitated
that
major
fayne
is
afraid
of
something
of
something
where
we
have
come
from
ramsa
lal
bowed
low
i
can
not
tell
he
replied
but
we
shall
know
ere
sunrise
for
a
moment
moreen
scarcely
grasped
the
significance
of
his
words
then
their
inner
meaning
became
apparent
to
her
make
me
some
coffee
ramsa
lal
she
said
i
am
cold
very
cold
she
the
tent
lighting
the
lamp
the
valley
of
the
just
what
irony
that
her
husband
should
have
selected
that
spot
to
camp
in
she
sat
deep
in
thought
when
presently
ramsa
lal
entered
with
coffee
he
had
just
set
down
the
tray
when
the
sound
of
a
distant
cry
brought
him
rigidly
upright
he
stood
listening
intently
the
sound
was
repeated
nearer
it
seemed
a
sort
of
hoarse
scream
terrible
to
hear
impossible
to
describe
moreen
rose
to
her
feet
and
followed
the
man
out
of
the
tent
some
one
some
one
who
kept
crying
out
was
plunging
heavily
through
the
jungle
towards
the
camp
the
men
about
the
fire
were
on
their
feet
now
obviously
they
would
have
fled
but
the
prospect
of
flight
into
the
haunted
darkness
was
one
more
terrible
than
that
of
remaining
where
they
were
it
ceased
that
strange
cry
but
whoever
was
approaching
could
be
heard
alternately
groaning
and
laughing
madly
then
out
from
the
thicket
on
the
west
into
the
red
light
of
the
fire
burst
a
fearful
figure
it
was
that
of
major
fayne
wild
eyed
and
with
face
which
seemed
to
be
of
a
dull
grey
he
staggered
and
almost
fell
but
kept
on
for
a
few
more
paces
and
then
collapsed
in
a
heap
almost
at
moreen
feet
amid
the
clatter
of
the
strange
loot
wherewith
he
was
laden
this
consisted
in
a
number
of
golden
vessels
heavily
encrusted
with
gems
a
huge
golden
salver
and
a
dozen
or
more
ropes
of
gigantic
rubies
amid
these
treasures
the
ransom
of
a
sultan
the
price
of
a
throne
he
lay
writhing
convulsively
ramsa
lal
was
the
first
to
recover
himself
he
leapt
forward
seized
the
prostrate
man
by
the
shoulders
and
dragged
him
into
the
tent
past
moreen
having
effected
this
he
raised
his
eyes
in
a
mute
question
she
nodded
and
whilst
ramsa
lal
seized
the
major
shoulders
moreen
grasped
his
ankles
and
together
they
lifted
him
up
on
to
the
bed
he
lay
there
rolling
from
side
to
side
his
eyes
were
wide
open
glassy
and
unseeing
a
slight
froth
was
upon
his
lips
his
fists
rose
and
fell
in
regular
mechanical
beats
corresponding
with
the
convulsive
movements
of
his
knees
moreen
dropped
down
beside
him
ramsa
lal
ramsa
lal
what
shall
i
do
what
has
happened
to
him
ramsa
lal
ripped
the
collar
from
major
fayne
neck
in
order
to
aid
his
respiration
then
quietly
signing
to
moreen
to
hold
the
lamp
he
began
to
search
the
entire
exposed
surface
of
the
major
skin
evidently
he
failed
to
find
that
for
which
he
was
looking
he
glanced
down
at
the
ankles
but
the
major
wore
thick
putties
and
ramsa
lal
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
way
it
is
like
the
bite
of
a
hamadryad
he
said
softly
but
there
is
no
mark
what
shall
i
do
moaned
moreen
what
shall
i
do
there
was
a
frightened
murmur
from
the
entrance
where
the
native
servants
stood
in
a
group
peering
in
moreen
stood
up
hot
water
ramsa
lal
she
said
we
must
give
him
brandy
but
it
is
useless
mem
sahib
he
has
not
been
bitten
there
is
no
mark
it
may
be
a
fever
from
the
jungle
moreen
beat
her
hands
together
helplessly
we
must
do
she
said
we
must
do
a
sudden
change
took
place
in
major
fayne
the
convulsive
movements
ceased
and
he
lay
quiet
and
breathing
quite
regularly
the
glassy
look
began
to
fade
from
his
eyes
and
with
every
appearance
of
being
in
full
possession
of
his
senses
he
stared
at
moreen
and
spoke
you
shall
repent
of
your
words
harringay
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
you
have
deliberately
accused
me
of
faking
the
cards
i
care
nothing
for
any
of
you
why
should
i
attempt
such
a
thing
i
could
buy
and
sell
you
all
moreen
dropped
slowly
back
upon
her
knees
again
white
to
the
lips
watching
her
husband
with
the
same
appearance
of
perfect
sanity
but
now
addressing
the
empty
air
he
continued
in
my
tent
my
wife
will
tell
you
it
is
true
my
wife
harringay
do
you
hear
i
have
jewelled
cups
and
strings
of
rubies
enough
to
buy
up
mandalay
i
blundered
on
to
them
in
that
old
ruined
temple
back
in
the
jungle
not
five
hundred
yards
from
your
bungalow
harringay
think
of
it
a
like
that
within
sight
of
your
verandah
there
are
snakes
there
snakes
you
understand
in
hundreds
but
it
is
worth
risking
for
a
big
fortune
like
mine
he
mixes
time
and
place
murmured
ramsa
lal
he
talks
to
the
commissioner
sahib
in
mandalay
of
what
is
here
in
the
valley
of
the
just
moreen
nodded
catching
her
breath
hysterically
you
see
continued
the
delirious
man
i
am
as
rich
as
midas
why
should
want
to
cheat
you
do
talk
to
me
of
what
you
would
do
for
my
wife
sake
keep
your
favours
curse
you
with
a
contemptuous
smile
major
fayne
threw
his
head
back
upon
the
pallet
then
came
another
change
the
look
of
stark
horror
which
moreen
had
seen
once
before
crept
into
the
grey
face
and
her
husband
raised
himself
in
bed
glaring
wildly
into
the
shadows
beyond
the
lamp
you
are
a
spirit
the
words
came
in
a
thrilling
eerie
whisper
oh
god
i
understand
yes
i
came
away
from
harringay
bungalow
my
wife
was
asleep
and
i
sat
drinking
until
i
had
emptied
the
whisky
decanter
he
bent
forward
as
if
listening
yes
i
went
back
i
went
back
to
reason
with
him
no
as
god
is
my
witness
i
did
not
plan
it
i
went
back
to
reason
with
him
again
the
uncanny
attitude
was
resumed
then
i
stepped
in
through
the
verandah
and
there
he
sat
with
photograph
in
his
hand
listen
to
me
there
was
an
agony
of
entreaty
in
his
voice
it
rose
to
a
thin
scream
my
wife
photograph
do
you
hear
me
do
you
understand
photograph
and
as
i
stood
behind
him
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
he
major
fayne
stopped
abruptly
as
if
checked
by
a
spoken
word
and
with
wildly
beating
heart
moreen
found
herself
listening
for
the
phantom
voice
she
could
hear
the
breathing
of
the
natives
clustered
behind
her
but
no
other
sound
save
a
distant
howling
in
the
jungle
was
audible
until
her
husband
began
again
i
struck
him
down
from
behind
yes
from
behind
his
blood
poured
over
the
picture
you
understand
i
was
mad
if
you
are
just
and
is
not
this
called
the
valley
of
the
just
you
can
not
condemn
me
why
did
i
fly
i
was
not
in
my
right
mind
i
had
been
drinking
as
i
told
you
i
was
mad
if
i
was
not
mad
i
should
never
have
fled
never
have
drawn
suspicion
on
myself
he
fell
back
as
if
exhausted
then
once
more
struggled
upright
and
began
to
peer
about
him
when
he
spoke
again
his
voice
though
weak
was
more
like
his
own
moreen
he
said
where
the
devil
are
you
why
ca
you
give
me
a
drink
suddenly
he
seemed
to
perceive
her
and
he
drew
his
brows
together
in
the
old
ugly
frown
curse
you
he
said
i
have
found
you
out
i
am
a
rich
man
now
and
when
i
have
gone
to
england
see
what
jack
harringay
will
do
for
you
i
will
paint
london
red
i
have
looted
the
old
temple
and
they
are
after
me
they
the
words
merged
into
a
frightful
scream
major
fayne
threw
up
his
hands
and
fell
back
insensible
upon
the
bed
mem
sahib
mem
sahib
you
must
be
brave
it
was
ramsa
lal
who
spoke
he
supported
moreen
with
his
arm
there
is
a
spell
upon
this
place
no
medicine
nothing
can
save
him
there
is
only
one
thing
moreen
controlled
herself
by
one
of
those
giant
efforts
of
which
she
was
capable
tell
me
she
whispered
what
must
we
do
ramsa
lal
removed
his
arm
saw
that
she
could
stand
unsupported
and
bent
forward
over
the
unconscious
man
following
a
rapid
examination
he
signed
to
her
to
leave
the
tent
they
came
out
into
the
white
blaze
of
the
moonlight
and
there
at
their
feet
lay
the
glittering
loot
of
the
haunted
temple
a
dazzlement
of
rainbow
sparks
only
for
such
a
thing
as
this
said
ramsa
lal
dare
i
go
but
not
one
of
us
will
see
another
dawn
if
we
do
not
go
he
pointed
to
the
heap
of
treasure
mem
sahib
must
come
also
but
my
husband
he
must
remain
he
said
it
is
of
his
own
choosing
v
the
temple
stood
in
a
kind
of
clearing
grotesquely
horrible
figures
guarded
the
entrance
moreen
drew
a
deep
breath
of
relief
on
emerging
from
the
jungle
path
by
which
amid
the
rustle
of
retreating
snakes
they
had
come
but
shrank
back
affrighted
from
the
blackness
of
the
ruined
doorway
ramsa
lal
stood
the
lantern
upon
the
stump
of
a
broken
pillar
where
its
faint
yellow
light
was
paled
by
the
it
is
who
must
restore
he
said
one
by
one
he
handed
her
the
vessels
and
hung
the
ropes
of
rubies
upon
her
arm
she
nodded
and
as
ramsa
lal
took
up
the
lantern
and
began
to
descend
the
steps
within
followed
him
no
foot
save
his
came
back
to
her
has
trod
these
sacred
steps
for
ages
for
the
secret
of
the
jungle
path
is
known
only
to
the
few
how
do
you
know
the
way
ramsa
lal
did
not
reply
they
traversed
a
short
tunnel
a
heavy
door
was
thrust
open
and
moreen
found
herself
standing
in
a
small
pillared
hall
through
a
window
high
in
one
wall
overgrown
with
tangled
vegetation
crept
a
broken
moonbeam
directly
before
her
was
the
carven
figure
of
a
grotesque
deity
a
long
heavily
clamped
chest
stood
before
it
like
an
altar
step
she
staggered
forward
deposited
her
priceless
burden
upon
the
floor
and
mechanically
began
to
raise
the
lid
of
the
chest
not
that
one
mem
sahib
the
voice
of
ramsa
lal
rose
shrilly
not
that
one
but
he
spoke
too
late
moreen
realised
that
there
were
three
divisions
in
the
chest
each
having
a
separate
lid
as
she
raised
the
one
in
the
centre
a
breath
of
fetid
air
greeted
her
nostrils
and
she
had
a
vague
impression
that
this
was
no
chest
but
the
entrance
to
a
deep
pit
then
all
these
thoughts
were
swept
away
by
the
crowning
horror
which
rose
out
of
the
subterranean
darkness
a
great
winged
creature
clammily
white
rose
towards
her
passed
beneath
her
upraised
hands
and
sailed
into
the
darkness
on
the
right
she
heard
it
flapping
its
great
bat
wings
against
the
wall
heard
them
beating
upon
a
pillar
then
saw
it
coming
back
towards
her
into
the
moonlight
and
knew
no
more
vi
mem
sahib
moreen
opened
her
eyes
she
lay
propped
against
a
saddle
at
the
camp
beside
the
jungle
she
shuddered
icily
ramsa
lal
how
i
carried
the
mem
sahib
the
treasures
of
the
temple
i
restored
to
their
and
the
the
other
the
door
that
the
mem
sahib
opened
she
opened
by
the
decree
of
fate
it
was
not
for
ramsa
lal
to
close
it
that
is
a
passage
yes
to
the
tomb
of
the
great
one
who
is
buried
in
the
temple
oh
heavens
that
white
thing
she
raised
her
hands
to
her
face
but
the
camp
the
camp
is
deserted
they
all
fled
from
moreen
sat
up
rigidly
from
what
from
something
that
came
for
what
we
forgot
my
husband
there
was
a
ring
upon
his
finger
i
saw
it
and
knew
where
it
came
from
but
forgot
to
remove
it
moreen
stood
up
and
turned
towards
the
nearer
tent
ramsa
lal
gently
detained
her
not
that
way
mem
sahib
but
i
must
see
him
i
must
i
tell
him
that
he
wrongs
me
cruelly
wickedly
you
heard
his
words
oh
god
can
he
have
it
would
be
useless
to
tell
him
mem
sahib
he
could
not
hear
you
but
that
what
you
would
tell
him
is
true
i
know
well
for
see
it
is
the
dawn
ramsa
lal
the
unjust
can
not
stay
in
this
valley
through
a
night
and
live
to
see
the
dawn
mem
sahib
vii
at
about
that
same
hour
jack
harringay
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
wonderingly
at
a
nurse
who
sat
watching
him
do
speak
harringay
she
said
soothingly
you
have
been
very
ill
but
you
are
on
the
high
road
to
recovery
now
nurse
please
do
speak
i
know
what
you
would
ask
there
has
been
no
scandal
the
attack
upon
you
was
ascribed
to
robbers
you
have
been
delirious
harringay
and
have
told
me
many
things
i
am
old
enough
or
nearly
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
so
you
will
not
mind
my
telling
you
that
a
love
like
yours
deserves
reward
god
has
spared
your
life
be
sure
it
was
with
a
purpose
the
blue
monkey
i
a
tropically
hot
day
had
been
followed
by
a
stuffy
and
oppressive
evening
in
the
tiny
of
our
tiny
cottage
my
friend
who
for
the
purposes
of
this
story
i
shall
call
east
by
the
light
of
a
vapour
lamp
was
busily
arranging
a
number
of
botanical
specimens
collected
that
morning
his
briar
fumed
furiously
between
his
teeth
and
his
grim
tanned
face
lowered
over
his
work
he
brought
to
bear
upon
this
task
all
the
intense
nervous
energy
which
was
his
i
sat
by
the
open
window
alternately
watching
my
tireless
companion
and
the
wonderful
and
almost
eerie
effects
of
the
moonlight
on
the
heather
then
we
came
here
for
quiet
and
rest
east
i
said
smiling
well
snapped
my
friend
is
it
quiet
enough
for
you
undeniably
but
i
do
remember
to
have
seen
you
rest
from
the
moment
that
we
left
london
i
exclude
your
brief
hours
of
slumber
during
which
by
the
way
you
toss
about
and
mutter
in
a
manner
far
from
reposeful
no
wonder
my
nerves
are
anything
but
settled
yet
i
grant
you
indeed
we
had
passed
through
a
long
and
trying
ordeal
the
particulars
whereof
have
no
bearing
upon
the
present
matter
and
in
renting
this
tiny
and
remote
cottage
we
had
sought
complete
seclusion
and
forgetfulness
of
those
evil
activities
of
man
which
had
so
long
engaged
our
attention
how
ill
we
had
chosen
will
now
appear
i
had
turned
again
to
the
open
window
when
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
a
sound
that
seemed
to
come
from
somewhere
away
behind
the
cottage
cigarette
in
hand
i
leaned
upon
the
sill
listening
then
turned
and
glanced
toward
the
littered
table
east
his
eyes
steely
bright
in
the
lamplight
was
watching
me
you
heard
it
i
said
clearly
a
woman
shriek
listen
tense
expectant
we
sat
listening
for
some
time
until
i
began
to
suspect
that
we
had
been
deceived
by
the
note
of
some
unfamiliar
denizen
of
the
moors
then
faintly
chokingly
the
sound
was
repeated
seemingly
from
much
nearer
come
on
snapped
east
hatless
we
both
hurried
around
to
the
rear
of
the
cottage
as
we
came
out
upon
the
slope
a
figure
appeared
on
the
brow
of
a
mound
some
two
hundred
yards
away
and
stood
for
a
moment
silhouetted
against
the
moonlit
sky
it
was
that
of
a
woman
she
raised
her
arms
at
sight
of
us
and
staggered
forward
just
in
the
nick
of
time
we
reached
her
for
her
strength
was
almost
spent
east
caught
her
in
his
arms
good
god
he
said
it
is
miss
baird
what
could
it
mean
the
girl
who
was
near
to
swooning
and
inarticulate
with
fatigue
and
emotion
was
the
daughter
of
sir
jeffrey
baird
our
neighbour
whose
house
the
warrens
was
visible
from
where
we
stood
east
half
led
half
carried
her
down
the
slope
to
the
cottage
and
there
i
gave
her
professional
attention
whilst
with
eyes
and
parted
lips
she
fought
for
mastery
of
herself
she
was
a
rather
pretty
girl
but
highly
emotional
and
her
pathetically
weak
mouth
was
doubtless
a
maternal
heritage
for
her
father
sir
jeffrey
had
the
mouth
and
jaw
of
the
old
fighter
that
he
was
at
last
she
achieved
speech
my
father
she
whispered
brokenly
oh
my
poor
father
what
i
began
at
black
gap
black
gap
i
said
for
the
place
was
close
upon
half
a
mile
away
have
you
come
so
far
he
is
lying
there
my
poor
father
dead
what
cried
east
springing
up
sir
jeffrey
dead
not
drowned
no
no
he
is
lying
on
the
path
this
side
of
the
gap
i
almost
stumbled
over
him
he
has
been
murdered
oh
god
help
me
east
and
i
stared
at
one
another
speechless
with
the
sudden
horror
of
it
sir
jeffrey
murdered
suddenly
the
distracted
girl
turned
to
my
friend
clutching
frenziedly
at
his
arm
oh
mr
east
she
cried
what
had
my
poor
father
done
to
merit
such
an
end
what
monster
has
struck
him
down
you
will
find
him
will
you
not
i
thank
god
that
you
are
here
for
although
i
know
you
as
east
my
father
confided
the
truth
to
me
and
i
am
aware
that
you
are
really
a
secret
service
agent
and
i
even
know
some
of
the
wonderful
things
you
have
done
in
the
past
very
indiscreet
muttered
east
and
his
jaws
snapped
together
viciously
but
my
dear
miss
baird
he
added
immediately
in
the
kindly
way
that
was
his
own
rely
upon
me
myself
and
my
the
doctor
here
had
sought
to
escape
from
the
darker
things
of
life
but
it
was
willed
otherwise
i
esteemed
sir
jeffrey
very
highly
his
voice
shook
very
highly
indeed
i
too
thank
god
that
i
am
here
ii
five
minutes
later
east
and
i
set
out
across
the
moor
leaving
miss
baird
at
the
cottage
by
reason
of
the
lonely
situation
and
the
fact
that
the
nearest
house
the
warrens
was
fully
a
mile
and
a
half
away
no
other
arrangement
was
possible
since
delay
could
not
be
entertained
east
had
managed
to
glean
some
few
important
facts
sir
jeffrey
whose
museum
at
the
warrens
was
justly
celebrated
had
been
to
london
that
day
to
attend
an
auction
at
sotheby
his
greek
secretary
damopolon
and
his
daughter
had
accompanied
him
returning
by
train
to
stanby
the
nearest
station
miss
baird
had
called
upon
friends
in
the
village
damopolon
had
remained
in
london
on
business
and
sir
jeffrey
had
set
out
in
the
dusk
to
walk
the
two
miles
to
the
warrens
for
the
car
was
undergoing
repairs
pursuing
the
same
path
later
in
the
evening
the
girl
had
come
upon
the
body
of
her
father
in
the
dramatically
dreadful
manner
already
related
he
had
no
enemies
she
declared
or
none
known
to
her
she
did
not
believe
that
her
father
was
carrying
a
large
sum
of
money
nor
although
she
had
scarcely
trusted
herself
to
look
at
him
did
she
believe
that
robbery
had
been
the
motive
of
the
crime
sir
jeffrey
had
been
carrying
a
large
parcel
containing
one
of
his
purchases
and
i
remembered
as
we
silently
pursued
our
way
to
the
scene
of
the
murder
how
east
keen
eyes
had
seemed
to
dance
with
excitement
when
miss
baird
in
reply
to
a
question
had
told
us
what
this
parcel
contained
it
was
a
large
figure
in
blue
porcelain
of
a
sacred
ape
and
was
of
burmese
or
chinese
origin
she
was
uncertain
which
her
father
had
apparently
attached
great
importance
to
this
strange
purchase
and
had
elected
to
bear
it
home
in
person
rather
than
to
trust
it
to
railway
transport
did
you
notice
if
this
parcel
was
there
east
had
inquired
eagerly
when
you
discovered
him
miss
baird
had
shaken
her
head
in
reply
and
now
we
were
come
to
black
gap
a
weird
feature
in
a
weird
landscape
this
was
a
great
hole
in
the
moor
having
high
clay
banks
upon
one
side
descending
sheer
to
the
tarn
and
upon
the
other
being
flanked
by
low
marshy
ground
about
a
small
coppice
the
road
from
stanby
to
the
warrens
passed
close
by
the
coppice
on
the
regarding
this
place
opinions
differed
by
some
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
natural
formation
but
it
was
locally
believed
to
mark
the
site
of
an
abandoned
mine
possibly
roman
its
depth
was
unknown
and
the
legend
of
the
coach
which
lay
at
the
bottom
and
which
could
be
seen
under
certain
favourable
conditions
has
found
a
place
in
all
the
to
that
picturesque
and
wild
district
whatever
its
origin
black
gap
was
a
weird
and
gloomy
spot
as
one
approached
and
saw
through
the
trees
the
gleam
of
the
moonlight
on
its
mystic
waters
and
here
passing
a
slight
southerly
bend
in
the
track
for
it
was
no
more
we
came
upon
sir
jeffrey
he
lay
huddled
in
a
grotesque
and
unnatural
attitude
his
right
hand
was
tightly
clenched
whilst
with
his
left
he
clutched
a
tuft
of
rank
grass
strangely
enough
his
soft
hat
was
still
upon
his
head
his
tweed
suit
soft
collar
and
tie
all
bore
evidence
of
the
fierce
struggle
which
the
old
baronet
had
put
up
for
his
life
a
quantity
of
torn
brown
paper
lay
scattered
near
the
body
i
dropped
on
my
knees
and
made
a
rapid
examination
east
directing
the
ray
of
a
upon
the
poor
victim
well
rapped
my
friend
he
was
struck
over
the
head
by
some
heavy
weapon
i
said
slowly
and
perhaps
partly
stunned
his
hat
protected
him
to
a
degree
and
he
tackled
his
assailant
death
was
actually
due
i
should
say
to
strangulation
his
throat
is
very
much
bruised
east
made
no
reply
glancing
up
from
my
gruesome
task
i
observed
that
he
was
looking
at
a
faint
track
which
commencing
amid
the
confused
marks
surrounding
the
body
led
in
the
direction
of
the
coppice
steely
eyes
were
widely
opened
in
heaven
name
what
have
we
here
he
said
a
kindred
amazement
to
that
which
held
east
claimed
me
as
i
studied
more
closely
the
mysterious
tracks
the
spot
where
sir
jeffrey
had
fallen
was
soft
ground
whereon
the
lightest
footstep
must
have
left
a
clear
impression
indeed
around
the
recumbent
figure
the
ground
showed
a
mass
of
indistinguishable
marks
but
proceeding
thence
as
i
have
said
in
the
direction
of
the
neighbouring
coppice
was
this
faint
trail
it
looks
i
said
in
a
voice
hushed
with
something
very
like
awe
it
looks
like
the
track
of
look
again
snapped
east
i
stooped
over
the
first
set
of
marks
clearly
indented
i
perceived
the
impressions
of
two
small
bare
feet
and
eighteen
or
twenty
inches
ahead
those
of
two
small
hands
i
experienced
a
sudden
chill
my
blood
seemed
momentarily
to
run
coldly
in
my
veins
and
i
longed
to
depart
from
the
shadow
of
the
trees
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
black
gap
and
from
the
neighbourhood
of
the
man
who
had
died
there
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
a
barefooted
infant
had
recently
crawled
from
the
side
of
the
dead
man
into
the
coppice
overhanging
the
tarn
looking
up
i
found
east
steely
eyes
set
upon
me
strangely
well
said
he
do
you
not
miss
something
that
you
anticipated
finding
i
hesitated
fearfully
then
sir
jeffrey
carries
no
cane
i
began
good
i
had
failed
to
note
that
good
but
what
else
closely
i
surveyed
the
body
noting
the
disarranged
garments
the
discoloured
face
what
of
this
torn
brown
paper
snapped
my
friend
good
heavens
i
cried
and
like
a
flash
my
glance
sought
again
those
mysterious
tracks
those
tracks
of
that
had
crawled
away
from
the
murdered
man
where
inquired
east
deliberately
is
the
burmese
porcelain
ape
of
which
we
have
heard
and
since
there
are
no
tracks
the
body
where
did
the
creature
come
from
that
made
those
retiring
from
it
and
what
manner
of
creature
was
it
iii
at
east
request
for
my
friend
was
a
man
of
very
great
influence
the
police
beyond
the
unavoidable
formalities
took
no
steps
to
apprehend
the
murderer
of
sir
jeffrey
east
had
a
long
interview
with
the
dead
man
daughter
and
shortly
afterwards
went
off
to
london
leaving
me
to
my
own
devices
the
subject
of
the
strange
death
of
the
baronet
naturally
engrossed
my
attention
to
the
exclusion
of
all
else
especially
my
mind
kept
reverting
to
the
tracks
which
we
had
discovered
leading
from
the
dead
man
body
into
the
coppice
i
scarcely
dared
to
follow
my
ideas
to
what
seemed
to
be
their
logical
conclusion
that
the
track
was
that
not
of
a
child
but
of
an
i
was
now
convinced
no
such
track
approached
where
the
victim
had
lain
no
track
of
any
kind
other
than
that
of
his
own
heavy
footprints
led
to
the
spot
but
the
track
of
an
ape
receded
from
it
and
the
baronet
had
been
carrying
an
ape
inanimate
certainly
according
to
all
known
natural
laws
which
was
missing
when
his
body
was
found
these
are
the
reflections
of
a
madman
i
said
aloud
am
i
seriously
considering
the
possibility
of
a
blue
porcelain
monkey
having
come
to
life
if
so
since
no
other
footprints
have
been
discovered
i
shall
be
compelled
logically
to
assume
that
the
blue
porcelain
monkey
strangled
sir
jeffrey
my
friend
east
attached
very
great
importance
to
the
missing
curio
this
he
had
not
disguised
from
me
but
beyond
spending
half
an
hour
or
so
among
the
trees
of
the
coppice
and
around
the
margin
of
the
black
gap
he
had
not
to
my
knowledge
essayed
any
quest
for
it
finding
my
thoughts
at
once
unpleasant
and
unprofitable
company
i
suddenly
determined
to
make
a
call
at
the
warrens
in
order
to
inquire
about
the
health
of
poor
miss
baird
and
incidentally
to
learn
if
there
were
any
new
development
off
i
set
and
failed
to
repress
a
shudder
despite
the
blazing
sunlight
as
i
passed
the
gap
and
the
spot
where
we
had
found
the
dead
man
a
tropical
shower
in
the
early
morning
had
quite
obliterated
the
mysterious
tracks
coming
to
the
warrens
i
was
shown
into
the
fine
old
library
that
air
of
hush
so
awesome
and
so
significant
prevailed
throughout
the
house
whose
master
lay
dead
above
and
when
presently
damopolon
entered
attired
in
black
he
seemed
to
complete
a
picture
already
sombre
as
east
and
i
had
several
times
remarked
he
was
a
singularly
handsome
man
and
moreover
a
very
charming
companion
widely
travelled
and
deeply
versed
in
those
subjects
to
which
the
late
baronet
had
devoted
so
many
years
of
his
life
i
had
always
liked
damopolon
though
as
a
rule
i
am
distrustful
of
his
race
and
now
seeing
at
a
glance
how
hard
the
death
of
sir
jeffrey
had
hit
him
i
offered
no
unnecessary
word
of
condolence
but
immediately
turned
the
conversation
upon
miss
baird
she
has
but
just
hurried
off
to
london
doctor
he
said
to
my
surprise
a
telegram
from
the
solicitors
rendered
her
immediate
departure
unavoidable
she
has
sustained
this
dreadful
blow
with
exemplary
fortitude
i
replied
are
you
sure
she
was
strong
enough
for
travel
i
myself
escorted
her
to
the
station
and
grierson
the
late
baronet
sister
has
accompanied
her
to
london
by
the
way
i
said
whilst
i
remember
was
sir
jeffrey
carrying
a
cane
at
the
time
of
his
death
he
had
with
him
a
heavy
ash
stick
as
usual
when
we
parted
at
sotheby
doctor
but
of
course
he
may
have
left
it
there
as
he
had
a
large
parcel
to
take
ah
that
parcel
you
can
no
doubt
enlighten
me
damopolon
what
roughly
were
the
dimensions
of
this
burmese
idol
the
monkey
i
do
think
it
was
actually
an
idol
doctor
it
was
rather
a
grotesque
ornament
oh
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
small
moorish
ape
hollow
and
weighing
perhaps
six
or
seven
pounds
was
it
upon
a
pedestal
no
it
was
completely
modelled
even
to
the
soles
of
the
feet
and
the
nails
extraordinary
i
muttered
uncanny
some
little
while
longer
i
remained
and
then
set
out
my
doubts
in
no
measure
cleared
up
for
the
cottage
to
my
surprise
for
i
had
no
idea
that
i
had
tarried
so
long
dusk
was
come
i
will
frankly
confess
it
i
experienced
a
thrill
of
supernatural
dread
at
the
thought
that
my
path
led
close
beside
black
gap
however
it
was
a
glorious
evening
and
i
should
have
plenty
of
light
for
my
return
journey
i
walked
briskly
across
the
moorpath
toward
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
crime
hoping
that
i
should
find
east
returned
when
i
gained
the
cottage
perhaps
in
a
wandering
life
i
have
known
more
thrilling
moments
than
some
men
but
never
while
memory
serves
shall
i
forget
that
when
coming
abreast
of
the
coppice
and
glancing
hurriedly
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
i
saw
a
crouching
figure
looking
out
at
me
speech
momentarily
failed
me
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
then
all
right
old
man
i
heard
shall
be
with
you
in
a
moment
it
was
east
fear
changed
to
the
wildest
astonishment
carrying
a
bundle
he
came
out
and
joined
me
on
the
path
did
i
frighten
you
is
it
necessary
to
ask
i
cried
but
whatever
were
you
doing
there
by
the
black
gap
fishing
look
what
i
have
caught
he
held
up
for
my
inspection
the
object
which
he
carried
by
means
of
two
loops
of
stout
cord
bound
about
it
it
was
a
large
china
figure
of
an
ape
the
blue
monkey
he
snapped
come
i
am
going
to
the
warrens
iv
again
i
sat
in
the
fine
old
library
of
the
warrens
at
the
further
end
of
the
long
table
facing
me
sat
east
damopolon
occupied
a
chair
on
the
right
and
midway
between
us
in
the
centre
of
the
table
presiding
over
that
strange
meeting
was
the
fateful
blue
monkey
you
see
damopolon
said
east
i
knew
that
sir
jeffrey
was
carrying
this
thing
he
indicated
the
image
at
the
time
of
his
death
and
since
it
had
disappeared
i
assumed
at
first
that
it
had
been
the
motive
of
the
crime
sir
jeffrey
had
money
and
other
valuables
upon
him
therefore
we
were
obviously
dealing
with
no
ordinary
thief
accordingly
i
made
inquiries
respecting
the
history
of
the
thing
and
found
that
it
possessed
but
little
market
value
and
next
to
no
historical
importance
it
was
of
comparatively
modern
chinese
workmanship
and
sir
jeffrey
had
bought
it
apparently
because
it
amused
him
though
why
he
should
have
taken
the
trouble
to
carry
it
home
heaven
only
knows
my
first
idea
that
the
curio
was
a
very
rare
and
costly
piece
was
thus
knocked
on
the
head
i
sought
another
motive
for
a
crime
so
horrible
and
by
a
stroke
of
intuition
i
found
one
you
may
not
have
had
an
opportunity
of
studying
the
mysterious
tracks
which
so
puzzled
us
damopolon
before
they
were
obliterated
but
my
friend
the
doctor
will
bear
me
out
they
commenced
then
close
beside
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
and
they
were
as
i
now
perceive
made
by
the
feet
of
this
blue
monstrosity
upon
the
table
here
impossible
murmured
the
secretary
incredulously
so
it
appeared
to
me
at
the
time
when
although
i
had
not
then
seen
the
image
of
the
monkey
i
perceived
by
the
absolutely
regular
character
of
the
impressions
that
they
were
made
not
by
a
living
creature
but
by
the
model
of
one
which
had
been
firmly
pressed
into
the
soft
ground
at
slightly
varying
intervals
since
no
footprints
other
than
those
of
sir
jeffrey
were
to
be
found
in
the
vicinity
i
was
unable
to
account
for
the
presence
of
the
person
who
had
made
these
impressions
i
devoted
myself
to
a
close
scrutiny
of
those
footprints
of
sir
jeffrey
which
led
up
to
the
scene
of
the
attack
it
became
apparent
immediately
that
some
one
had
him
some
one
who
crept
silently
along
behind
the
unsuspecting
victim
some
one
so
clever
that
he
placed
his
feet
in
the
marks
made
by
the
baronet
good
i
had
accounted
for
the
presence
of
the
murderer
he
struck
sir
jeffrey
with
some
heavy
implement
but
failed
to
stun
him
then
began
the
struggle
which
so
churned
up
the
ground
that
all
tracks
were
lost
the
murderer
prevailed
he
was
a
man
of
wonderful
nerve
never
once
did
he
place
his
foot
upon
virgin
ground
not
one
imprint
by
which
he
might
be
identified
did
he
leave
behind
him
then
how
inquired
damopolon
who
was
hanging
upon
every
word
did
he
leave
the
scene
if
listen
snapped
east
i
found
by
the
body
the
torn
paper
in
which
the
china
image
had
been
wrapped
but
no
string
i
went
all
the
way
to
london
to
learn
if
the
parcel
had
been
tied
with
string
and
if
sir
jeffrey
had
been
carrying
a
stick
but
surely
said
damopolon
i
could
have
saved
you
the
journey
since
i
was
with
the
late
baronet
immediately
before
he
set
out
for
home
quite
so
but
i
had
another
reason
for
my
visit
east
shot
a
sudden
glance
from
damopolon
to
myself
and
there
ensued
a
moment
of
electric
silence
beside
the
track
made
by
the
feet
of
the
image
he
resumed
slowly
i
found
a
series
of
holes
one
on
either
side
of
each
do
you
follow
me
mr
damopolon
perfectly
replied
the
greek
taking
up
and
lighting
a
cigarette
holes
you
say
they
were
the
clue
for
which
i
sought
i
saw
it
all
the
china
ape
had
been
used
as
a
the
cunning
criminal
had
thus
gained
the
firm
ground
in
the
coppice
without
leaving
a
footprint
behind
but
my
dear
east
i
interrupted
i
can
not
follow
you
he
stepped
from
beside
the
body
on
to
the
image
which
he
had
placed
at
a
convenient
distance
yes
then
by
means
of
loops
of
string
see
they
are
still
attached
he
lifted
it
forward
with
his
feet
but
supporting
his
weight
upon
two
sticks
sir
jeffrey
and
his
own
hence
the
holes
beside
the
track
he
had
actually
reached
firm
ground
when
his
own
stick
snapped
off
short
and
he
made
the
fatal
error
of
leaving
the
fragment
and
the
ferrule
imbedded
in
the
hole
here
is
the
fragment
on
the
table
east
laid
a
fragment
of
an
ebony
cane
broken
off
short
some
three
inches
above
the
nickel
ferrule
ebony
is
so
brittle
is
it
not
mr
damopolon
he
said
it
is
indeed
agreed
damopolon
standing
up
as
though
he
believed
east
to
have
finished
yet
this
stick
was
made
of
a
particularly
fine
piece
added
east
carter
he
cried
loudly
the
library
door
opened
and
detective
sergeant
carter
of
new
scotland
yard
entered
carrying
a
broken
ebony
stick
damopolon
dropped
his
cigarette
and
whilst
he
stooped
to
recover
it
carter
and
i
went
fishing
this
afternoon
said
east
in
the
black
gap
the
criminal
had
sought
to
hide
the
broken
cane
which
bears
his
monogram
and
also
the
image
he
had
tied
them
together
filled
the
image
with
clay
and
dropped
them
into
the
water
fortunately
they
stuck
upon
an
outstanding
mass
of
weeds
and
we
did
not
fish
in
vain
is
there
any
point
damopolon
which
i
have
not
made
clear
i
know
what
implement
you
used
to
strike
sir
jeffrey
nor
do
i
know
what
you
did
with
his
clutching
wildly
at
the
table
i
rose
to
my
feet
my
gaze
set
amazedly
upon
the
man
thus
accused
upon
the
man
i
had
called
my
friend
upon
the
man
who
owed
so
much
to
the
dead
baronet
and
he
he
tossed
his
cigarette
into
the
hearth
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
but
now
i
saw
that
he
was
deathly
pale
he
began
speaking
in
a
hoarse
mechanical
voice
i
struck
him
with
a
broken
elm
branch
he
said
his
hat
saved
him
i
completed
the
matter
with
my
bare
hands
i
was
desperate
you
need
not
tell
me
that
olive
miss
baird
has
confessed
to
our
secret
marriage
nor
shall
i
weary
you
with
the
many
reasons
i
had
to
hate
her
father
and
the
pressing
need
i
had
for
the
fortune
which
she
inherits
at
his
death
it
is
finished
i
have
lost
and
carter
cried
east
quick
quick
but
though
the
detective
who
had
been
edging
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
speaker
now
sprang
upon
him
with
the
leap
of
a
panther
he
was
too
late
the
sound
of
a
muffled
shot
echoed
through
the
warrens
and
the
greek
fell
with
an
appalling
crash
fully
over
the
library
table
so
that
the
blue
monkey
slid
across
its
polished
surface
and
was
shattered
to
bits
upon
the
oaken
floor
the
riddle
of
ragstaff
i
well
harry
my
boy
and
what
the
latest
news
from
venice
harry
lorian
stretched
his
long
legs
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
i
had
a
letter
from
the
governor
this
morning
colonel
he
appears
to
be
filling
his
portfolio
with
studies
of
windows
and
doorways
and
and
the
other
domestic
necessities
dear
to
his
architectural
soul
colonel
reynor
laughed
in
his
short
gruff
way
as
my
friend
lorian
gazing
sleepily
about
the
quaint
old
hall
in
which
we
sat
but
always
bringing
his
gaze
to
one
point
a
certain
door
blew
rings
of
smoke
straightly
upward
i
suppose
said
our
host
the
colonel
most
of
the
material
will
be
used
for
the
forthcoming
book
i
suppose
so
drawled
lorian
glancing
for
the
twentieth
time
at
the
yet
vacant
doorway
by
the
the
idea
of
architects
and
artists
and
other
constitutionally
languid
people
having
to
write
books
fills
my
soul
with
black
horror
he
had
a
glorious
time
with
our
old
panelling
harry
laughed
the
colonel
waving
his
cigar
vaguely
toward
the
panelled
walls
and
nooks
which
gradually
were
receding
into
the
twilight
yes
said
my
friend
he
was
here
quite
an
unconscionable
time
even
for
an
old
school
chum
of
the
proprietor
i
hope
you
counted
the
spoons
when
he
left
lorian
disrespectful
references
to
sir
julius
his
father
were
characteristic
for
he
reverences
that
famous
artist
with
the
double
love
of
a
son
and
a
pupil
of
course
we
did
chuckled
reynor
nothing
missing
my
boy
that
funny
drawled
lorian
because
if
he
did
steal
it
from
here
i
ca
imagine
from
where
he
stole
it
stole
what
harry
whatever
some
chap
broke
into
his
studio
for
last
night
eh
cried
the
colonel
sitting
suddenly
very
upright
into
your
father
studio
burglars
suppose
so
was
the
reply
they
took
nothing
that
i
was
aware
to
be
in
his
possession
though
the
place
was
ransacked
i
naturally
concluded
that
they
had
taken
something
that
i
was
to
be
in
his
ah
sybil
reynor
entered
by
the
door
which
for
the
past
twenty
minutes
had
been
the
focus
of
lorian
gaze
the
gathering
dusk
precluded
the
possibility
of
my
seeing
with
certainty
but
i
think
her
face
flushed
as
her
dark
eyes
rested
upon
my
friend
her
beauty
is
not
of
the
kind
which
needs
deceptive
to
perfect
it
but
there
in
the
dimness
as
she
came
towards
us
she
looked
very
lovely
and
divinely
graceful
i
did
not
envy
lorian
his
good
fortune
but
i
suppressed
a
sigh
when
i
saw
how
my
existence
had
escaped
the
girl
notice
and
how
the
world
in
her
eyes
contained
only
a
henry
lorian
her
mother
entered
shortly
afterwards
and
a
general
conversation
arose
which
continued
until
the
arrival
of
ralph
edie
and
his
sister
they
were
accompanied
by
felix
hulme
and
their
advent
completed
the
small
party
expected
at
ragstaff
park
you
late
arrivals
said
lorian
have
only
just
time
to
dress
unless
you
want
to
miss
everything
but
the
nuts
oh
harry
said
reynor
you
are
as
bad
as
your
father
worse
said
lorian
promptly
i
am
altogether
more
rude
and
have
a
bigger
appetite
with
such
seeming
trivialities
then
opened
the
drama
of
ragstaff
the
drama
in
which
fate
had
cast
four
of
us
for
leading
rôles
ii
following
dinner
the
men
or
as
my
friend
has
it
the
gunners
drifted
into
the
hall
the
hall
at
ragstaff
park
is
fitted
as
a
smoking
lounge
it
dates
back
to
tudor
days
and
affords
some
magnificent
examples
of
mediæval
panelling
at
every
point
the
eye
meets
the
device
of
a
man
with
a
ragged
staff
from
which
the
place
derives
its
name
and
which
is
the
crest
of
the
reynors
a
conversation
took
place
to
which
at
the
time
i
attached
small
importance
but
which
later
assumed
a
certain
significance
extraordinary
business
said
felix
hulme
that
attempted
burglary
at
sir
julius
studio
last
night
yes
replied
lorian
who
told
you
hulme
appeared
to
be
confused
by
the
abrupt
question
oh
he
replied
i
heard
of
it
from
baxter
who
has
the
next
studio
you
know
when
did
you
see
baxter
asked
lorian
casually
this
morning
i
suppose
said
colonel
reynor
to
my
friend
a
number
of
your
father
drawings
are
there
yes
answered
lorian
slowly
but
the
more
valuable
ones
i
have
at
my
own
studio
including
those
intended
for
use
in
his
book
something
in
his
tone
caused
me
to
glance
hard
at
him
you
do
think
they
were
the
burglar
objective
i
suggested
hardly
was
the
reply
they
would
be
worthless
to
a
thief
first
i
heard
of
this
attempt
lorian
said
edie
anything
missing
no
the
thing
is
an
utter
mystery
there
were
some
odds
and
ends
lying
about
which
no
ordinary
burglar
could
very
well
have
overlooked
if
any
loss
had
been
sustained
said
the
colonel
half
jestingly
i
should
have
put
it
down
to
the
riddle
do
quite
follow
you
colonel
remarked
edie
what
riddle
the
family
riddle
of
the
ragstaffs
explained
lorian
you
seen
it
over
there
by
the
staircase
oh
exclaimed
the
other
you
mean
that
inscription
on
the
panel
which
means
nothing
in
particular
yes
i
have
examined
it
several
times
but
why
should
it
affect
the
fortunes
of
sir
julius
you
see
was
the
colonel
reply
we
have
a
tradition
in
the
family
edie
that
the
riddle
brings
us
luck
but
brings
misfortune
to
anyone
else
who
has
it
in
his
possession
it
never
been
copied
before
but
i
let
lorian
sir
julius
make
a
drawing
of
it
for
his
forthcoming
book
on
decorative
i
do
know
he
added
smilingly
if
the
mysterious
influence
follows
the
copy
or
only
appertains
to
the
original
let
us
have
another
look
at
it
said
edie
it
has
acquired
a
new
interest
the
whole
party
of
us
passed
idly
across
the
hall
to
the
foot
of
the
great
staircase
from
the
direction
of
the
proceeded
the
softly
played
strains
of
the
from
i
knew
sybil
reynor
was
the
player
and
i
saw
lorian
glance
impatiently
in
the
direction
of
the
door
hulme
detected
the
glance
too
and
an
expression
rested
momentarily
upon
his
handsome
face
which
i
found
myself
at
a
loss
to
define
you
see
said
the
colonel
holding
a
candle
close
to
the
panel
it
is
a
meaningless
piece
of
mediæval
doggerel
roughly
carved
in
the
wood
the
border
is
very
fine
so
your
father
tells
me
harry
to
lorian
but
it
is
probably
the
work
of
another
hand
as
is
the
man
and
ragged
staff
which
form
the
shield
at
the
top
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
asked
hulme
that
the
writing
might
be
of
a
very
much
later
date
late
stuart
for
instance
no
replied
the
colonel
abruptly
and
turned
away
i
am
sure
it
is
earlier
than
that
i
was
not
the
only
member
of
the
party
who
noticed
the
curt
tone
of
his
reply
and
when
we
had
all
retired
for
the
night
i
lingered
in
room
and
reverted
to
the
matter
is
the
late
stuart
period
a
sore
point
with
the
colonel
i
asked
lorian
who
was
in
an
unusually
thoughtful
mood
lighted
his
pipe
and
nodded
it
is
said
he
explained
that
a
reynor
at
about
that
time
turned
buccaneer
and
became
the
terror
of
the
two
atlantics
i
do
know
what
possessed
hulme
to
say
such
a
thing
probably
he
does
know
about
the
piratical
page
in
the
family
records
however
he
a
strange
chap
he
is
i
agreed
everybody
seems
to
know
him
yet
nobody
knows
anything
him
i
first
met
him
at
the
travellers
club
i
was
unaware
until
i
came
down
here
this
time
that
the
colonel
was
one
of
his
friends
edie
brought
him
down
first
replied
lorian
but
i
think
hulme
had
met
sybil
miss
reynor
in
london
before
i
may
be
a
silly
ass
but
somehow
i
distrust
the
chap
always
have
he
seems
to
know
altogether
too
much
about
other
people
affairs
i
mentally
added
that
he
also
took
too
great
an
interest
in
a
certain
young
lady
to
suit
lorian
taste
we
chatted
upon
various
matters
principally
upon
the
manners
customs
and
manifold
beauties
of
sybil
reynor
until
my
friend
pipe
went
out
then
i
bade
him
good
night
and
went
to
my
own
room
iii
with
that
abruptness
characteristic
of
the
coast
and
season
a
high
wind
had
sprung
up
since
the
party
had
separated
now
a
continuous
booming
filled
the
night
telling
how
the
wrath
of
the
north
atlantic
spent
itself
upon
the
western
rocks
to
a
more
used
to
the
vaguely
soothing
hum
of
the
metropolis
this
grander
music
of
the
elements
was
a
poor
sedative
sleep
evaded
me
tired
though
i
was
and
i
presently
found
myself
drifting
into
that
uncomfortable
frame
of
mind
between
dreaming
and
waking
wherein
one
brain
becomes
a
torturing
filled
with
some
meaningless
reiteration
the
riddle
of
the
ragged
staff
the
riddle
of
the
ragged
staff
was
the
phrase
that
danced
maddeningly
through
my
brain
it
got
to
that
pass
with
me
familiar
enough
to
victims
of
insomnia
when
the
words
began
to
go
to
a
sort
of
monotonous
melody
thereupon
i
determined
to
light
a
candle
and
read
for
a
while
in
the
hope
of
inducing
slumber
the
old
clock
down
in
the
hall
proclaimed
the
i
glanced
at
my
watch
it
was
one
the
moaning
of
the
wind
and
the
wild
song
of
the
sea
continued
unceasingly
then
i
dropped
my
paper
and
listened
amid
the
mighty
sounds
which
raged
about
ragstaff
park
it
was
one
slight
enough
which
had
attracted
my
attention
but
in
the
elemental
music
there
was
a
sameness
which
rendered
it
after
a
time
negligible
indeed
i
think
sleep
was
not
far
off
when
this
new
sound
detached
itself
from
the
old
like
the
solo
from
its
accompaniment
something
had
fallen
crashingly
within
the
house
it
might
be
some
object
insecurely
fastened
which
had
been
detached
in
the
breeze
from
an
open
window
and
realising
this
i
waited
and
listened
for
some
minutes
the
wind
and
the
waves
alone
represented
sound
then
my
ears
attuned
to
this
stormy
conflict
and
sensitive
to
anything
apart
from
it
detected
a
faint
scratching
and
tapping
my
room
was
the
first
along
the
corridor
leading
to
the
west
wing
and
therefore
the
nearest
to
the
landing
immediately
above
the
hall
i
determined
that
this
mysterious
disturbance
proceeded
from
downstairs
at
another
time
perhaps
i
might
have
neglected
it
but
and
so
recently
following
upon
lorian
story
of
the
attempt
upon
his
father
studio
i
found
myself
keenly
alive
to
the
burglarious
possibilities
of
ragstaff
i
got
out
of
bed
put
on
my
slippers
and
having
extinguished
the
candle
was
about
to
open
the
door
when
i
observed
a
singular
thing
a
strong
light
which
could
not
be
that
of
the
moon
for
ordinarily
the
corridor
beyond
was
dark
shone
under
the
door
even
as
i
looked
in
amazement
it
was
gone
very
softly
i
turned
the
knob
careful
as
i
was
it
slipped
from
my
grasp
with
a
faint
to
this
i
think
i
owed
my
failure
to
see
more
than
i
did
see
but
what
i
saw
was
sufficiently
remarkable
raced
across
the
sky
tempestuously
and
as
i
peered
over
the
oaken
balustrade
down
into
the
hall
one
of
these
impinged
upon
the
moon
disc
and
within
the
space
of
two
seconds
or
less
had
wholly
obscured
it
upon
where
a
long
rectangular
patch
of
light
splashed
with
shadows
spread
from
a
mullioned
window
across
the
polished
floor
crept
a
band
of
blackness
widened
claimed
half
claimed
the
whole
and
left
the
hall
in
darkness
yet
in
the
before
the
coming
of
the
cloud
and
as
i
first
looked
down
i
had
seen
something
something
indefinable
all
but
immediately
it
was
lost
in
the
quick
gliding
shadow
yet
i
could
be
sure
that
i
had
seen
what
a
gleaming
metallic
streak
almost
i
had
said
a
sword
which
leapt
from
my
view
into
the
bank
of
gloom
passing
the
cloud
and
the
moon
anew
cutting
a
line
of
light
through
the
darkness
of
the
hall
nothing
no
one
remained
to
be
seen
i
might
have
imagined
the
presence
of
the
shining
blade
rod
or
whatever
had
seemed
to
glitter
in
the
and
i
should
have
felt
assured
that
such
was
the
case
but
for
the
suspicion
and
it
was
nearly
a
certainty
that
a
part
of
the
shadow
which
had
enwrapped
the
mysterious
appearance
had
been
of
greater
depth
than
the
rest
more
tangible
in
short
had
been
no
shadow
but
a
substance
the
form
of
one
who
lurked
there
doubtful
how
to
act
and
unwilling
to
disturb
the
house
without
good
reason
i
stood
hesitating
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
a
grating
sound
like
that
of
a
rusty
lock
and
clearly
distinguishable
above
the
noise
occasioned
by
the
wind
came
to
my
ears
i
began
slowly
and
silently
to
descend
the
stairs
at
the
foot
i
paused
looking
warily
about
me
there
was
no
one
in
the
hall
a
new
cloud
swept
across
the
face
of
the
moon
and
utter
darkness
surrounded
me
again
i
listened
intently
but
nothing
stirred
briefly
i
searched
all
those
odd
nooks
and
corners
in
which
the
rambling
place
abounded
but
without
discovering
anything
to
account
for
the
phenomena
which
had
brought
me
there
at
that
hour
of
the
night
the
big
doors
were
securely
bolted
as
were
all
the
windows
extremely
puzzled
i
returned
to
my
room
and
to
bed
in
the
morning
i
said
nothing
to
our
host
respecting
the
mysterious
traffic
of
the
night
since
nothing
appeared
to
be
disturbed
in
any
way
did
you
hear
it
blowing
asked
colonel
reynor
during
breakfast
the
booming
of
the
waves
sounded
slap
under
the
house
good
job
the
wind
has
dropped
this
morning
it
was
indeed
a
warm
and
still
morning
when
on
the
moorland
strip
beyond
the
long
cornfield
where
the
thick
marked
the
warren
honeycomb
partridges
might
be
met
with
in
many
coveys
basking
in
the
sandy
patches
there
were
tunnels
through
the
dense
bushes
to
the
west
too
which
led
one
with
alarming
suddenness
to
the
very
brink
of
the
cliff
and
here
went
scurrying
many
a
hare
before
the
armed
intruder
lorian
and
i
worked
around
by
to
the
spinneys
east
of
the
cornfield
and
nothing
loath
to
partake
of
the
substantial
hospitalities
of
ragstaff
made
our
way
up
to
the
house
there
is
a
kind
of
from
which
you
must
approach
from
that
side
it
affords
an
uninterrupted
view
of
the
lower
part
of
the
grounds
from
the
lawn
up
to
the
terrace
only
two
figures
were
in
sight
and
they
must
have
been
invisible
from
any
other
point
as
we
undoubtedly
were
invisible
to
them
they
were
those
of
a
man
and
a
girl
they
stood
upon
the
steps
leading
down
from
the
lawn
to
the
it
was
impossible
to
misunderstand
the
nature
of
the
words
which
the
man
was
speaking
but
i
saw
the
girl
turn
aside
and
shake
her
head
the
man
sought
to
take
her
hand
and
received
a
further
and
more
decided
rebuff
we
hurried
on
lorian
though
i
avoided
looking
directly
at
him
was
biting
his
lip
he
was
very
pale
too
and
i
knew
that
he
had
recognized
as
i
had
recognized
sybil
reynor
and
felix
hulme
iv
during
lunch
a
findon
who
had
driven
over
with
one
of
the
colonel
neighbours
asked
sybil
reynor
whether
the
peculiar
and
far
from
beautiful
ring
which
she
invariably
wore
was
oriental
from
his
conversation
i
gathered
that
he
was
something
of
an
expert
it
is
generally
supposed
to
be
phoenician
findon
she
answered
and
slipping
it
from
her
finger
she
passed
it
to
him
it
is
my
lot
in
life
to
wear
it
always
hideous
though
it
is
indeed
an
heirloom
i
suppose
yes
replied
the
girl
and
an
ugly
one
in
point
of
fact
the
history
of
the
ring
was
as
curious
as
that
of
the
riddle
for
generations
it
had
been
worn
by
the
heir
of
ragstaff
from
the
day
of
his
majority
to
that
of
his
eldest
son
colonel
reynor
had
no
son
hence
following
the
tradition
as
closely
as
circumstances
allowed
he
had
invested
sybil
with
the
ring
upon
the
day
that
she
came
of
age
some
three
months
prior
to
the
time
of
which
i
write
as
findon
was
about
to
return
the
ring
lorian
said
excuse
me
may
i
examine
it
for
a
moment
of
course
replied
sybil
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
bent
over
it
curiously
i
can
not
pretend
to
explain
what
impelled
me
to
glance
towards
hulme
at
that
moment
but
i
did
do
so
and
the
expression
which
rested
upon
his
dark
and
usually
handsome
face
positively
alarmed
me
i
concluded
that
beneath
the
cool
surface
he
was
a
man
of
hot
passions
and
i
would
have
ascribed
the
fixed
glare
to
the
jealousy
of
a
rejected
suitor
in
presence
of
a
more
favoured
rival
had
it
centred
upon
lorian
but
it
appeared
to
be
focused
particularly
upon
the
ring
the
incident
impressed
me
very
unfavourably
a
sense
of
mystery
was
growing
up
around
me
pervading
the
atmosphere
of
ragstaff
park
after
lunch
lorian
and
i
again
set
out
in
company
but
my
friend
appeared
to
be
in
anything
but
sporting
humour
we
bore
off
at
a
sharp
angle
from
the
colonel
and
some
others
who
were
set
upon
the
rough
shooting
on
the
western
rim
of
the
moors
and
made
for
the
honeycombed
ground
which
led
one
upward
to
the
cliff
edge
abruptly
we
found
ourselves
upon
the
sheer
brink
with
the
floor
of
the
ocean
at
our
feet
and
all
the
great
atlantic
before
us
let
us
relent
of
our
murderous
purpose
said
lorian
dropping
comfortably
on
to
a
patch
of
velvety
turf
and
producing
his
pipe
i
have
dragged
you
up
here
with
the
malicious
intention
of
talking
to
you
i
was
not
sorry
to
hear
it
there
was
much
that
i
wished
to
discuss
with
him
i
should
have
stayed
to
say
something
to
some
one
he
added
carefully
stuffing
his
briar
but
first
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
you
he
paused
fumbling
for
matches
what
he
continued
finding
some
and
striking
one
is
felix
hulme
little
game
he
wants
to
marry
miss
reynor
i
know
but
he
need
get
so
infernally
savage
because
she
accept
him
he
looked
at
me
in
a
positively
murderous
way
at
lunch
so
you
noticed
that
yes
and
i
saw
that
you
noticed
it
too
listen
i
said
leaving
hulme
out
of
the
question
there
is
an
altogether
more
mysterious
business
afoot
and
i
told
him
of
the
episode
of
the
previous
night
he
smoked
stolidly
whilst
i
spoke
frowning
the
while
then
old
chap
he
said
i
begin
to
have
a
sort
of
glimmering
of
intelligence
i
believe
i
am
threatened
with
an
idea
but
it
such
an
utterly
fantastic
hybrid
that
i
dare
not
name
it
yet
he
asked
me
several
questions
respecting
what
i
had
seen
and
my
replies
appeared
to
confirm
whatever
suspicion
was
gathering
in
his
mind
we
saw
little
enough
sport
but
came
in
later
than
anyone
during
dinner
there
was
an
odd
incident
lorian
said
colonel
mind
my
taking
a
picture
of
the
riddle
eh
said
the
colonel
what
for
your
father
made
a
drawing
of
it
yes
i
know
replied
lorian
i
mean
a
photograph
well
mused
the
colonel
i
do
know
that
there
can
be
much
objection
since
it
has
been
copied
once
but
have
you
got
a
camera
here
ah
no
said
my
friend
thoughtfully
i
have
can
anybody
lend
me
one
apparently
no
one
could
if
you
care
to
drive
over
to
mason
after
dinner
said
our
host
he
will
lend
you
one
he
has
several
lorian
said
he
would
and
i
volunteered
to
accompany
him
accordingly
the
colonel
high
dogcart
was
prepared
and
beneath
a
perfect
moon
swimming
in
a
fleckless
sky
which
gave
no
hint
of
the
storm
to
come
we
set
off
for
the
doctor
my
friend
manoeuvres
were
a
constant
source
of
surprise
to
me
however
i
allowed
him
to
know
his
own
business
best
and
employed
my
mind
with
speculations
respecting
this
mystery
what
time
the
spirited
grey
whisked
us
along
the
dusty
roads
we
had
just
wheeled
around
mason
drive
when
the
fact
broke
in
upon
my
musings
that
a
stygian
darkness
had
descended
upon
the
night
as
though
the
moon
had
been
snuffed
devil
of
a
storm
brewing
said
lorian
funny
how
the
weather
changes
at
night
two
minutes
after
entering
the
doctor
cosy
study
down
came
the
rain
now
we
in
for
it
said
mason
i
send
wilkins
to
run
the
dogcart
into
the
stable
until
it
blows
over
the
storm
proved
to
be
a
severe
one
and
long
past
midnight
despite
the
doctor
hospitable
attempts
to
detain
us
we
set
off
for
ragstaff
park
we
can
put
up
the
grey
ourselves
said
lorian
i
love
grooming
horses
and
by
going
around
into
the
yard
and
throwing
gravel
up
at
his
window
we
can
awaken
peters
without
arousing
the
house
this
plan
almost
startles
me
by
its
daring
originality
i
fear
that
i
detect
within
myself
the
symptoms
of
genius
so
with
one
of
mason
cameras
under
the
seat
we
started
back
through
the
lanes
and
at
about
twenty
minutes
past
one
swung
past
the
gate
lodge
and
up
the
long
avenue
the
wheels
grinding
crisply
upon
the
newly
wetted
gravel
there
was
but
little
moon
now
and
the
house
stood
up
an
irregular
black
mass
before
us
then
from
three
of
the
windows
there
suddenly
leapt
out
a
dazzling
white
light
lorian
pulled
up
the
grey
with
a
jerk
good
god
he
said
what
that
an
explosion
but
no
sound
reached
us
only
for
some
seconds
the
hard
white
glare
streamed
out
upon
the
steps
and
down
on
to
the
drive
suddenly
as
it
had
come
it
was
gone
and
the
whole
of
ragstaff
was
in
darkness
as
before
the
horse
started
nervously
but
my
friend
held
him
with
a
firm
hand
turning
and
looking
at
me
queerly
that
what
shone
under
your
door
last
night
he
said
that
light
was
in
the
hall
v
peters
was
awakened
the
horse
stabled
and
ourselves
admitted
without
arousing
another
soul
as
we
came
around
from
the
back
of
the
house
we
had
not
entered
by
the
main
door
and
candles
in
hand
passed
through
the
hall
nothing
showed
as
having
been
disturbed
do
breathe
a
word
of
our
suspicions
to
anyone
counselled
lorian
what
our
suspicions
said
i
at
present
he
replied
indefinable
the
distant
murmur
of
the
sea
proved
very
soothing
and
i
slept
soundly
i
was
early
afoot
however
but
not
so
early
as
lorian
as
i
passed
around
the
gallery
above
the
hall
on
my
way
to
the
bathroom
i
saw
him
folding
up
the
tripod
of
the
camera
which
he
had
borrowed
from
mason
the
morning
sun
was
streaming
through
the
windows
hullo
lorian
called
to
me
i
got
a
splendid
negative
i
think
peters
is
rigging
up
a
in
the
delightful
site
for
the
purpose
will
you
join
me
in
developing
although
i
was
unable
to
conjecture
what
my
friend
hoped
to
gain
by
his
photographic
experiments
i
agreed
prompted
as
much
by
curiosity
as
anything
else
so
after
my
tub
i
descended
to
the
cellar
and
splashed
about
in
until
lorian
declared
himself
satisfied
the
second
is
the
best
he
pronounced
critically
holding
the
negative
up
to
the
red
lamp
i
made
three
exposures
in
all
but
the
reflection
from
the
polished
wood
has
rather
spoiled
the
first
and
also
the
third
whatever
do
you
want
with
this
photograph
anyway
i
said
when
the
original
is
available
my
dear
chap
he
replied
one
can
not
squat
in
the
hall
fixedly
regarding
a
section
of
panel
like
some
fakir
staring
at
a
palm
leaf
then
you
intend
to
study
it
closely
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
join
us
during
the
whole
of
the
day
but
since
he
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
time
in
his
own
room
i
did
not
proffer
my
aid
from
a
remark
dropped
by
the
colonel
i
gathered
that
sybil
had
volunteered
to
assist
during
the
afternoon
in
preparing
prints
i
was
one
of
the
first
in
to
tea
and
lorian
came
racing
out
to
meet
me
not
a
word
yet
he
said
but
if
the
colonel
is
agreeable
i
shall
tell
them
all
at
dinner
tell
them
what
i
began
then
i
saw
sybil
reynor
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
porch
and
even
from
that
distance
saw
her
rosy
blushes
i
understood
lucky
man
i
cried
and
wrung
his
hand
warmly
the
very
best
of
good
wishes
old
chap
i
am
delighted
so
am
i
replied
lorian
but
come
and
see
the
print
we
went
into
the
house
together
and
sybil
blushed
more
furiously
than
ever
when
i
told
her
how
i
envied
lorian
and
added
that
he
deserved
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
england
and
had
won
her
lorian
had
a
very
clear
print
of
the
photograph
pinned
up
to
dry
on
the
side
of
his
window
we
shall
be
busy
he
said
mysteriously
he
had
planned
to
preserve
his
great
secret
until
but
of
course
it
came
out
whilst
we
sat
over
tea
on
the
balcony
the
colonel
was
unfeignedly
delighted
and
there
is
nothing
secretive
about
colonel
reynor
consequently
five
minutes
after
he
had
been
informed
how
matters
were
between
his
daughter
and
lorian
all
the
house
knew
i
studied
the
face
of
hulme
to
see
how
he
would
take
the
news
but
he
retained
a
perfect
mastery
of
himself
though
his
large
dark
eyes
gleamed
at
discord
with
the
smile
which
he
wore
our
photographic
experiments
were
forgotten
and
throughout
dinner
whereat
sybil
looked
exquisitely
lovely
and
very
shy
and
lorian
preserved
an
unruffled
countenance
other
topics
ruled
it
was
late
before
we
found
ourselves
alone
in
lorian
room
with
the
print
spread
upon
the
table
beneath
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
we
bent
over
it
now
said
lorian
i
assume
that
this
is
some
kind
of
cipher
i
stared
at
him
surprisedly
and
he
continued
you
and
i
are
going
to
solve
it
if
we
sit
up
all
night
how
do
you
propose
to
begin
well
as
it
appears
to
mean
nothing
in
particular
as
it
stands
i
thought
of
beginning
by
assuming
that
the
letters
have
other
values
altogether
therefore
upon
the
basis
that
is
the
letter
which
most
frequently
occurs
in
english
with
afterwards
i
had
thought
of
resolving
it
into
its
component
letters
but
would
that
rule
apply
to
mediæval
english
ah
said
lorian
thoughtfully
most
sage
counsellor
a
wise
and
timely
thought
i
afraid
it
would
what
now
lorian
scratched
his
head
in
perplexity
suppose
he
suggested
we
write
down
the
words
plainly
and
see
if
treating
each
one
separately
we
can
find
other
meanings
to
them
accordingly
upon
a
sheet
of
paper
i
wrote
wherso
eer
thee
doome
bee
looke
untoe
ye
strypped
tree
offe
ragged
staffe
upon
itte
ley
golde
toe
greene
ande
kay
toe
kay
our
efforts
in
the
proposed
direction
were
rewarded
with
poor
success
some
gibberish
even
less
intelligible
than
the
original
was
the
only
result
of
our
labour
lorian
threw
down
his
pencil
and
began
to
reload
his
pipe
let
us
consider
possible
meanings
to
the
original
words
he
said
do
you
know
of
anything
in
the
neighbourhood
which
might
answer
to
the
description
of
a
tree
i
shook
my
head
what
has
occasioned
your
sudden
interest
in
the
thing
i
asked
wearily
it
is
a
long
story
he
replied
and
i
have
an
idea
that
there
no
time
to
be
lost
in
solving
the
riddle
however
even
lorian
enthusiasm
flagged
at
last
we
were
forced
to
admit
ourselves
hopelessly
beaten
by
the
riddle
i
went
to
my
own
room
feeling
thoroughly
tired
but
i
was
not
destined
to
sleep
long
a
few
minutes
after
closing
my
eyes
or
so
it
seemed
came
a
clamouring
at
the
door
i
stumbled
sleepily
out
of
bed
and
slipping
on
my
admitted
lorian
colonel
reynor
stood
immediately
behind
him
most
extraordinary
business
began
the
latter
breathlessly
sybil
had
tell
him
harry
well
said
lorian
it
is
not
unexpected
listen
sybil
woke
up
a
while
ago
with
the
idea
that
she
had
forgotten
something
or
lost
something
you
know
the
frame
of
mind
she
went
to
her
and
found
the
family
ring
missing
ring
burst
in
the
colonel
excitedly
amazing
she
remembered
having
taken
it
off
during
the
evening
to
er
to
put
another
one
on
but
she
was
unable
to
recall
having
replaced
it
she
determined
to
run
down
and
see
if
she
had
left
it
upon
the
seat
in
the
corner
of
the
library
well
she
went
downstairs
in
her
and
carrying
a
candle
very
quietly
in
order
to
wake
no
one
crossed
to
the
library
and
searched
unavailingly
she
heard
a
faint
noise
outside
in
the
hall
lorian
paused
felix
hulme
had
joined
the
party
what
the
disturbance
he
asked
oh
said
lorian
turning
to
him
it
about
sybil
she
was
down
in
the
library
a
while
ago
to
look
for
something
and
heard
a
sort
of
grating
sound
out
in
the
hall
she
came
out
and
almost
fell
over
an
chest
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
which
stood
near
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
good
heavens
lorian
i
cried
how
had
it
come
there
sybil
says
he
resumed
that
she
could
not
believe
her
eyes
she
stooped
to
examine
the
thing
and
with
a
thrill
of
horror
saw
it
to
be
roughly
marked
a
skull
and
my
dear
lorian
said
hulme
are
you
certain
that
miss
reynor
was
awake
she
woke
quickly
enough
interrupted
the
colonel
poor
girl
she
was
shaking
dreadfully
thought
it
was
a
supernatural
appearance
with
her
mother
now
but
the
box
i
cried
where
is
the
box
that
the
mystery
answered
colonel
reynor
i
was
downstairs
two
minutes
later
and
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
to
be
seen
has
our
ragstaff
ghost
started
walking
again
i
wonder
you
ought
to
know
hulme
you
in
the
turret
room
that
is
the
authentic
haunted
chamber
i
was
aroused
by
the
bell
ringing
replied
hulme
i
am
a
very
light
sleeper
but
i
heard
or
saw
nothing
supernatural
by
the
way
hulme
said
my
friend
the
turret
room
is
directly
above
the
hall
i
have
a
theory
might
i
come
up
with
you
for
a
moment
certainly
replied
hulme
we
all
went
up
to
the
turret
room
having
climbed
the
stairs
to
this
apartment
you
enter
it
by
descending
three
steps
it
is
octagonal
and
panelled
all
around
my
friend
tapped
the
panels
and
sounded
all
the
oaken
then
professing
himself
satisfied
he
bade
hulme
good
night
and
accompanied
me
to
my
room
vi
ragstaff
park
slumbered
once
more
but
lorian
sat
upon
the
edge
of
my
bed
smoking
and
thinking
hard
he
had
been
to
his
own
room
for
the
print
of
the
riddle
and
it
lay
upon
a
chair
before
him
listen
to
this
he
said
suddenly
some
one
breaks
into
the
governor
studio
and
takes
nothing
his
drawings
of
the
ragstaff
riddle
happen
to
be
at
my
studio
you
hear
a
noise
in
the
night
and
see
a
bright
light
a
gleaming
rod
you
and
i
see
a
bright
light
on
the
following
night
and
presumably
proceeding
from
the
same
place
the
hall
something
i
have
not
mentioned
before
hulme
has
a
camera
in
his
kit
and
he
does
want
the
fact
known
what
do
you
mean
i
tested
him
the
other
night
by
inquiring
if
anyone
could
lend
me
a
camera
he
did
not
volunteer
the
morning
following
the
mysterious
business
in
the
hall
observed
by
you
i
saw
a
photographic
printing
frame
in
his
window
he
must
have
one
of
those
portable
developers
with
him
and
to
what
does
all
this
point
to
the
fact
that
he
has
made
at
least
three
attempts
to
obtain
a
copy
of
the
riddle
and
has
at
last
succeeded
three
i
really
think
so
the
evidence
points
to
him
as
the
person
who
broke
into
the
studio
he
made
a
bad
slip
he
referred
to
the
matter
and
cited
horace
baxter
as
his
informant
baxter
is
away
but
this
is
serious
i
should
say
so
he
could
attempt
to
photograph
the
panel
in
daylight
so
he
employed
magnesium
ribbon
at
night
first
time
his
tripod
slipped
it
is
evidently
one
of
the
light
telescopic
kind
his
negative
proved
useless
it
was
one
of
the
metal
legs
of
the
tripod
which
you
saw
shining
the
second
time
he
was
more
successful
that
was
the
light
of
his
magnesium
ribbon
you
and
i
saw
from
the
drive
but
lorian
i
went
down
and
searched
the
hall
now
we
come
on
to
the
at
present
conjectural
part
explained
lorian
my
theory
is
that
hulme
somewhere
or
other
has
come
across
some
old
documents
which
give
the
clue
to
those
secret
passages
said
to
exist
in
ragstaff
but
which
the
colonel
has
never
been
able
to
locate
i
feel
assured
that
there
is
some
means
of
secret
communication
between
the
turret
room
and
the
hall
i
further
believe
that
hulme
has
in
some
way
got
upon
the
track
of
another
secret
that
of
the
riddle
but
what
the
secret
of
the
riddle
in
my
opinion
the
riddle
is
a
clue
to
another
evidently
not
connected
with
the
maze
of
passages
possibly
what
is
known
as
a
priest
hole
as
you
know
hulme
asked
sybil
to
marry
him
i
believe
the
man
to
be
in
financial
straits
so
that
we
must
further
assume
the
riddle
to
conceal
the
whereabouts
of
a
treasure
since
the
reynors
are
far
from
wealthy
the
lorian
the
chest
i
cried
quite
so
but
what
immediately
preceded
its
appearance
the
loss
of
the
family
ring
if
i
am
not
greatly
in
error
hulme
found
that
ring
and
the
ring
is
the
key
to
the
riddle
do
you
recall
the
shape
of
the
bezel
simply
square
peg
of
look
at
the
photograph
he
was
excited
for
once
what
does
it
say
he
continued
strypped
tree
that
means
the
device
of
leaves
twigs
and
acorns
stripped
a
tree
see
here
at
the
bottom
of
the
panel
is
such
a
group
and
this
is
where
we
have
been
so
blind
intertwined
with
the
design
is
the
word
ancient
saxon
for
look
toe
greene
and
kay
toe
kay
amongst
the
leaves
is
a
square
hole
the
knob
on
the
ring
fits
it
for
a
moment
i
was
too
greatly
surprised
for
speech
then
you
think
hulme
discovered
this
i
do
and
i
think
sybil
mislaying
her
ring
gave
him
his
big
chance
he
had
got
the
chest
out
whilst
she
was
in
the
library
he
must
have
been
inside
somewhere
looking
for
it
when
she
passed
through
the
hall
then
hearing
her
approach
from
the
library
he
was
forced
to
abandon
his
heavy
and
hide
in
the
secret
passage
which
communicates
with
his
room
directly
she
ran
upstairs
he
returned
for
the
chest
i
looked
him
hard
in
the
face
we
do
want
a
scene
lorian
i
began
besides
it
just
possible
you
may
be
wrong
i
agree
said
lorian
come
up
to
his
room
now
passing
quietly
upstairs
we
paused
before
the
door
of
the
turret
room
a
faint
light
showed
under
it
lorian
glanced
at
me
then
knocked
who
there
came
sharply
lorian
answered
my
friend
i
want
a
chat
with
you
about
the
secret
passage
and
the
old
treasure
chest
speaking
to
the
there
was
a
long
silence
then
just
a
moment
came
hoarsely
do
come
in
until
i
call
we
looked
at
one
another
doubtfully
a
long
minute
passed
i
could
hear
a
faint
sound
within
at
last
came
hulme
voice
all
right
come
in
as
lorian
threw
the
door
open
a
faint
sounded
from
somewhere
the
turret
room
was
empty
by
heaven
he
given
us
the
slip
cried
my
friend
we
glanced
around
the
room
a
candle
burnt
upon
the
table
and
upon
the
bed
stood
an
chest
with
a
sheet
of
notepaper
lying
on
its
lid
lorian
pounced
upon
the
note
we
read
it
together
henry
lorian
it
went
i
realize
that
you
have
found
me
out
i
will
confess
that
i
had
no
time
to
open
the
chest
but
as
matters
stand
i
only
ask
you
not
to
pursue
me
i
have
taken
nothing
not
my
own
the
ring
and
an
interesting
document
which
i
picked
up
some
years
ago
are
on
the
table
offer
what
explanation
of
my
disappearance
you
please
i
am
in
your
hands
we
turned
again
to
the
table
upon
a
piece
of
worn
parchment
lay
the
missing
ring
lorian
spread
out
the
parchment
and
bent
over
it
why
i
cried
it
is
a
plan
of
ragstaff
park
with
a
perfect
network
of
secret
passages
added
my
friend
and
some
instructions
apparently
as
to
how
to
enter
them
it
bears
the
initials
and
in
brackets
i
begin
to
understand
he
raised
the
candle
and
stepped
across
to
the
ancient
chest
it
bore
a
roughly
designed
skull
and
and
in
nearly
defaced
red
characters
the
words
captain
satan
i
said
he
was
one
of
the
most
bloodthirsty
pirates
who
ever
harried
the
spanish
main
he
was
agreed
lorian
and
his
real
name
was
roderick
reynor
he
evidently
solved
the
riddle
some
generations
earlier
than
hulme
and
stored
his
bloodstained
hoard
in
the
ancient
also
you
see
he
knew
about
the
passages
what
shall
we
do
hulme
has
surrendered
you
can
see
that
the
chest
has
not
been
opened
therefore
there
is
only
one
thing
that
we
do
we
must
keep
what
we
know
to
ourselves
return
the
chest
to
its
and
proclaim
that
we
have
found
the
missing
ring
down
to
the
hall
we
bore
the
heavy
chest
the
square
knob
on
the
ring
fitted
as
lorian
had
predicted
into
the
hole
half
hidden
among
the
oak
leaves
of
the
design
without
much
difficulty
we
forced
back
the
fastening
it
proved
to
be
of
a
very
simple
pattern
and
slid
the
whole
panel
aside
a
small
square
chamber
was
revealed
by
the
light
of
the
candle
quite
empty
as
i
had
surmised
said
my
friend
a
priest
hole
we
carried
the
chest
within
and
reclosed
the
panel
which
came
to
with
a
sharp
the
story
which
we
invented
to
account
for
hulme
sudden
departure
passed
muster
for
one
topic
usurped
the
interests
of
all
the
ghostly
box
with
its
piratical
emblem
my
boy
colonel
reynor
said
to
lorian
i
can
not
pretend
to
explain
what
sybil
saw
but
it
bears
curiously
upon
a
certain
black
page
in
the
family
history
if
the
chest
had
been
tangible
and
had
contained
a
fortune
i
would
not
have
opened
it
let
all
pertaining
to
that
part
of
our
records
remain
buried
say
i
which
determines
our
course
explained
lorian
to
me
the
chest
is
not
ours
and
the
colonel
evidently
would
rather
not
know
about
it
i
regret
that
i
lack
the
morals
of
a
burglar
the
master
of
hollow
grange
i
jack
dillon
came
to
hollow
grange
on
a
thunderous
black
evening
when
an
ebony
cloud
crested
the
above
and
catching
the
upflung
rays
of
sunset
glowed
redly
like
the
pall
of
avalon
in
the
torchlight
through
the
dense
ranks
of
firs
cloaking
the
slopes
a
breeze
presaging
the
coming
storm
whispered
evilly
and
here
in
the
hollow
the
birds
were
still
the
man
who
had
driven
him
from
the
station
glanced
at
him
with
a
curiosity
thinly
veiled
what
about
your
things
sir
he
inquired
dillon
stared
rather
blankly
at
the
lodge
which
if
appearances
were
to
be
trusted
was
unoccupied
wait
a
moment
i
will
ring
he
said
curtly
for
this
furtive
curiosity
so
ill
concealed
had
manifested
itself
in
the
manner
of
the
from
the
moment
that
dillon
had
directed
him
to
drive
to
hollow
grange
he
pushed
open
the
gate
and
tugged
at
the
iron
ring
which
was
suspended
from
the
wall
of
the
lodge
a
discordant
clangour
rewarded
his
efforts
the
cracked
note
of
a
bell
that
spoke
from
somewhere
high
up
in
the
building
that
seemed
to
be
buffeted
to
and
fro
from
fir
to
fir
until
it
died
away
mournfully
in
some
place
of
shadows
far
up
the
slope
in
the
voice
of
the
bell
there
was
something
furtive
something
akin
to
the
curiosity
in
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
stood
watching
him
something
fearful
too
in
both
as
though
man
and
bell
would
whisper
return
beware
of
disturbing
the
dwellers
in
this
place
but
dillon
angrily
recalled
himself
to
the
realities
he
felt
that
these
ghostly
imaginings
were
born
of
the
flesh
were
products
of
lowered
tone
that
he
would
have
perceived
no
query
in
the
glance
of
the
and
heard
no
monkish
whisper
in
the
clang
of
the
bell
had
he
been
fit
had
he
been
fully
recovered
from
the
effects
of
his
wound
monkish
whisper
yes
that
was
it
his
mind
had
supplied
automatically
an
aptly
descriptive
term
the
cracked
bell
spoke
with
the
voice
of
ancient
monasteries
had
in
it
the
hush
of
cloisters
and
the
sigh
of
renunciation
hang
it
all
muttered
dillon
this
wo
do
a
second
time
he
awoke
the
ghostly
but
nothing
responded
to
its
call
man
bird
and
beast
had
seemingly
deserted
hollow
grange
he
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
nervous
irritation
as
he
turned
brusquely
and
met
the
inquiring
glance
of
the
i
have
arrived
before
i
was
expected
he
said
if
you
will
put
my
things
in
the
porch
here
i
will
go
up
to
the
house
and
get
a
servant
to
fetch
them
they
will
be
safe
enough
in
the
meantime
his
own
words
increased
his
irritability
for
were
they
not
in
the
nature
of
an
apology
on
behalf
of
his
silent
and
unseen
host
were
they
not
a
concession
to
that
nameless
query
in
the
man
stare
moreover
deep
within
his
own
consciousness
some
vague
thing
was
stirring
so
that
the
man
dismissed
and
promptly
departing
dillon
stood
glancing
from
the
little
stack
of
baggage
in
the
lodge
porch
up
the
gloomy
narrow
and
drive
indignantly
aware
that
he
also
carried
a
question
in
his
eyes
the
throb
of
the
motor
mounting
the
steep
winding
lane
grew
dim
and
more
dim
until
it
was
borne
away
entirely
upon
the
fitful
breeze
faintly
he
detected
the
lowing
of
cattle
in
some
distant
pasture
the
ranks
of
firs
whispered
secretly
one
to
another
and
the
pall
above
the
hills
grew
blacker
and
began
to
extend
over
the
valley
amid
that
ominous
stillness
of
nature
he
began
to
ascend
the
path
evidently
enough
the
extensive
grounds
had
been
neglected
for
years
and
that
few
pedestrians
and
fewer
vehicles
ever
sought
hollow
grange
was
demonstrated
by
the
presence
of
luxuriant
weeds
in
the
carriage
way
having
proceeded
for
some
distance
until
the
sheer
hillside
seemed
to
loom
over
him
like
the
wall
of
a
tower
dillon
paused
peering
about
in
the
darkness
he
was
aware
of
a
physical
chill
certainly
no
ray
of
sunlight
ever
penetrated
to
this
tunnel
through
the
firs
could
he
have
mistaken
the
path
and
be
proceeding
not
toward
the
house
but
away
from
it
and
into
the
midnight
of
the
woods
mantling
the
hills
there
was
something
uncomfortable
in
that
reflection
momentarily
he
knew
a
childish
fear
of
the
darkening
woods
and
walked
forward
rapidly
ten
paces
brought
him
to
one
of
the
many
bends
in
the
winding
road
and
there
far
ahead
as
though
out
of
some
cavern
in
the
very
hillside
a
yellow
light
shone
he
pressed
on
with
greater
assurance
until
the
house
became
visible
now
he
perceived
that
he
had
indeed
strayed
from
the
in
some
way
for
the
path
that
he
was
following
terminated
at
the
foot
of
a
short
flight
of
brick
steps
he
mounted
the
steps
and
found
himself
at
the
bottom
of
a
terrace
the
main
entrance
was
far
to
his
left
and
separated
from
the
terrace
by
a
neglected
lawn
that
portion
of
the
place
was
hanoverian
and
ugly
whilst
the
wing
nearest
to
him
was
tudor
and
picturesque
excepting
the
yellow
light
shining
out
from
a
sunken
window
almost
at
his
feet
no
illuminations
were
visible
about
the
house
although
the
brewing
storm
had
already
plunged
the
hollow
into
premature
night
indeed
there
was
no
sign
of
occupancy
about
the
mansion
which
might
have
hidden
forgotten
for
centuries
in
the
horseshoe
of
the
hills
he
had
sought
for
rest
and
quiet
here
he
should
find
them
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
of
that
sort
which
almost
seems
to
be
palpable
that
can
be
seen
and
felt
a
humid
chill
arose
apparently
from
the
terrace
with
its
stone
pavings
outlined
in
moss
crept
up
from
the
wilderness
below
and
down
from
the
above
a
thought
struggled
to
assume
form
in
his
mind
there
was
something
reminiscent
about
this
house
of
the
woods
this
silent
house
which
struck
no
chord
of
human
companionship
in
which
was
no
warmth
of
life
or
love
suddenly
the
thought
leapt
into
complete
being
this
was
the
palace
of
the
sleeping
beauty
to
which
he
had
penetrated
it
was
the
dear
to
childhood
which
had
been
struggling
for
expression
in
his
mind
ever
since
he
had
emerged
from
the
trees
on
to
the
desolate
terrace
with
the
departure
of
the
station
cab
had
gone
the
last
link
with
and
now
he
was
translated
to
the
goblin
realm
of
fable
he
had
crossed
the
terrace
and
the
lawn
and
stood
looking
through
an
open
french
window
into
a
room
that
evidently
adjoined
the
hall
a
great
still
darkness
had
come
and
on
a
little
table
in
the
room
a
was
burning
it
had
a
quaint
mosaic
shade
which
shut
in
much
of
the
light
but
threw
a
luminous
patch
directly
on
a
heap
of
cushions
strewn
upon
the
floor
face
downward
in
this
silken
nest
her
chin
resting
upon
her
hands
and
her
elfin
curly
brown
hair
tousled
bewitchingly
lay
a
girl
so
audaciously
pretty
that
dillon
hesitated
to
accept
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
the
crunching
of
a
piece
of
gravel
beneath
his
foot
led
to
the
awakening
of
the
sleeping
beauty
she
raised
her
head
quickly
and
then
started
upright
a
lithe
divinely
petite
figure
in
a
green
velvet
dress
having
short
sleeves
that
displayed
her
pretty
arms
for
an
instant
it
was
a
startled
nymph
that
confronted
him
then
a
distracting
dimple
appeared
in
one
fair
cheek
and
oh
how
you
frightened
me
said
the
girl
speaking
with
a
slight
french
accent
which
the
visitor
found
wholly
entrancing
you
must
be
jack
dillon
i
am
phryné
dillon
bowed
how
i
envy
hyperides
he
said
a
blush
quickly
stained
the
lovely
face
of
phryné
and
the
roguish
eyes
were
lowered
whereby
the
penitent
dillon
who
had
jested
in
the
not
uncommon
belief
that
a
pretty
girl
is
necessarily
brainless
knew
that
the
story
of
the
of
thespiæ
was
familiar
to
her
modern
namesake
i
am
afraid
declared
phryné
with
a
return
of
her
mischievous
composure
that
you
are
very
wicked
dillon
who
counted
himself
a
man
of
the
world
was
temporarily
at
a
loss
for
a
suitable
rejoinder
the
cause
of
his
hesitancy
was
twofold
in
the
first
place
he
had
reached
the
age
of
disillusionment
whereat
a
man
ceases
to
believe
that
a
perfectly
lovely
woman
exists
in
the
flesh
and
in
the
second
place
he
had
found
such
a
fabulous
being
in
a
house
of
gloom
and
silence
to
which
a
few
moments
ago
he
had
deeply
regretted
having
come
his
father
who
had
accepted
the
invitation
from
an
old
college
friend
on
his
son
behalf
had
made
no
mention
of
a
phryné
whereas
phryné
clearly
took
herself
for
granted
and
evidently
knew
all
about
jack
dillon
the
latter
experienced
a
volcanic
change
of
sentiment
hollow
grange
was
metamorphosed
and
assumed
magically
the
guise
of
a
golden
house
an
emperor
pleasure
palace
a
fair
casket
holding
this
lovely
jewel
but
who
was
she
and
in
what
spirit
should
he
receive
her
bewildering
coquetries
i
trust
he
said
looking
into
the
laughing
eyes
that
you
will
learn
to
know
me
better
phryné
curtsied
mockingly
you
have
either
too
much
confidence
in
your
own
character
or
not
enough
in
my
wisdom
she
said
dillon
stepped
into
the
room
and
stooping
took
up
a
book
which
lay
open
upon
the
floor
it
was
a
french
edition
of
golden
of
apuleius
the
hollow
was
illuminated
by
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
and
phryné
musical
laughter
was
drowned
in
the
thunder
that
boomed
and
crashed
in
deepening
peals
over
the
hills
in
a
sudden
tropical
torrent
the
rain
descended
as
kassimere
entered
the
room
ii
jack
dillon
leant
from
his
open
window
and
looked
out
over
the
valley
to
where
a
dull
red
glow
crowned
the
there
was
a
fire
somewhere
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
distant
town
probably
a
building
had
been
struck
by
lightning
the
storm
had
passed
although
thunder
was
still
audible
dimly
like
the
roll
of
muffled
drums
or
a
remote
bombardment
stillness
had
reclaimed
hollow
grange
he
was
restless
uneasy
he
sought
to
collate
his
impressions
of
the
place
and
its
master
twelve
years
had
elapsed
since
his
one
previous
meeting
with
kassimere
and
little
or
no
memory
of
the
man
had
remained
so
much
had
intervened
the
war
and
phryné
now
that
he
was
alone
and
could
collect
his
ideas
he
knew
of
what
kassimere
gaunt
face
had
reminded
him
it
was
of
thoth
the
god
whose
figure
he
had
seen
on
the
walls
of
the
temples
during
his
service
in
egypt
kassimere
was
always
a
queer
fish
jack
his
father
had
said
but
most
of
his
eccentricities
were
due
to
his
passion
for
study
the
grange
is
the
very
place
sir
francis
the
specialist
would
have
chosen
for
your
convalescence
and
you
find
nothing
dangerously
exciting
in
kassimere
atmosphere
yet
there
was
that
about
kassimere
which
he
did
not
and
could
not
like
his
quietly
cordial
welcome
his
courteous
regret
that
his
arrival
by
an
earlier
train
a
circumstance
due
to
reduced
service
had
led
to
his
not
being
met
at
the
station
the
charming
simplicity
with
which
he
confessed
to
the
smallness
of
his
household
and
to
the
pleasure
which
it
afforded
him
to
have
the
son
of
an
old
chum
beneath
his
roof
all
these
kindly
overtures
had
left
the
eyes
cold
hard
watchful
calculating
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
friend
and
a
gentleman
but
the
face
was
the
face
of
thoth
the
mystery
of
phryné
was
solved
in
a
measure
she
was
adopted
daughter
and
the
orphaned
child
of
louis
devant
the
famous
paris
cartoonist
who
had
died
penniless
in
at
the
height
of
his
success
in
his
selection
of
a
name
for
her
the
brilliant
and
dissolute
artist
had
exhibited
a
breadth
of
mind
which
phryné
inherited
in
an
almost
embarrassing
degree
her
mental
equipment
was
bewildering
the
erudition
of
an
oxford
don
spiced
with
more
than
a
dash
of
boul
mich
which
made
for
complexity
her
curious
learning
was
doubtless
due
to
the
setting
of
a
receptive
mind
amid
such
environment
but
how
she
had
retained
her
piquant
vivacity
in
hollow
grange
was
less
comprehensible
the
servants
formed
a
small
and
saturnine
company
only
two
the
housekeeper
harman
a
black
and
forbidding
figure
and
madame
charny
a
french
companion
sleeping
in
the
house
gawly
a
surly
creature
who
neglected
the
gardens
and
muttered
savagely
over
other
duties
together
with
his
wife
who
cooked
resided
at
the
lodge
there
were
two
maids
who
lived
in
the
village
the
glow
from
the
distant
fire
seemed
to
be
reflected
upon
the
firs
bordering
the
terrace
below
then
dillon
watching
the
dull
red
light
remembered
that
kassimere
laboratory
adjoined
the
tiny
chapel
and
that
though
midnight
drew
near
the
doctor
was
still
at
work
there
owls
and
other
night
birds
hooted
and
shrieked
among
the
trees
and
many
bats
were
in
flight
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
pyramid
bats
of
egypt
and
of
the
thoth
who
was
the
scribe
of
the
kassimere
had
made
himself
medically
responsible
for
his
case
and
had
read
attentively
the
letters
which
dillon
had
brought
from
his
own
physician
he
was
to
prescribe
on
the
following
day
and
the
visitor
found
morpheus
a
treacherous
god
furtive
activities
disturbed
the
house
or
so
it
seemed
to
the
sleepless
man
tossing
on
his
bed
alert
intelligences
within
hollow
grange
responded
to
the
of
the
owls
without
and
he
seemed
to
lie
in
the
shadow
of
a
watchfulness
that
never
slumbered
iii
there
many
a
fine
walk
hereabouts
said
the
old
man
seated
in
the
in
the
corner
of
the
dillon
nodded
encouragingly
there
continued
the
ancient
you
can
see
the
sea
from
there
in
clear
weather
and
many
the
time
i
heard
the
guns
in
france
from
upper
crobury
of
a
still
night
then
four
mile
away
there
the
haunted
grange
though
nobody
allowed
past
the
gate
not
as
nobody
wants
to
be
he
added
reflectively
the
haunted
grange
questioned
dillon
where
is
that
hollow
grange
said
the
old
man
why
it
lies
oh
hollow
grange
yes
i
know
where
hollow
grange
is
but
i
was
unaware
that
it
was
reputed
to
be
haunted
ah
replied
the
other
pityingly
you
new
to
these
parts
i
see
that
the
minute
i
set
eyes
on
you
maybe
you
was
wounded
in
france
and
you
down
here
to
get
well
like
quite
so
your
deductive
reasoning
is
admirable
ah
said
the
sage
chuckling
with
i
ai
lived
in
these
here
parts
for
nigh
on
years
without
learning
to
use
my
eyes
i
ai
for
years
and
seven
months
he
added
proudly
i
ai
been
outside
this
here
county
where
i
was
born
and
i
can
use
my
eyes
i
can
i
know
a
thing
i
do
when
i
see
it
maybe
it
was
providence
as
you
might
say
what
brought
you
to
the
quite
possibly
dillon
admitted
he
was
just
such
another
as
you
continued
the
old
man
with
apparent
irrelevance
you
do
happen
to
be
stopping
at
hainingham
vicarage
no
replied
dillon
ah
he
was
stopping
at
hainingham
vicarage
and
he
been
wounded
in
france
how
he
got
to
know
kassimere
i
ca
tell
you
not
at
parson
anyway
parson
wo
never
speak
to
him
only
last
sunday
week
he
preached
agin
him
not
in
so
many
words
but
i
could
see
his
drift
he
spoke
about
them
heathen
women
livin
on
an
island
sort
of
female
robinson
crusoes
i
make
out
i
do
as
saves
poor
shipwrecked
sailors
from
the
sea
and
strangles
of
ashore
dillon
glanced
hard
at
the
voluble
old
man
the
sirens
he
suggested
conscious
of
a
sudden
hot
surging
about
his
heart
ah
that
the
women
i
mean
but
where
is
the
connection
ah
you
new
to
these
parts
you
are
that
kassimere
he
keeps
a
siren
down
in
hollow
grange
they
see
her
these
here
strangers
same
as
the
shipwrecked
sailors
parson
told
about
and
it
all
up
with
dillon
stifled
a
laugh
in
which
anger
would
have
mingled
with
contempt
to
think
that
in
the
twentieth
century
a
man
of
science
was
like
to
meet
with
the
fate
of
dee
in
the
days
of
elizabeth
truly
there
were
dark
spots
in
england
but
could
he
credit
the
statement
of
this
benighted
elder
that
a
modern
clergyman
had
actually
drawn
an
analogy
between
phryné
devant
and
the
sirens
it
was
unbelievable
what
was
the
unhappy
fate
he
asked
masking
his
intolerance
of
the
young
man
staying
at
the
vicarage
the
same
as
them
afore
him
came
the
startling
reply
for
he
the
first
and
maybe
with
a
shrewd
glance
of
the
rheumy
old
eyes
he
wo
be
the
last
them
sirens
has
the
powers
of
darkness
i
know
i
seen
one
her
at
the
grange
and
though
i
an
old
man
nigh
on
i
never
forget
her
face
i
wo
and
the
way
she
smiled
at
me
but
persisted
dillon
patiently
what
became
of
this
particular
young
man
the
one
who
was
staying
at
the
vicarage
the
ancient
sage
leant
forward
in
his
chair
and
tapped
the
speaker
upon
the
knee
with
the
stem
of
his
clay
pipe
ask
them
as
knows
he
said
with
impressive
solemnity
nobody
else
can
tell
you
and
having
permitted
an
indiscreet
laugh
to
escape
him
not
another
word
on
the
subject
could
dillon
induce
the
old
man
to
utter
he
strictly
confining
himself
in
his
ruffled
dignity
to
the
climatic
conditions
and
the
crops
when
dillon
finally
set
out
upon
the
walk
back
to
the
grange
he
realised
with
annoyance
that
the
senile
imaginings
of
his
acquaintance
lingered
in
his
mind
that
kassimere
dwelt
outside
the
social
life
of
the
county
he
had
speedily
learnt
but
for
this
he
had
been
prepared
that
he
might
possibly
be
not
a
recluse
but
a
pariah
was
a
new
point
of
view
trivial
things
to
which
hitherto
he
had
paid
scant
attention
began
to
marshal
themselves
as
evidence
the
two
village
helpers
he
knew
received
extravagant
wages
because
as
phryné
had
confessed
they
had
found
it
almost
impossible
to
get
girls
to
stay
why
of
the
earlier
guest
or
guests
who
had
succumbed
to
the
siren
lure
of
phryné
he
had
heard
no
mention
why
save
at
he
rarely
saw
his
host
who
frankly
left
him
to
the
society
of
phryné
again
why
kassimere
in
his
jealously
locked
laboratory
was
at
work
day
and
night
upon
his
experiments
what
were
these
experiments
what
was
the
nature
of
the
doctor
studies
he
had
now
been
for
nearly
three
weeks
at
hollow
grange
and
never
had
kassimere
spoken
of
his
work
and
phryné
the
sudden
new
thought
of
phryné
was
so
strange
so
wonderful
and
overwhelming
that
it
reacted
physically
and
he
pulled
up
short
in
the
middle
of
a
as
though
some
palpable
obstacle
blocked
the
way
why
had
he
set
out
alone
that
day
when
all
other
days
had
been
spent
in
the
girl
company
he
had
deliberately
sought
solitude
because
of
phryné
because
he
wanted
to
think
calmly
judicially
to
arraign
himself
before
his
own
judgment
remote
from
the
witchery
of
her
presence
he
had
tried
to
render
his
mind
a
void
wherein
should
linger
not
one
fragrant
memory
of
her
delicate
beauty
and
charm
so
that
he
might
return
unbiased
to
his
judgment
he
had
returned
he
was
judged
he
loved
phryné
madly
insanely
his
future
his
life
lay
in
the
hollow
of
her
hands
iv
yes
admitted
phryné
it
is
true
there
were
two
of
them
and
dillon
hesitated
were
they
in
love
with
you
of
course
said
phryné
naïvely
but
you
phryné
shook
her
curly
head
i
rather
liked
the
french
boy
but
i
do
not
believe
anything
that
a
frenchman
says
to
a
girl
and
harry
the
other
was
handsome
but
so
silly
so
you
did
not
love
either
of
them
of
course
not
but
said
dillon
and
impulsively
he
swept
her
into
his
arms
you
are
going
to
love
me
one
quick
upward
glance
she
gave
but
instantly
lowered
her
eyes
and
withheld
her
bewitching
face
from
him
am
i
she
whispered
you
are
so
conceited
but
as
she
spoke
the
words
he
kissed
her
and
she
surrendered
sweetly
nestling
her
head
against
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
then
leaping
back
and
blushing
she
turned
and
ran
like
a
startled
fawn
across
the
terrace
and
into
the
house
he
saw
no
more
of
her
until
and
spent
the
interval
in
a
kind
of
suspended
consciousness
that
was
new
and
perturbing
within
him
life
pulsed
at
delirious
speed
but
the
universe
seemed
to
have
slowed
upon
its
course
so
that
each
hour
became
as
two
throughout
dinner
phryné
was
deliciously
shy
to
the
point
of
embarrassment
and
dillon
who
several
times
surprised
the
of
kassimere
studying
the
girl
face
detained
his
host
and
being
a
young
man
of
orderly
mind
formally
asked
his
consent
to
an
engagement
the
doctor
joy
was
seemingly
so
unfeigned
that
dillon
almost
liked
him
for
a
moment
he
placed
no
obstacle
in
the
path
of
the
suitor
for
his
adopted
daughter
hand
graciously
expressing
every
confidence
in
the
future
his
joy
was
genuine
enough
dillon
determined
but
from
what
source
did
it
actually
spring
the
eyes
were
exultant
and
all
the
old
mistrust
poured
back
in
a
wave
upon
the
younger
man
was
this
distrust
becoming
an
obsession
why
should
he
eternally
be
seeking
an
ulterior
motive
for
every
act
in
this
man
life
he
went
to
look
for
phryné
and
found
her
in
the
spot
where
he
had
first
seen
her
prone
in
a
nest
of
cushions
she
sprang
up
as
he
entered
the
room
and
glanced
at
him
in
that
new
way
which
set
his
heart
leaping
and
because
of
the
magic
of
her
presence
it
was
not
until
later
when
he
stood
alone
in
his
own
room
that
he
could
order
the
facts
gleaned
from
her
there
was
some
grain
of
truth
in
the
story
of
the
ancient
gossip
at
the
after
all
a
young
french
lieutenant
of
artillery
had
received
an
invitation
to
spend
a
leave
at
hollow
grange
his
gallic
soul
had
been
fired
by
phryné
beauty
and
although
his
advances
had
been
met
with
rebuff
he
had
asked
kassimere
permission
to
pay
his
court
to
the
girl
on
the
same
evening
he
had
departed
hurriedly
and
phryné
had
supposed
since
the
doctor
never
referred
to
him
again
that
he
had
been
sent
about
his
business
then
came
a
strange
letter
which
phryné
had
shown
to
dillon
its
tone
throughout
was
of
passionate
anger
and
one
passage
recurred
again
and
again
to
dillon
mind
i
would
give
my
life
for
you
gladly
it
read
but
my
soul
belongs
to
god
phryné
had
counted
him
demented
and
kassimere
had
agreed
with
her
but
there
was
harry
waynwright
the
nephew
of
the
vicar
of
at
hainingham
an
accidental
meeting
with
phryné
had
led
to
a
courtesy
call
and
the
inevitable
it
had
all
the
seeming
of
a
case
of
and
the
unhappy
youth
grew
seriously
from
pestering
her
daily
he
changed
his
tactics
to
studiously
avoiding
her
until
meeting
her
in
the
village
one
morning
he
greeted
her
with
i
ca
do
it
phryné
tell
him
i
ca
do
it
he
can
rely
upon
my
word
but
going
away
to
try
to
forget
kassimere
had
professed
entire
ignorance
of
the
meaning
of
the
words
a
faint
shadow
had
crossed
phryné
face
as
she
spoke
of
these
matters
but
as
a
result
of
her
extraordinary
beauty
she
was
somewhat
callous
where
languishing
admirers
were
concerned
and
she
had
dismissed
the
gloomy
twain
with
a
shrug
of
her
charming
shoulders
mad
she
had
said
it
seems
my
fate
always
to
meet
the
night
silence
had
descended
again
upon
hollow
grange
disturbed
only
by
the
mournful
cry
of
the
owl
and
the
almost
imperceptible
note
of
the
bat
but
to
the
nervous
alertness
of
dillon
a
deep
unrest
seemed
to
stir
within
the
house
yet
an
unrest
not
physical
but
spiritual
it
was
as
the
shadow
of
a
sleepless
watcher
a
shadow
creeping
over
his
soul
what
was
the
explanation
lying
at
the
back
of
it
all
vainly
he
sought
for
a
theory
however
wild
however
improbable
that
should
embrace
all
the
facts
known
to
him
and
serve
either
to
banish
his
black
doubts
or
to
focus
them
upon
one
thing
he
had
determined
there
was
some
thing
or
some
one
in
hollow
grange
that
he
some
centre
from
whence
fear
radiated
phryné
for
one
fleeting
moment
had
revealed
to
him
that
she
too
had
known
this
formless
dread
but
only
latterly
probably
from
lack
of
a
more
definite
date
she
had
spoken
of
this
fear
as
first
visiting
her
at
about
the
time
of
the
frenchman
advent
slowly
he
has
changed
towards
me
she
had
whispered
referring
to
kassimere
he
watches
me
sometimes
in
a
strange
way
oh
he
has
been
so
good
so
very
kind
and
good
but
i
shall
be
glad
when
could
some
part
of
the
mystery
be
explained
away
by
the
increasing
absorption
in
his
studies
which
led
him
to
regard
the
charge
of
a
ward
and
a
wayward
one
at
that
as
unduly
onerous
and
disturbing
might
it
not
fairly
be
supposed
that
ignorant
superstition
and
the
ravings
of
unrequited
passion
accounted
for
the
rest
at
the
nature
of
kassimere
studies
he
could
not
even
guess
the
greater
number
of
the
works
in
the
library
related
to
mysticism
in
one
form
or
another
although
there
was
a
sprinkling
of
exact
science
to
leaven
the
whole
he
can
rely
upon
my
word
waynwright
had
said
regarding
what
or
regarding
whom
had
he
given
his
word
the
cry
of
a
came
as
if
in
answer
the
hoot
of
an
owl
as
if
in
mockery
out
beyond
the
terrace
a
dull
red
light
showed
from
kassimere
laboratory
v
enlightenment
came
about
in
this
fashion
seeking
to
quench
a
feverish
thirst
dillon
discovered
that
no
glass
had
been
left
in
his
room
he
determined
to
fetch
one
from
the
buffet
cupboard
downstairs
softly
in
slippered
feet
he
descended
the
stairs
and
was
crossing
the
hallway
when
he
kicked
something
a
small
book
he
thought
that
lay
there
upon
the
floor
groping
he
found
it
slipped
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
and
entered
the
he
found
a
tumbler
without
difficulty
in
the
dark
noted
the
presence
of
a
heavy
oppressive
odour
and
returned
upstairs
now
he
made
another
discovery
he
had
forgotten
the
nightly
draught
of
medicine
prescribed
by
kassimere
a
new
unopened
phial
stood
upon
the
he
mixed
himself
a
mild
whisky
and
soda
from
the
decanter
and
siphon
which
his
host
hospitality
caused
nightly
to
be
placed
in
his
room
and
then
seized
by
a
sudden
thought
took
out
the
little
book
which
he
had
found
in
the
hall
it
was
a
faded
manuscript
in
monkish
latin
a
copy
of
an
unpublished
work
of
paracelsus
many
passages
had
been
rendered
into
english
and
the
translations
in
kassimere
minute
cramped
writing
were
interposed
between
the
bound
pages
in
these
again
were
interpolated
marginal
notes
some
in
the
shape
of
unintelligible
symbols
others
in
that
of
chemical
formulæ
several
passages
were
marked
in
red
ink
and
having
perused
the
first
of
these
which
he
chanced
upon
a
clammy
moisture
broke
out
upon
his
skin
accompanied
by
so
marked
a
nervous
trembling
that
he
was
forced
to
seat
himself
upon
the
bed
the
secret
of
this
man
ghastly
was
in
his
hands
he
knew
now
what
bargain
kassimere
had
proposed
to
the
frenchman
and
to
the
other
he
knew
why
he
had
adopted
the
lovely
daughter
of
louis
devant
and
he
knew
why
he
jack
dillon
had
been
invited
to
hollow
grange
that
such
a
ghoul
in
human
shape
could
live
and
have
his
being
amid
ordinary
mankind
was
a
stupendous
improbability
which
ten
minutes
earlier
he
would
have
laughed
to
scorn
my
god
he
whispered
my
god
his
glance
fell
upon
the
unopened
phial
on
his
and
from
his
soul
a
silent
thanksgiving
rose
to
heaven
that
he
had
left
that
potion
untasted
he
realised
that
his
own
case
differed
from
those
of
his
predecessors
in
two
particulars
he
was
actually
in
residence
under
kassimere
roof
and
receiving
treatment
from
the
man
hands
no
option
was
to
be
offered
to
the
great
experiment
the
was
to
be
performed
without
his
consent
and
phryné
phryné
the
other
innocent
victim
of
this
fiend
lust
for
knowledge
the
thought
restored
his
courage
more
than
life
itself
depended
upon
his
coolness
and
address
he
must
act
at
once
the
monstrous
possibility
hinted
at
by
von
hohenheim
in
his
earliest
published
work
theophrasti
printed
at
augsburg
in
was
in
this
hideous
pamphlet
elaborated
and
brought
within
the
bounds
of
practical
experiment
he
crept
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
listening
intently
that
silence
which
seemed
like
a
palpable
cloud
a
cloud
masking
the
presence
of
one
who
watched
lay
over
the
house
slowly
he
descended
to
the
hall
and
dropped
the
horror
which
the
evil
genius
of
von
hohenheim
had
conceived
upon
the
spot
where
it
had
lain
when
his
foot
had
discovered
it
a
creaking
sound
warned
him
of
some
one
approach
and
he
had
barely
time
to
slip
behind
some
draperies
ere
a
cowled
figure
bearing
a
lantern
came
out
into
the
hall
it
was
kassimere
wearing
a
loose
gown
having
a
monkish
hood
and
he
was
searching
for
something
nothing
in
his
experience
not
the
seen
in
the
eyes
of
men
in
battle
had
prepared
him
for
that
which
transfigured
the
face
of
kassimere
the
strange
semblance
of
thoth
was
there
no
more
it
had
given
place
to
another
more
active
malevolence
to
a
sort
of
satanic
indescribably
terrifying
it
was
the
face
of
one
possessed
like
some
bird
of
prey
he
pounced
upon
the
book
thrust
it
into
the
pocket
of
his
gown
and
began
furtively
to
retrace
his
steps
as
he
entered
the
big
dillon
was
close
upon
his
heels
kassimere
passed
into
the
small
room
beyond
and
turned
from
thence
into
the
library
dillon
observing
every
precaution
followed
from
the
library
the
doctor
entered
the
short
narrow
passage
leading
to
that
quaint
relic
of
bygone
days
and
ways
the
tiny
chapel
at
the
entrance
dillon
paused
watchful
once
the
man
in
the
monkish
robe
turned
on
the
step
of
the
altar
and
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
revealing
a
face
that
might
well
have
been
that
of
asmodeus
himself
on
the
left
of
the
altar
was
the
cupboard
wherein
no
doubt
in
past
ages
the
priest
had
kept
his
vestments
the
oppressive
odour
which
dillon
had
first
observed
in
the
was
very
perceptible
in
the
chapel
and
as
kassimere
opened
the
door
of
the
cupboard
and
stepped
within
an
explanation
of
the
presence
of
this
deathly
smell
in
the
house
occurred
to
dillon
mind
the
laboratory
adjoined
the
grange
on
this
side
here
was
a
private
entrance
known
to
and
used
by
kassimere
alone
his
surmise
proved
to
be
correct
occasioning
scarcely
a
sound
the
secret
door
opened
and
a
fiery
glow
leapt
out
across
the
altar
steps
accompanied
by
a
wave
of
heated
air
laden
with
the
nauseous
unnameable
smell
within
the
redly
lighted
doorway
kassimere
paused
and
glanced
at
a
watch
which
he
wore
upon
his
wrist
then
for
a
moment
he
disappeared
to
reappear
carrying
a
small
squat
bottle
and
a
contrivance
of
wire
and
gauze
the
sight
of
which
created
in
dillon
a
sense
of
physical
nausea
it
was
a
both
he
placed
upon
a
vaguely
seen
table
and
again
approached
the
door
weakly
dillon
fell
back
pressing
himself
closely
against
the
chapel
wall
as
the
doctor
this
time
leaving
the
secret
entrance
open
with
a
purpose
in
view
which
the
watcher
shudderingly
recognized
recrossed
the
chapel
and
went
off
softly
treading
in
the
direction
of
the
library
all
his
courage
moral
and
physical
was
called
upon
now
and
knowing
by
some
intuition
of
love
what
and
whom
he
should
find
there
he
stepped
unsteadily
into
kassimere
laboratory
that
there
were
horrors
monstrosities
that
may
not
be
described
whose
names
may
not
be
written
in
the
place
he
realised
in
some
subconscious
fashion
but
prone
upon
a
low
metal
couch
of
most
curious
workmanship
lay
phryné
in
her
still
white
perfect
in
her
pale
beauty
as
her
namesake
who
posed
for
praxiteles
dillon
reeled
steadied
himself
and
sank
upon
his
knees
by
the
couch

whispered
locking
his
arms
about
her
my
phryné
then
he
remembered
the
gauze
mask
and
even
detected
the
sickly
sweet
smell
of
the
anaesthetic
anger
gave
him
new
strength
he
raised
the
girl
in
his
arms
and
turned
towards
the
door
communicating
with
the
chapel
framed
in
the
opening
was
the
hooded
figure
of
kassimere
confronting
him
his
face
was
immobile
again
with
the
immobility
of
thoth
his
eyes
were
hard
his
voice
was
cold
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
outrage
he
demanded
sternly

careful
you

shrieked
kassimere
frenziedly
his
calm
dropping
from
him
like
a
cloak
and
a
new
and
dreadful
light
coming
into
the
staring
eyes
but
he
was
too
late
dillon
foot
had
caught
the
pedestal
with
a
resounding
crash
the
thing
overturned
as
kassimere
sprang
forward
he
slipped
in
the
slimy
stream
that
was
pouring
over
the
laboratory
floor
and
fell
laying
phryné

the

head
resting

of

upon
the

shrieking
blaspheming
and
fighting
fighting
madly
as
a
man
fights
for
life
and
more
than

he
had
not
yet
carried
the
unconscious
girl
beyond

above
that
other
smell
he
detected
the
odour

fire

broken

memory
of
a
demoniac

introductory
saville
grainger
will
long
be
remembered
by
the
public
as
a
brilliant
journalist
and
by
his
friends
as
a
confirmed
misogynist
his
distaste
for
the
society
of
women
amounted
to
a
mania
and
to
grainger
a
pretty
face
was
like
a
red
rag
to
a
bull
this
was
all
the
more
extraordinary
and
for
grainger
more
painful
because
he
was
one
of
the
most
handsome
men
i
ever
knew
very
dark
with
wonderful
flashing
eyes
and
the
features
of
an
early
roman
or
as
i
have
since
thought
of
an
aristocratic
oriental
aquiline
and
swarthy
at
any
mixed
gathering
at
which
he
appeared
women
gravitated
in
his
direction
as
though
he
possessed
some
magnetic
attraction
for
the
sex
and
grainger
invariably
bolted
his
extraordinary
end
never
explained
to
this
day
will
be
remembered
by
some
of
those
who
read
of
it
but
so
much
that
affected
whole
continents
has
occurred
in
the
interval
that
to
the
majority
of
the
public
the
circumstances
will
no
longer
be
familiar
it
created
a
considerable
stir
in
cairo
at
the
time
as
was
only
natural
but
when
the
missing
man
failed
to
return
the
nine
days
wonder
of
his
disappearance
was
forgotten
in
the
excitement
of
some
new
story
or
another
briefly
grainger
who
was
recuperating
at
mena
house
after
a
rather
severe
illness
in
london
went
out
one
evening
for
a
stroll
wearing
a
light
over
his
evening
clothes
and
smoking
a
cigarette
he
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
great
pyramid
and
never
came
back
that
is
the
story
in
its
bald
entirety
no
one
has
ever
seen
him
since
or
ever
reported
having
seen
him
if
the
following
story
is
an
elaborate
hoax
perpetrated
by
grainger
himself
for
some
obscure
reason
remaining
in
hiding
or
by
another
well
acquainted
with
his
handwriting
i
do
not
profess
to
say
as
to
how
it
came
into
my
possession
that
may
be
told
very
briefly
two
years
after
grainger
disappearance
i
was
in
cairo
and
although
i
was
not
staying
at
mena
house
i
sometimes
visited
friends
there
one
night
as
i
came
out
of
the
hotel
to
enter
the
car
which
was
to
drive
me
back
to
the
continental
a
tall
native
dressed
in
white
and
so
muffled
up
that
little
more
of
his
face
than
two
gleaming
eyes
was
visible
handed
me
a
packet
a
roll
of
paper
apparently
saluted
me
with
extraordinary
formality
and
departed
no
one
else
seemed
to
have
noticed
the
man
although
the
chauffeur
of
course
was
nearly
as
close
to
him
as
i
was
and
a
servant
from
the
hotel
had
followed
me
out
and
down
the
steps
i
stood
there
in
the
dusk
staring
at
the
packet
in
my
hand
and
then
after
the
tall
figure
already
swallowed
up
in
the
shadow
of
the
road
naturally
i
assumed
that
the
man
had
made
some
mistake
and
holding
the
package
near
the
lamp
of
the
car
i
examined
it
closely
it
was
a
roll
of
some
kind
of
parchment
tied
with
a
fragment
of
thin
string
and
upon
the
otherwise
blank
outside
page
my
name
was
written
very
distinctly
i
entered
the
car
rather
dazed
by
the
occurrence
which
presented
several
extraordinary
features
and
unfastening
the
string
began
to
read
then
in
real
earnest
i
thought
i
must
be
dreaming
since
i
append
the
whole
of
the
manuscript
i
will
make
no
further
reference
to
the
contents
here
but
will
content
myself
with
mentioning
that
it
was
written
with
ink
in
saville
grainger
unmistakable
hand
upon
some
kind
of
parchment
or
papyrus
which
has
defied
three
different
experts
to
whom
i
have
shown
it
but
which
in
short
is
of
unknown
manufacture
the
twine
with
which
it
was
tied
proved
to
be
of
finely
plaited
reed
that
part
of
grainger
narrative
if
the
following
amazing
statement
is
really
the
work
of
grainger
which
deals
with
events
up
to
the
time
that
he
left
mena
house
and
the
world
i
have
been
able
to
check
the
dragoman
hassan
was
still
practising
his
profession
at
mena
house
at
the
time
of
my
visit
and
he
confirmed
the
truth
of
grainger
story
in
regard
to
the
heart
of
which
he
had
seen
and
the
meeting
with
the
old
woman
in
the
mûski
of
which
grainger
had
spoken
to
him
for
the
rest
the
manuscript
shall
tell
grainger
story
the
manuscript
i
two
years
have
elapsed
since
i
quitted
the
world
and
the
presence
in
egypt
of
a
colleague
of
which
i
have
been
advised
prompts
me
to
put
on
record
these
particulars
of
the
strangest
most
wonderful
and
most
beautiful
experience
which
has
ever
befallen
any
man
i
do
not
expect
my
story
to
be
believed
the
scepticism
of
the
material
world
of
fleet
street
will
consume
my
statement
with
its
devouring
fires
but
i
do
not
care
the
old
itching
to
make
a
story
is
upon
me
as
a
story
let
this
paper
be
regarded
where
the
experience
actually
began
i
must
leave
to
each
reader
to
judge
for
himself
i
personally
do
not
profess
to
know
even
now
but
the
curtain
first
arose
upon
that
part
of
the
story
which
it
is
my
present
purpose
to
chronicle
one
afternoon
near
the
corner
of
the
street
of
the
silversmiths
in
cairo
i
was
wandering
in
those
wonderful
narrow
winding
lanes
unaccompanied
for
i
am
by
habit
a
solitary
being
and
despite
my
ignorance
of
the
language
and
customs
of
the
natives
i
awakened
to
the
fact
that
a
link
of
sympathy
of
silent
understanding
seemed
to
bind
me
to
these
busy
brown
men
i
had
for
many
years
cherished
a
secret
ambition
to
pay
a
protracted
visit
to
egypt
but
the
ties
of
an
arduous
profession
hitherto
had
rendered
its
realisation
impossible
now
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
i
found
myself
i
can
not
hope
to
make
evident
to
my
readers
the
completeness
of
this
recognition
from
shepheard
with
its
throngs
of
cosmopolitan
travellers
and
its
hosts
of
pretty
women
i
had
early
fled
in
dismay
to
the
comparative
quiet
of
mena
house
but
the
only
real
happiness
i
ever
knew
indeed
as
i
soon
began
to
realise
had
ever
known
i
found
among
the
discordant
cries
and
mingled
smells
of
perfume
and
decay
in
the
native
city
the
desert
called
to
me
sweetly
but
it
was
the
people
the
shops
the
shuttered
houses
the
noise
and
the
smells
of
the
eastern
streets
which
gripped
my
heart
delightedly
i
watched
the
passage
of
those
commercial
vehicles
narrow
and
set
high
upon
monstrous
wheels
which
convey
loads
of
indescribable
variety
along
streets
no
wider
than
the
hall
of
a
small
suburban
residence
the
parsees
in
the
khân
khalîl
with
their
carpets
and
shining
the
arab
dealers
fierce
swarthy
tradesmen
from
the
desert
and
the
cairenes
upholding
embroidered
cloths
and
gauzy
to
allure
the
eye
all
these
i
watched
with
a
kind
of
gladness
that
was
almost
tender
that
was
unlike
any
sentiment
i
had
ever
experienced
toward
my
before
mendicants
crying
the
eternal
with
their
skins
of
nile
water
and
the
other
hundred
and
one
familiar
figures
of
the
quarter
filled
me
with
a
great
and
glad
contentment
i
purposely
haunted
the
mûski
during
the
heat
of
the
day
because
at
that
hour
it
was
comparatively
free
from
the
presence
of
europeans
and
americans
thus
on
the
occasion
of
which
i
write
coming
to
the
end
of
the
street
in
which
the
shops
of
the
principal
silversmiths
are
situated
i
found
myself
to
be
the
only
white
man
if
i
except
the
greeks
in
the
immediate
neighbourhood
a
group
of
men
hurrying
out
of
the
street
as
i
approached
it
first
attracted
my
attention
they
were
glancing
behind
them
apprehensively
as
though
at
a
rabid
dog
then
came
a
man
riding
a
tiny
donkey
and
also
glancing
back
apprehensively
over
his
shoulder
he
all
but
collided
with
me
in
his
blind
haste
and
stepping
quickly
aside
to
avoid
him
i
knocked
down
an
old
woman
who
was
coming
out
of
the
street
the
man
who
had
been
the
real
cause
of
the
accident
rode
off
at
headlong
speed
and
i
found
myself
left
with
the
poor
victim
of
my
clumsiness
in
a
spot
which
seemed
miraculously
to
have
become
deserted
if
the
shopkeepers
remained
in
their
shops
they
were
invisible
and
must
have
retreated
into
the
darkest
corners
of
the
caves
in
the
wall
which
constitute
native
emporiums
pedestrians
there
were
none
i
stooped
to
the
old
woman
who
lay
moaning
at
my
feet
and
as
i
did
so
i
shrank
how
can
i
describe
the
loathing
the
repulsion
which
i
experienced
never
in
the
whole
of
my
career
had
i
seen
such
a
hideous
face
a
ragged
black
veil
which
she
wore
had
been
torn
from
its
brass
fastenings
as
she
fell
and
her
countenance
was
revealed
in
all
its
appalling
ugliness
yellow
shrivelled
toothless
it
was
scarcely
human
but
above
all
it
repelled
because
of
its
aspect
of
i
do
not
mean
that
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
woman
of
eighty
it
was
like
that
of
a
woman
who
had
miraculously
survived
decease
for
several
centuries
it
was
a
a
deathly
face
and
as
i
shrank
she
opened
her
eyes
moaning
feebly
and
groping
with
hands
as
if
darkness
surrounded
her
furthermore
i
saw
a
new
pain
and
a
keener
pain
light
up
those
aged
eyes
she
had
detected
my
involuntary
movement
of
loathing
those
who
knew
me
will
bear
testimony
to
the
fact
that
i
was
not
an
emotional
man
or
one
readily
impressionable
by
any
kind
of
human
appeal
therefore
they
will
wonder
the
more
to
learn
that
this
pathetic
light
in
the
old
woman
eyes
changed
my
revulsion
to
a
poignant
sorrow
i
had
roughly
knocked
her
from
her
feet
and
now
hesitated
to
assist
her
to
rise
again
truly
she
was
scorned
and
rejected
by
all
a
wave
of
tenderness
that
can
not
be
described
that
could
not
be
resisted
swept
over
me
my
eyes
grew
misty
and
a
great
remorse
claimed
me
poor
old
soul
i
whispered
stooping
i
gently
raised
the
shrivelled
head
resting
it
against
my
knee
and
bending
down
i
kissed
the
old
woman
on
the
brow
i
record
the
fact
but
even
now
looking
back
upon
its
happening
and
seeking
to
recapture
the
cold
solitary
saville
grainger
who
has
left
the
world
i
realise
the
wonder
of
it
that
should
have
given
rein
to
such
an
impulse
that
such
an
impulse
should
have
stirred
me
which
phenomenon
was
the
more
remarkable
the
result
of
my
act
regretted
as
soon
as
performed
was
singular
the
aged
hideous
creature
sighed
in
a
manner
i
can
never
forget
and
an
expression
that
almost
lent
comeliness
to
her
features
momentarily
crept
over
her
face
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
difficulty
raised
her
hands
as
if
blessing
me
and
muttering
something
in
arabic
went
shuffling
along
the
deserted
street
stooping
as
she
walked
apparently
the
episode
had
passed
unnoticed
certainly
if
anyone
witnessed
it
he
was
well
concealed
but
conscious
of
a
strange
embarrassment
with
which
were
mingled
other
tumultuous
emotions
i
turned
out
of
the
street
of
the
silversmiths
and
found
myself
amid
the
normal
activities
of
the
quarter
again
the
memory
of
the
kiss
was
repugnant
i
wanted
to
wipe
my
lips
but
something
seemed
to
forbid
the
act
a
lingering
compassion
that
was
almost
a
yearning
for
once
in
my
life
i
desired
to
find
myself
among
normal
healthy
moderately
brainless
europeans
i
longed
for
the
smell
of
for
the
rattle
of
the
and
the
sight
of
a
pretty
face
i
hurried
to
shepheard
ii
the
same
night
after
dinner
i
walked
out
of
mena
house
to
look
for
hassan
the
dragoman
with
whom
i
had
contracted
for
a
journey
by
camel
to
sakhâra
on
the
following
day
he
had
promised
to
attend
at
eight
in
order
to
arrange
the
time
of
starting
in
the
morning
together
with
some
other
details
i
failed
to
find
him
however
among
the
dragomans
and
other
natives
seated
outside
the
hotel
and
to
kill
time
i
strolled
leisurely
down
the
road
toward
the
terminus
i
had
taken
no
more
than
ten
paces
i
suppose
when
a
tall
native
muffled
to
the
tip
of
his
nose
in
white
and
wearing
a
white
turban
appeared
out
of
the
darkness
beside
me
thrust
a
small
package
into
my
hand
and
touching
his
brow
his
lips
and
his
breast
with
both
hands
bowed
and
departed
i
saw
him
no
more
standing
there
in
the
road
i
stared
at
the
little
package
stupidly
it
consisted
of
a
piece
of
fine
white
silk
fastened
about
some
small
hard
object
evidently
i
thought
there
had
been
a
mistake
the
package
could
not
have
been
intended
for
me
returning
to
the
hotel
i
stood
near
a
lamp
and
unfastened
the
silk
which
was
delicately
perfumed
it
contained
a
piece
of
carved
in
the
form
of
a
heart
beautifully
mounted
in
gold
and
bearing
three
arabic
letters
inlaid
in
some
way
also
in
gold
at
this
singular
ornament
i
stared
harder
than
ever
certainly
the
muffled
native
had
made
a
strange
mistake
this
was
a
and
emphatically
not
for
i
was
standing
there
lost
in
wonderment
the
heart
of
in
my
palm
when
the
voice
of
hassan
disturbed
my
stupor
ah
my
gentleman
i
am
sorry
to
be
late
but
the
voice
ceased
i
looked
up
well
i
said
then
i
too
said
no
more
hassan
was
glaring
at
the
ornament
in
my
hand
as
though
i
had
held
not
a
very
choice
example
of
native
jewellery
but
an
adder
or
a
scorpion
what
the
matter
i
asked
recovering
from
my
surprise
do
you
know
to
whom
this
amulet
belongs
he
muttered
something
in
guttural
arabic
ere
replying
to
my
question
then
it
is
the
heart
of
lapis
he
said
in
a
strange
voice
it
is
the
heart
of
lapis
so
much
is
evident
i
cried
laughing
but
does
it
alarm
you
please
he
said
softly
and
held
out
a
brown
hand
i
will
see
i
placed
the
thing
in
his
open
palm
and
he
gazed
at
it
as
one
might
imagine
an
orchid
hunter
would
gaze
at
a
new
species
of
what
do
the
figures
mean
i
asked
they
form
the
word
he
replied
somebody
name
i
said
still
laughing
in
arab
it
mean
ten
hundred
he
whispered
a
thousand
yes
one
thousand
well
hassan
returned
the
ornament
to
me
and
his
expression
was
so
strange
that
i
began
to
grow
really
annoyed
he
was
looking
at
me
with
a
mingling
of
envy
and
compassion
which
i
found
to
be
quite
insufferable
hassan
i
said
sternly
you
will
tell
me
all
you
know
about
this
matter
one
would
imagine
that
you
suspected
me
of
stealing
the
thing
ah
no
my
gentleman
he
protested
earnestly
but
i
will
tell
you
yes
only
you
will
not
believe
me
never
mind
tell
me
thereupon
hassan
told
me
the
most
improbable
story
to
which
i
had
ever
listened
since
to
reproduce
it
in
his
imperfect
english
with
my
own
frequent
interjections
would
be
tedious
i
will
give
it
in
brief
some
of
the
historical
details
imperfectly
related
by
hassan
as
i
learned
later
i
have
corrected
in
the
reign
of
the
khalîf
a
son
of
hárûn
and
brother
of
the
prototype
of
beckford
one
shâwar
was
governor
of
egypt
and
the
daughter
of
the
governor
scheherazade
was
famed
throughout
the
domains
of
the
khalîf
as
the
most
beautiful
maiden
in
the
land
wazîrs
and
princes
sought
her
hand
in
vain
her
heart
was
given
to
a
handsome
young
merchant
of
cairo
ahmad
who
was
also
the
wealthiest
man
in
the
city
shâwar
although
an
indulgent
father
would
not
hear
of
such
a
union
however
but
he
hesitated
to
destroy
his
daughter
happiness
by
forcing
her
into
an
unwelcome
marriage
finally
passion
conquered
reason
in
the
breasts
of
the
lovers
and
they
fled
scheherazade
escaping
from
the
palace
of
her
father
by
means
of
a
smuggled
into
the
apartments
by
a
slave
whom
gold
had
tempted
and
meeting
ahmad
outside
the
gardens
where
he
waited
with
a
fleet
horse
even
the
guard
at
the
city
gate
had
been
bought
by
the
wealthy
merchant
and
the
pair
succeeded
in
escaping
from
cairo
the
extensive
possessions
of
ahmad
were
confiscated
by
the
enraged
father
and
a
sentence
of
death
was
passed
upon
the
absent
man
to
be
instantly
put
into
execution
in
the
event
of
his
arrest
anywhere
within
the
domain
of
the
khalîf
exiled
in
a
distant
oasis
the
sheikh
of
which
was
bound
to
ahmad
by
ties
of
ancient
friendship
the
prospect
which
had
seemed
so
alluring
to
scheherazade
became
clouded
recognising
this
change
in
her
attitude
ahmad
racked
his
brains
for
some
scheme
whereby
he
might
recover
his
lost
wealth
and
surround
his
beautiful
wife
with
the
luxury
to
which
she
had
been
accustomed
in
this
extremity
he
had
recourse
to
a
certain
recluse
who
resided
in
a
solitary
spot
in
the
desert
far
from
the
haunts
of
men
and
who
was
widely
credited
with
magical
powers
it
was
a
whole
week
journey
to
the
abode
of
the
wizard
and
unknown
to
ahmad
during
his
absence
a
son
of
the
khalîf
visiting
egypt
chanced
to
lose
his
way
on
a
hunting
expedition
and
came
upon
the
secret
oasis
in
which
scheherazade
was
hiding
this
prince
had
been
one
of
her
most
persistent
suitors
the
ancient
magician
consented
to
receive
ahmad
and
the
first
boon
which
the
enamoured
young
man
craved
of
him
was
that
he
might
grant
him
a
sight
of
scheherazade
the
student
of
dark
arts
consented
bidding
ahmad
to
look
into
a
mirror
he
burned
the
secret
perfumes
and
uttered
the
prescribed
incantation
at
first
mistily
and
then
quite
clearly
ahmad
saw
scheherazade
standing
in
the
moonlight
beneath
a
tall
palm
tree
her
lips
raised
to
those
of
her
former
suitor
at
that
the
world
grew
black
before
the
eyes
of
ahmad
and
he
who
had
come
a
long
and
arduous
journey
at
the
behest
of
love
now
experienced
an
equally
passionate
hatred
acquainting
the
magician
with
what
he
had
seen
he
demanded
that
he
should
exercise
his
art
in
visiting
upon
the
false
scheherazade
the
most
terrible
curse
that
it
lay
within
his
power
to
invoke
the
learned
man
refused
whereupon
ahmad
insane
with
sorrow
and
anger
drew
his
sword
and
gave
the
magician
choice
of
compliance
or
instant
death
the
threat
sufficed
the
wizard
performed
a
ghastly
conjuration
calling
down
upon
scheherazade
the
curse
of
an
ugliness
beyond
that
of
humanity
and
which
should
remain
with
her
not
for
the
ordinary
span
of
a
lifetime
but
for
incalculable
years
during
which
she
should
continue
to
live
in
the
flesh
loathed
despised
and
shunned
of
all
until
one
thousand
compassionate
men
unasked
and
of
their
own
free
will
shall
each
have
bestowed
a
kiss
upon
thee
was
the
exact
text
of
the
curse
then
thou
shalt
regain
thy
beauty
thy
love
and
death
ahmad
staggered
out
from
the
cavern
blinded
by
a
hundred
emotions
already
sick
with
remorse
and
one
night
stage
on
his
return
journey
dropped
dead
from
his
saddle
stricken
by
the
malignant
will
of
the
awful
being
whose
power
he
had
invoked
i
will
conclude
this
wild
romance
in
the
words
of
hassan
the
dragoman
as
nearly
as
i
can
recall
them
and
so
he
said
his
voice
lowered
in
awe
scheherazade
who
was
stricken
with
age
and
ugliness
in
the
very
hour
that
the
curse
was
spoken
went
out
into
the
world
my
gentleman
she
begged
her
way
from
place
to
place
and
as
the
years
passed
by
accumulated
much
wealth
in
that
manner
finally
it
is
said
she
returned
to
cairo
her
native
city
and
there
remained
to
each
man
who
bestowed
a
kiss
upon
her
and
such
men
were
rare
she
caused
a
heart
of
lapis
to
be
sent
and
upon
the
heart
was
engraved
in
gold
the
number
of
the
kiss
it
is
said
that
these
gifts
ensured
to
those
upon
whom
they
were
bestowed
the
certain
possession
of
their
beloved
once
before
when
i
was
a
small
child
i
saw
such
an
amulet
and
the
number
upon
it
was
nine
hundred
and
the
thing
was
utterly
incredible
of
course
merely
a
picturesque
example
of
eastern
imagination
but
just
to
see
what
effect
it
would
have
upon
him
i
told
hassan
about
the
old
woman
in
the
mûski
i
had
to
do
so
frankly
the
coincidence
was
so
extraordinary
that
it
worried
me
when
i
had
finished
it
was
she
scheherazade
he
said
fearfully
and
it
was
the
kiss
what
then
i
asked
nothing
my
gentleman
i
do
not
know
iii
throughout
the
expedition
to
sakhâra
on
the
following
day
i
could
not
fail
to
note
that
hassan
was
covertly
watching
me
and
his
expression
annoyed
me
intensely
it
was
that
compound
of
compassion
and
resignation
which
one
might
bestow
upon
a
condemned
man
i
charged
him
with
it
but
of
course
he
denied
any
such
sentiment
nevertheless
i
knew
that
he
entertained
it
and
what
was
worse
i
began
in
an
uncomfortable
degree
to
share
it
with
him
i
can
not
make
myself
clearer
but
i
simply
felt
the
normal
world
to
be
slipping
from
under
my
feet
and
no
longer
experiencing
a
desire
to
clutch
at
modernity
as
i
had
done
after
my
meeting
with
the
old
woman
i
found
myself
to
be
reconciled
to
my
fate
to
my
fate
to
what
fate
i
did
not
know
but
i
realised
beyond
any
shade
of
doubt
that
something
tremendous
inevitable
and
ultimate
was
about
to
happen
to
me
i
caught
myself
unconsciously
raising
the
heart
of
to
my
lips
why
i
did
so
i
had
no
idea
i
seemed
to
have
lost
identity
i
no
longer
knew
myself
when
hassan
parted
from
me
at
mena
house
that
evening
he
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
he
regarded
the
parting
as
final
yet
my
plans
were
made
for
several
weeks
ahead
nor
did
i
quarrel
with
the
curious
attitude
regarded
the
parting
as
final
also
in
a
word
i
was
becoming
reconciled
to
something
it
is
difficult
all
but
impossible
to
render
such
a
frame
of
mind
comprehensible
and
i
shall
not
even
attempt
the
task
but
leave
the
events
of
the
night
to
speak
for
themselves
after
dinner
i
lighted
a
cigarette
and
avoiding
a
particularly
persistent
and
very
pretty
widow
who
was
waiting
to
waylay
me
in
the
lounge
i
came
out
of
the
hotel
and
strolled
along
in
the
direction
of
the
pyramid
once
i
looked
back
bidding
a
silent
farewell
to
mena
house
then
i
took
out
the
heart
of
from
my
pocket
and
kissed
it
rapturously
kissed
it
as
i
had
never
kissed
any
object
or
any
person
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
and
why
i
did
so
i
had
no
idea
all
who
read
my
story
will
be
prepared
to
learn
that
in
this
placid
and
apparently
feeble
frame
of
mind
i
slipped
from
life
from
the
world
it
was
not
so
the
modern
man
the
saville
grainger
once
known
in
fleet
street
came
to
life
again
for
one
terrible
strenuous
moment
and
then
passed
out
of
life
for
ever
just
before
i
reached
the
pyramid
and
at
a
lonely
spot
in
the
path
for
this
was
not
a
sphinx
and
pyramid
night
that
is
to
say
the
moon
was
not
at
the
full
a
tall
muffled
native
appeared
at
my
elbow
he
was
the
same
man
who
had
brought
me
the
heart
of
or
his
double
i
started
he
touched
me
lightly
on
the
arm
follow
he
said
and
pointed
ahead
into
the
darkness
below
the
plateau
i
moved
off
obediently
then
suddenly
swiftly
came
revolt
the
modern
man
within
me
flared
into
angry
life
i
stopped
dead
and
who
are
you
where
are
you
leading
me
i
cried
i
received
no
reply
a
silk
scarf
was
slipped
over
my
head
by
some
one
who
silently
must
have
been
following
me
and
drawn
tight
enough
to
prevent
any
loud
outcry
but
not
so
as
to
endanger
my
breathing
i
fought
like
a
madman
i
knew
and
the
knowledge
appalled
me
that
i
was
fighting
for
life
arms
like
bands
of
steel
grasped
me
i
was
lifted
bound
and
carried
i
knew
not
where
placed
in
some
kind
of
softly
padded
saddle
or
as
i
have
since
learned
into
a
or
covered
litter
on
a
camel
back
i
felt
the
animal
rise
to
its
ungainly
height
and
move
off
swiftly
as
suddenly
as
revolt
had
flamed
up
resignation
returned
i
was
contented
my
bonds
were
unnecessary
my
rebellion
was
ended
i
yearned
wildly
for
the
end
of
the
desert
journey
some
one
was
calling
me
and
all
my
soul
replied
for
hours
as
it
seemed
the
camel
raced
ceaselessly
on
absolute
silence
reigned
about
me
then
in
the
distance
i
heard
voices
and
the
gait
of
the
camel
changed
finally
the
animal
stood
still
came
a
word
of
guttural
command
and
the
camel
dropped
to
its
knees
pillowed
among
a
pile
of
scented
cushions
i
experienced
no
discomfort
from
this
usually
painful
operation
i
was
lifted
out
of
my
perfumed
couch
and
set
upon
my
feet
having
been
allowed
to
stand
for
a
while
until
the
effects
of
remaining
so
long
in
a
constrained
position
had
worn
off
i
was
led
forward
into
some
extensive
building
marble
pavements
were
beneath
my
feet
fountains
played
and
the
air
was
heavy
with
burning
ambergris
i
was
placed
with
my
back
to
a
pillar
and
bound
there
but
not
harshly
the
bandage
about
my
head
was
removed
i
stared
around
me
a
magnificent
eastern
apartment
met
my
gaze
a
great
hall
open
on
one
side
to
the
desert
out
upon
the
sands
i
could
see
a
group
of
men
who
had
evidently
been
my
captors
and
my
guards
the
one
who
had
unfastened
the
silk
scarf
i
could
not
see
but
i
heard
him
moving
away
behind
the
pillar
to
which
i
was
bound
stretched
upon
a
luxurious
couch
before
me
was
a
woman
if
i
were
to
seek
to
describe
her
i
should
inevitably
fail
for
her
loveliness
surpassed
everything
which
i
had
ever
beheld
of
which
i
had
ever
dreamed
i
found
myself
looking
into
her
eyes
and
in
their
depths
i
found
all
that
i
had
missed
in
life
and
lost
all
that
i
had
found
she
smiled
rose
and
taking
a
jewelled
dagger
from
a
little
table
beside
her
approached
me
my
heart
beat
until
i
felt
almost
suffocated
as
she
came
near
and
when
she
bent
and
cut
the
silken
lashing
which
bound
me
i
knew
such
rapture
as
i
had
hitherto
counted
an
invention
of
arabian
poets
i
was
raised
above
the
joys
of
common
humanity
and
tasted
the
joy
of
the
gods
she
placed
the
dagger
in
my
hand
my
life
is
thine
she
said
take
it
and
clutching
at
the
silken
raiment
draping
her
beautiful
bosom
she
invited
me
to
plunge
the
blade
into
her
heart
the
knife
dropped
clattering
upon
the
marble
pavement
for
one
instant
i
hesitated
watching
her
devouring
her
with
my
eyes
then
i
swept
her
to
me
and
pressed
upon
her
sweet
lips
the
thousand
and
first
kiss
the
manuscript
of
saville
grainger
finishes
here
the
turquoise
necklace
i
he
is
the
lord
of
the
desert
effendi
declared
mohammed
the
dragoman
from
the
valley
of
zered
to
damascus
he
is
known
and
loved
but
feared
they
say
he
lowered
his
voice
that
he
is
a
great
and
that
he
is
often
seen
in
the
street
of
the
attars
having
the
appearance
of
a
simple
old
man
but
in
the
desert
he
is
like
a
bitter
apple
a
viper
and
a
calamity
overlord
is
he
of
the
bedouins
and
all
the
sons
of
the
desert
bow
to
ben
azreem
sheikh
of
the
what
is
a
exactly
asked
graham
a
man
of
god
effendi
favoured
beyond
other
men
and
this
arab
sheikh
is
a
so
it
is
said
he
goes
about
secretly
aiding
the
poor
and
afflicted
when
he
may
be
known
by
his
white
beard
there
are
many
white
beards
in
egypt
said
graham
but
the
other
continued
ignoring
the
interruption
and
in
the
desert
ben
azreem
a
horseman
unrivalled
may
be
known
by
the
horse
which
he
rides
or
if
he
is
not
so
mounted
by
his
white
camel
swifter
than
the
glance
of
envy
more
surefooted
than
the
eager
lover
who
climbs
to
his
enslaver
window
indeed
said
graham
dryly
well
i
hope
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
meeting
this
mysterious
notability
before
i
leave
the
country
unless
you
journey
across
the
sands
for
many
days
it
is
unlikely
for
when
he
comes
into
egypt
he
reveals
himself
to
none
but
the
supremely
good
graham
stared
and
the
supremely
wicked
added
mohammed
the
poetic
dragoman
having
departed
graham
leaned
over
to
his
wife
who
had
sat
spellbound
her
big
blue
eyes
turned
to
the
face
of
mohammed
throughout
his
romantic
narrative
these
wild
native
legends
appeal
to
you
do
they
he
said
smiling
and
patting
her
hand
affectionately
you
superstitious
little
colleen
eileen
graham
blushed
and
the
blush
of
a
pretty
irish
bride
is
a
very
beautiful
thing
do
you
believe
it
at
all
then
she
asked
softly
i
believe
there
may
be
such
a
person
as
ben
azreem
and
possibly
he
a
very
imposing
individual
he
may
even
indulge
in
visits
incognito
to
cairo
in
the
manner
of
the
late
lamented
hárûn
of
memory
but
i
ca
say
that
i
believe
in
as
a
class
his
wife
shrugged
her
pretty
shoulders
there
is
something
that
have
to
tell
you
which
i
suppose
you
will
also
refuse
to
believe
she
said
with
mock
indignation
you
remember
the
arabs
whom
we
saw
at
the
exhibition
in
london
graham
started
the
gentlemen
who
were
advertised
as
from
the
arabian
desert
i
remember
in
particular
that
is
the
one
i
mean
said
eileen
her
husband
looked
at
her
curiously
your
explanation
is
delightfully
lucid
dear
he
said
jocularly
my
memories
of
the
gentleman
known
as
i
believe
are
not
pleasant
his
memories
of
me
must
be
equally
unfavourable
he
illustrated
the
fact
that
savages
should
never
be
introduced
into
civilised
society
however
fascinating
they
may
be
personally
marstham
was
silly
enough
to
take
the
man
up
and
because
of
the
way
he
looked
at
you
i
was
wise
enough
to
knock
him
down
what
then
only
this
i
saw
him
eileen
there
was
alarm
in
graham
voice
where
here
or
in
cairo
as
we
were
driving
away
from
the
mosque
of
the
whirling
dervishes
he
was
one
of
a
group
who
stood
by
the
bridge
you
are
certain
quite
certain
did
he
see
you
i
could
say
he
gave
no
sign
to
show
that
he
had
seen
me
john
graham
lighted
a
cigarette
with
much
care
it
does
matter
anyway
he
said
carelessly
you
are
as
safe
here
as
at
the
but
there
was
unrest
in
the
glance
which
he
cast
out
across
the
prospect
touched
by
into
supernatural
beauty
in
the
distance
gleamed
a
fairy
city
of
silvern
minarets
born
it
seemed
from
the
silvern
stream
beyond
lay
the
night
mystery
of
the
desert
into
whose
vastness
marched
the
ghostly
acacias
the
discordant
chattering
and
chanting
from
the
merged
into
a
humming
song
not
unmusical
the
howling
of
the
dogs
even
found
a
place
in
the
orchestral
scheme
behind
him
in
the
hotel
was
european
and
american
life
modernity
before
him
was
that
other
life
endless
and
unchanging
there
was
something
cold
sombre
and
bleak
in
the
wonderful
prospect
something
shocking
in
the
presence
of
those
careless
folk
the
luxurious
hotel
that
was
western
and
new
upon
that
threshold
of
the
ancient
changeless
desert
a
menace
too
substantial
yet
cloaked
with
the
mystery
of
the
motherland
of
mysteries
had
arisen
now
although
he
had
assured
eileen
that
gizeh
was
as
safe
as
piccadilly
he
had
too
much
imagination
to
be
unaware
that
from
the
egypt
of
cook
to
the
egypt
of
secrets
is
but
a
step
none
but
the
very
young
or
very
sanguine
traveller
looks
for
adventure
nowadays
in
the
neighbourhood
of
mena
house
when
the
intrepid
george
sandys
visited
and
explored
the
great
pyramid
it
was
at
peril
of
his
life
but
graham
reflected
humorously
that
the
most
nervous
old
ladies
now
performed
the
feat
almost
daily
yet
out
here
in
the
moonlight
where
the
silence
was
out
beyond
the
radius
of
sights
lay
a
land
unknown
to
europe
as
every
desert
is
unknown
it
was
a
thought
that
had
often
come
to
him
but
it
came
with
a
force
and
wearing
a
significance
which
changed
the
aspect
of
the
sands
the
aspect
of
all
egypt
he
glanced
at
the
charming
girl
beside
him
eileen
too
was
looking
into
the
distance
with
gaze
the
pose
of
her
head
was
delightful
and
he
sat
watching
her
in
silence
within
the
hotel
the
orchestra
had
commenced
softly
to
play
but
graham
did
not
notice
the
fact
he
was
thinking
how
easily
one
could
be
lost
out
upon
that
grey
ocean
with
its
islands
of
priestly
ruins
it
is
growing
rather
chilly
dear
he
said
suddenly
even
for
fur
wraps
suppose
we
go
in
ii
the
crowd
in
the
bazaar
was
excessive
and
the
bent
old
figure
which
laboured
beneath
a
nondescript
burden
wrapped
up
in
a
blue
cloth
passed
from
the
noisiness
out
into
the
narrow
street
which
ran
at
with
the
lane
of
many
shops
perhaps
the
old
arab
was
deaf
perhaps
wearied
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
but
from
whatever
cause
he
ignored
or
was
unaware
of
the
oncoming
whose
driver
had
lost
control
of
his
horse
even
the
shrill
scream
of
the
corpulent
german
lady
who
was
one
of
its
passengers
failed
to
arouse
him
out
into
the
narrow
roadway
he
staggered
bent
almost
double
graham
accompanied
by
mohammed
was
some
distance
away
haggling
with
a
greek
thief
who
held
the
view
that
a
return
of
three
hundred
and
fifty
per
cent
spelled
black
ruination
eileen
finding
the
air
stifling
had
walked
on
in
the
direction
of
the
less
crowded
street
above
thus
it
happened
that
she
and
the
poor
old
porter
alone
were
in
the
path
of
the
carriage
many
women
so
placed
would
have
stood
frozen
with
horror
have
been
struck
down
by
the
frantic
animal
some
would
have
had
sufficient
presence
of
mind
to
gain
the
only
shelter
attainable
in
time
that
of
a
doorway
few
would
have
acted
as
eileen
acted
it
was
under
the
stimulus
of
that
celtic
impetuosity
that
generous
madness
which
seems
to
proceed
not
from
the
mind
but
from
the
heart
that
she
leapt
not
back
but
forward
she
never
knew
exactly
what
took
place
nor
how
she
escaped
destruction
but
there
was
a
roaring
in
her
ears
above
it
rising
the
teutonic
screams
of
the
lady
in
the
there
was
a
confused
chorus
of
voices
a
consciousness
of
effort
and
she
found
herself
with
wildly
beating
heart
crouching
back
into
the
recess
which
once
had
held
a
from
some
place
invisible
around
a
bend
in
the
tortuous
street
came
sounds
of
shouting
and
that
of
lashing
hoofs
the
runaway
was
stopped
at
her
feet
lay
a
shapeless
bundle
wrapped
in
a
blue
cloth
and
beside
her
leaning
back
against
the
whitewashed
wall
and
breathing
with
short
sobbing
breaths
was
the
old
porter
now
her
husband
had
his
arms
about
her
and
mohammed
with
frightened
eyes
hovered
in
the
background
without
undue
haste
all
the
bazaar
gradually
was
coming
upon
the
scene
my
darling
are
you
hurt
john
graham
voice
shook
he
was
deathly
pale
eileen
smiled
reassuringly
not
a
bit
dear
she
said
breathlessly
but
i
am
afraid
the
poor
old
man
is
you
are
quite
sure
you
are
not
hurt
i
was
not
so
much
as
touched
though
honestly
i
do
know
how
either
of
us
escaped
but
do
see
if
the
old
man
is
injured
graham
turned
to
the
rescued
porter
who
now
had
recovered
his
composure
mohammed
ask
him
if
he
is
hurt
he
directed
mohammed
put
the
question
a
curious
group
surrounded
the
party
but
the
old
man
ignoring
all
knelt
and
bowed
his
bare
head
to
the
dust
at
eileen
feet
oh
john
cried
the
girl
ask
him
to
stand
up
i
feel
ashamed
to
see
such
a
venerable
old
man
kneeling
before
me
tell
him
it
is
nothing
said
graham
hastily
to
mohammed
and
er
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
give
him
this
but
mohammed
looking
ill
at
ease
thrust
aside
the
proffered
a
novel
action
which
made
graham
stare
widely
he
would
not
take
it
effendi
he
whispered
see
his
turban
lies
there
he
is
a
he
is
praying
for
the
eternal
happiness
of
his
preserver
and
he
is
interceding
with
the
prophet
that
she
may
enjoy
the
delights
of
paradise
equally
with
all
true
believers
very
good
of
him
said
graham
who
finding
the
danger
passed
and
his
wife
safe
was
beginning
to
feel
embarrassed
thank
him
and
tell
him
that
she
is
greatly
indebted
he
took
eileen
arm
and
turned
to
force
a
way
through
the
strangely
silent
group
about
but
the
aged
porter
seized
the
hem
of
the
white
skirt
gently
detaining
her
as
he
rose
upon
his
knees
mohammed
with
marks
of
unusual
deference
handed
him
his
green
turban
the
old
man
still
clutching
eileen
dress
signed
that
his
dirty
bundle
should
likewise
be
passed
to
him
this
was
done
graham
was
impatient
to
get
away
but
humour
him
for
a
moment
dear
said
eileen
softly
we
do
want
to
hurt
the
poor
old
fellow
feelings
into
the
bundle
the
old
man
plunged
his
hand
and
drew
out
a
thin
gold
chain
upon
which
hung
a
queerly
cut
turquoise
he
stood
upright
raised
the
piece
of
jewellery
to
his
forehead
and
to
his
lips
and
held
it
out
the
chain
stretched
across
his
open
palms
to
eileen
he
must
be
some
kind
of
pedlar
said
graham
eileen
shook
her
head
smiling
mohammed
tell
him
that
i
can
not
possibly
take
his
chain
she
directed
but
thank
him
all
the
same
of
course
mohammed
his
face
averted
from
the
statuesque
old
figure
bent
to
her
ear
take
it
he
whispered
take
it
do
not
refuse
there
was
a
sort
of
frightened
urgency
in
his
tones
so
that
both
graham
and
his
wife
looked
at
him
curiously
take
it
then
eileen
said
graham
quickly
and
mohammed
you
must
find
out
who
he
is
and
we
will
make
it
up
to
him
in
some
way
yes
yes
effendi
agreed
the
man
readily
eileen
accordingly
accepted
the
present
glancing
aside
at
her
husband
to
intimate
that
they
must
not
fail
to
pay
for
it
as
she
took
the
chain
in
her
hands
the
donor
said
something
in
a
low
voice
hang
it
round
your
neck
translated
mohammed
eileen
did
so
whispering
you
must
not
lose
sight
of
him
mohammed
mohammed
nodded
and
the
old
man
replacing
his
turban
and
making
a
low
obeisance
spoke
rapidly
a
few
words
took
up
his
bundle
and
departed
the
silent
bystanders
made
way
for
him
come
on
said
graham
i
am
anxious
to
get
out
of
this
find
a
carriage
mohammed
we
lunch
at
shepheard
a
carriage
was
obtained
and
they
soon
left
far
behind
them
the
scene
of
this
odd
adventure
with
mohammed
perched
up
on
the
box
graham
and
his
wife
could
discuss
the
episode
without
restraint
graham
however
did
most
of
the
talking
for
eileen
was
strangely
silent
it
is
quite
a
fine
stone
he
said
examining
the
necklace
so
curiously
acquired
we
must
find
some
way
of
repaying
the
old
chap
which
will
not
offend
his
susceptibilities
eileen
nodded
absently
and
her
husband
with
his
eyes
upon
the
dainty
white
figure
found
gratitude
for
her
safety
welling
up
like
a
hot
spring
in
his
heart
the
action
had
been
characteristic
and
he
longed
to
reprove
her
for
risking
her
life
yet
burned
to
take
her
in
his
arms
for
the
noble
impulse
that
had
prompted
her
to
do
so
he
wondered
anxiously
if
her
silence
could
be
due
to
the
of
that
moment
of
intense
excitement
you
do
feel
unwell
darling
he
whispered
she
smiled
at
him
radiantly
and
gave
his
hand
a
quick
little
squeeze
of
course
not
she
said
but
she
remained
silent
to
the
end
of
the
short
drive
this
was
not
due
to
that
which
her
husband
feared
however
but
to
the
fact
that
she
had
caught
a
glimpse
amongst
the
throng
at
the
corner
of
the
bazaar
of
the
handsome
sinister
face
of
the
bedouin
iii
the
moon
poured
radiance
on
the
desert
at
the
entrance
to
a
tent
stood
a
tall
handsome
man
arrayed
in
the
picturesque
costume
of
the
bedouin
the
tent
behind
him
was
upheld
by
six
poles
the
ends
and
one
side
were
pegged
to
the
ground
and
the
whole
of
that
side
before
which
he
stood
was
quite
open
with
the
exception
of
a
portion
before
which
hung
a
curtain
this
was
the
house
of
hair
of
the
sheikh
of
the
the
regicide
outcast
of
the
great
tribe
of
the
bishareen
at
some
distance
from
the
sheikh
tent
were
some
half
a
dozen
other
and
smaller
tents
housing
the
rascally
following
of
this
desert
outcast
little
did
those
who
had
engaged
the
picturesque
to
display
his
marvellous
horsemanship
in
london
know
that
he
and
those
that
came
with
him
were
a
scorn
among
true
sons
of
the
desert
pariahs
of
that
brotherhood
which
extends
from
zered
to
the
nile
from
tanta
to
the
red
sea
little
did
those
who
had
opened
their
doors
in
hospitality
to
the
dashing
horseman
dream
that
they
entertained
a
petty
brigand
sought
for
by
the
egyptian
authorities
driven
out
into
ostracism
by
his
own
people
and
now
before
his
tent
he
stood
statuesque
in
the
egyptian
moonlight
and
looked
towards
gizeh
less
than
thirty
miles
to
the
as
looked
towards
gizeh
graham
and
his
wife
were
seated
before
mena
house
looking
out
across
the
desert
the
adventure
of
the
morning
had
left
its
impression
upon
both
of
them
and
eileen
wore
the
gold
chain
with
its
turquoise
pendant
graham
was
smoking
in
silence
and
thinking
not
of
the
old
porter
and
his
odd
eastern
gratitude
but
of
another
figure
and
one
which
often
came
between
his
mental
eye
and
the
beauties
of
that
old
beautiful
land
eileen
too
was
thinking
of
for
the
bedouin
now
was
associated
in
her
mind
with
the
old
pedlar
since
she
had
last
seen
the
handsome
sinister
face
amid
the
throng
at
the
entrance
to
the
bazaar
telepathy
is
a
curious
fact
were
graham
reflections
with
his
wife
or
were
they
both
influenced
by
the
passionate
thoughts
of
that
other
mind
that
subtle
cunning
mind
of
the
man
who
at
that
moment
was
standing
before
his
house
of
hair
and
seeking
with
his
eagle
glance
to
defy
distance
and
the
night
have
you
seen
him
again
asked
graham
abruptly
since
the
other
day
at
the
bridge
eileen
started
although
he
had
endeavoured
to
hide
it
from
her
she
was
perfectly
well
aware
of
her
husband
intense
anxiety
on
her
behalf
she
knew
although
he
prided
himself
upon
having
masked
his
feelings
that
the
presence
of
the
bedouin
in
egypt
had
cast
a
cloud
upon
his
happiness
therefore
she
had
not
wished
to
tell
him
of
her
second
encounter
with
but
to
this
direct
question
there
could
be
only
one
reply
i
saw
him
again
this
morning
she
said
toying
nervously
with
the
pendant
at
her
neck
graham
clasped
her
hand
tensely
where
outside
the
bazaar
in
the
crowd
you
did
not
tell
me
i
did
not
want
to
worry
you
he
laughed
dryly
it
does
worry
me
eileen
he
said
carelessly
if
i
were
in
damascus
or
aleppo
it
certainly
might
worry
me
to
know
that
a
man
no
doubt
actively
malignant
towards
us
was
near
perhaps
watching
but
cairo
is
really
a
prosaically
safe
and
spot
we
are
as
secure
here
as
we
should
be
at
shepherd
bush
say
he
laughed
shortly
voices
floated
out
to
them
nasal
guttural
strident
voices
american
teutonic
gallic
and
the
orchestra
played
a
viennese
waltz
confused
chattering
creaking
and
bumping
sounded
from
the
river
out
upon
the
mud
walls
dogs
bayed
the
moon
but
beyond
the
native
village
beyond
the
howling
dogs
beyond
the
acacia
ranks
out
in
the
mystery
of
the
sands
hard
by
an
outpost
of
the
pharaohs
where
a
ruined
shrine
of
horus
bared
its
secret
places
to
the
peeping
moon
the
sheikh
of
the
smiled
graham
felt
strangely
uneasy
and
sought
by
light
conversation
to
shake
off
the
gloom
which
threatened
to
claim
him
that
thief
mohammed
he
said
tersely
has
no
more
idea
than
adam
i
believe
who
your
old
porter
friend
really
is
why
do
you
think
so
asked
eileen
because
he
up
in
cairo
searching
for
him
how
do
you
know
i
cornered
him
about
it
this
afternoon
and
although
i
could
force
an
admission
from
him
i
do
think
anybody
short
of
an
accomplished
could
he
was
suspiciously
evasive
i
gave
him
four
hours
to
procure
the
name
and
address
of
the
old
gentleman
to
whom
we
owe
the
price
of
a
turquoise
necklace
he
has
not
turned
up
yet
eileen
made
no
reply
her
celtic
imagination
had
invested
the
incident
with
a
mystic
significance
which
she
could
not
hope
to
impart
to
her
husband
a
dirty
and
ragged
egyptian
boy
made
his
way
on
to
the
verandah
furtively
glancing
about
him
as
if
anticipating
the
cuff
of
an
unseen
hand
he
sidled
up
to
graham
thrusting
a
scrap
of
paper
on
to
the
little
table
beside
him
for
me
said
graham
the
boy
nodded
and
whilst
eileen
watched
him
interestedly
graham
tilting
the
communication
so
as
to
catch
the
light
from
the
hotel
windows
read
the
following
he
is
come
to
here
but
can
not
any
farther
i
have
him
waiting
the
boy
will
bring
you
your
obedient
effendi
mohammed
graham
laughed
grimly
glancing
at
his
watch
only
half
an
hour
late
he
said
standing
up
wait
here
eileen
i
shall
not
be
many
minutes
but
i
should
like
to
see
him
too
he
might
accept
the
price
from
me
where
you
would
fail
to
induce
him
to
take
it
never
fear
said
her
husband
he
would
have
come
if
he
meant
to
refuse
what
shall
i
offer
him
whatever
you
think
said
eileen
smiling
be
generous
with
the
poor
old
man
graham
nodded
and
signed
to
the
boy
that
he
was
ready
to
start
the
night
swallowed
them
up
and
eileen
sat
waiting
whilst
the
band
played
softly
and
voices
chatted
incessantly
around
her
some
five
minutes
elapsed
ten
fifteen
it
grew
to
half
an
hour
and
she
became
uneasy
she
stood
up
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
verandah
then
the
slinking
figure
of
the
egyptian
youth
reappeared
graham
effendi
he
said
showing
his
gleaming
teeth
says
you
come
too
eileen
drew
her
wrap
more
closely
about
her
and
smiled
to
the
boy
to
lead
the
way
they
passed
out
from
the
hotel
turned
sharply
to
the
left
made
in
the
direction
of
the
river
then
bore
off
to
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
the
murmuring
life
of
mena
house
died
into
remoteness
the
discordance
of
the
arab
village
momentarily
took
precedence
then
this
in
turn
was
lost
and
they
were
making
out
to
the
hollow
which
harbours
the
sphinx
great
events
in
our
lives
rarely
leave
a
impression
often
the
in
one
career
is
a
confused
memory
a
mere
clash
of
conflicting
ideas
trivial
episodes
are
sharp
silhouettes
unforgettable
great
happenings
but
grey
vague
things
in
life
panorama
thus
eileen
never
afterwards
could
quite
recall
what
happened
that
night
the
thing
that
was
like
to
have
wrecked
her
life
had
no
sharp
outlines
to
etch
themselves
upon
the
plate
of
memory
vaguely
she
wondered
to
what
the
boy
was
leading
her
faintly
she
was
conscious
of
a
fear
of
the
growing
silence
of
a
warning
instinct
whispering
her
to
beware
of
the
loneliness
of
the
desert
then
the
boy
was
gone
the
silence
was
gone
harsh
voices
were
in
her
ears
a
cloth
was
whipped
about
her
face
and
strong
arms
lifted
her
she
was
not
of
a
stock
that
swoon
or
passively
accept
violence
she
strove
to
cry
out
but
the
band
was
too
cunningly
fastened
to
allow
of
it
she
struck
out
with
clenched
fists
and
not
unshrewdly
for
twice
her
knuckles
encountered
a
bearded
face
and
a
suppressed
exclamation
told
that
the
blows
were
not
those
of
a
weakling
she
kicked
furiously
and
drew
forth
a
howl
of
pain
from
her
captor
her
hands
flew
up
to
the
bandage
but
were
roughly
seized
thrust
down
and
behind
her
and
tied
securely
she
was
thrown
across
a
saddle
and
with
a
thrill
of
horror
knew
herself
a
captive
out
into
the
desert
she
was
borne
into
that
unknown
land
which
borders
so
closely
upon
the
track
of
cook
and
her
helplessness
her
inability
to
fight
broke
her
spirit
born
fighter
that
she
was
and
the
jarring
of
the
saddle
of
the
galloping
horse
the
dull
thud
of
the
hoofs
on
the
sand
the
iron
grip
which
held
her
fear
anger
all
melted
into
a
blank
iv
mohammed
the
dragoman
with
two
hotel
servants
came
upon
graham
some
time
later
gagged
and
bound
behind
a
sand
hillock
less
than
five
hundred
yards
from
mena
house
they
had
him
on
his
feet
in
an
instant
unbound
and
his
face
was
ghastly
for
he
knew
too
well
what
the
outrage
portended
quick
he
said
hoarsely
how
long
is
she
gone
mohammed
was
trembling
wildly
nearly
an
hour
effendi
nearly
an
hour
allah
preserve
us
what
shall
we
do
i
heard
it
in
cairo
it
is
all
over
the
bazaars
the
sheikh
with
the
is
out
they
travel
like
the
wind
effendi
it
is
not
four
days
since
they
stopped
a
caravan
ten
miles
beyond
now
they
are
in
lower
egypt
allah
preserve
her
he
ran
on
volubly
who
can
overtake
the
horsemen
of
the
bishareen
so
he
ran
on
wildly
panting
as
they
raced
back
to
the
hotel
the
place
was
in
an
uproar
it
was
an
event
which
furnished
the
guests
with
such
a
piece
of
local
colour
as
none
but
the
most
inexperienced
tourist
could
have
anticipated
an
arab
raid
in
these
days
of
electric
tramways
a
captive
snatched
from
the
very
doors
of
mena
house
one
would
as
little
expect
an
arab
raid
upon
the
the
authorities
at
headquarters
advised
of
the
occurrence
found
themselves
at
a
loss
how
to
cope
with
this
stupendous
actuality
the
desert
had
extended
its
lean
arm
and
snatched
a
captive
to
its
bosom
cairo
had
never
before
entirely
realised
the
potentialities
of
that
desert
there
are
a
thousand
ways
ten
thousand
routes
across
that
wilderness
justly
did
the
ancient
people
worship
in
the
moon
the
queenly
isis
for
when
the
silver
emblem
of
the
goddess
claims
the
sands
for
her
own
to
all
save
the
they
become
a
place
of
secrets
here
is
a
theatre
for
great
dramas
wanting
only
the
tragedian
the
outlawed
sheikh
of
the
bishareen
knew
this
full
well
but
unlike
others
who
know
it
he
had
acted
upon
his
convictions
and
revealed
to
wondering
egypt
what
bedouin
craft
and
a
band
of
intrepid
horsemen
can
do
aided
by
a
belt
of
sand
and
cloaked
by
night
graham
was
distracted
for
he
was
helpless
and
realised
it
already
the
news
was
in
cairo
and
the
machinery
of
the
government
at
work
but
what
machinery
save
that
of
the
omniscient
could
avail
him
now
a
crowd
of
visitors
flocked
around
him
offering
frightened
consolation
he
broke
away
from
them
violently
swearing
a
primitive
man
who
wanted
to
be
alone
with
his
grief
the
idea
uppermost
in
his
mind
was
that
of
leaping
upon
a
horse
and
setting
out
in
pursuit
but
in
which
direction
should
he
pursue
one
declared
that
the
arabs
must
have
rode
this
way
another
that
and
yet
another
a
third
some
one
shouted
the
words
came
to
him
as
if
through
a
thick
curtain
that
the
soldiers
were
coming
what
the
hell
the
good
of
it
he
said
and
turned
away
biting
his
lips
when
a
spruce
young
officer
came
racing
up
the
steps
to
gather
particulars
graham
stared
at
him
dully
said
the
arabs
have
got
her
my
wife
and
walked
away
the
and
accompanying
martial
disturbance
were
faint
in
the
distance
when
mohammed
ran
in
to
where
graham
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
an
agony
of
indecision
veritably
on
the
verge
of
insanity
the
dragoman
held
a
broken
gold
chain
in
his
hand
from
which
depended
a
big
turquoise
that
seemed
to
blink
in
the
shaded
light
effendi
he
whispered
and
held
it
out
upon
trembling
fingers
it
is
her
necklet
i
found
it
yonder
pointing
eastward
it
is
her
necklet
graham
turned
gave
one
wild
glance
at
the
thing
and
grasped
the
man
by
the
throat
glaring
madly
upon
him
you
dog
he
shouted
you
were
in
the
conspiracy
it
was
you
who
sent
the
false
messages
a
moment
he
held
him
so
then
dropped
his
hands
mohammed
fell
back
choking
but
no
malice
was
in
the
velvet
eyes
the
eastern
understands
and
respects
a
great
passion
effendi
he
gasped
i
am
your
faithful
servant
and
i
can
not
write
and
by
his
mercy
this
will
save
her
if
anything
can
he
turned
and
ran
fleetly
out
graham
staring
after
him
it
may
seem
singular
that
john
graham
remained
thus
inert
inactive
but
upon
further
consideration
his
attitude
becomes
explainable
he
knew
the
futility
of
a
blind
search
and
dreaded
being
absent
if
any
definite
clue
should
reach
the
hotel
meanwhile
he
felt
that
madness
was
not
far
off
they
say
that
they
have
struck
out
across
the
arabian
desert
graham
probably
in
the
direction
of
the
old
caravan
route
graham
did
not
turn
did
not
know
nor
care
who
spoke
it
four
hundred
miles
across
to
the
caravan
route
he
said
slowly
four
hundred
miles
of
sand
of
sand
v
the
most
simple
oriental
character
is
full
of
complexity
mohammed
the
dragoman
by
birth
and
education
a
thief
by
nature
a
sluggard
spared
no
effort
to
reach
cairo
in
the
shortest
space
of
time
humanly
possible
the
source
of
his
devotion
is
obscure
perhaps
it
was
due
to
a
humble
admiration
which
john
graham
attempt
to
strangle
him
could
not
alter
or
perhaps
to
a
motive
wholly
unconnected
with
mundane
matters
certain
it
is
that
a
sort
of
religious
fervour
latterly
had
possessed
the
man
from
being
something
of
a
scoffer
for
islam
like
other
creeds
daily
loses
adherents
he
was
become
a
most
devout
believer
to
what
this
should
be
ascribed
i
shall
leave
you
to
judge
exhausted
tottering
with
his
giant
exertions
he
made
his
way
through
the
tortuous
streets
of
old
cairo
streets
where
ancient
palaces
and
mansions
of
wealthy
turks
displayed
their
latticed
windows
and
at
that
hour
barred
doors
to
the
solitary
panting
wayfarer
upon
one
of
these
barred
doors
he
beat
it
was
that
of
an
old
palace
which
seemed
to
be
partially
in
ruins
after
some
delay
the
door
was
opened
and
mohammed
admitted
the
door
was
reclosed
and
following
upon
the
brief
clamour
silence
claimed
the
street
again
much
precious
time
had
elapsed
since
eileen
graham
disappearance
from
the
hotel
by
the
pyramids
when
a
belated
and
not
too
sober
greek
walking
in
the
direction
of
cairo
encountered
what
his
muddled
senses
proclaimed
to
be
an
apparition
that
of
a
figure
upon
a
camel
which
sped
silent
and
with
swiftness
past
him
towards
gizeh
about
this
vision
of
the
racing
camel
a
more
beautiful
creature
than
any
he
had
seen
since
the
last
to
carry
the
mahmal
about
the
rider
spectral
in
the
moonlight
there
was
that
which
suggested
a
vision
of
the
moslem
prophet
ere
the
frightened
greek
could
gather
courage
to
turn
and
look
after
the
phantom
rider
man
and
camel
were
lost
across
the
sands
mena
house
was
in
an
uproar
no
one
beneath
its
roof
had
thought
of
sleep
that
night
futile
searches
were
being
conducted
in
every
direction
north
south
east
and
west
graham
feeling
that
another
hour
of
inactivity
would
spell
madness
had
succumbed
to
the
fever
to
be
up
and
doing
and
had
outdistanced
all
had
left
the
boy
far
behind
and
was
mercilessly
urging
his
poor
little
mount
out
into
the
desert
well
knowing
that
in
all
probability
he
was
riding
further
and
further
away
from
the
one
he
sought
yet
madly
pressing
on
he
felt
that
to
stop
was
to
court
certain
insanity
he
must
press
on
and
on
he
must
search
search
his
mood
had
changed
and
from
cursing
fate
heaven
everything
and
every
one
he
was
come
to
prayer
he
then
was
the
next
to
see
the
man
on
the
white
camel
and
like
the
greek
he
scarcely
doubted
that
it
was
a
wraith
of
his
tortured
imagination
indeed
he
took
it
for
an
omen
the
prophet
had
appeared
to
him
to
proclaim
that
the
desert
the
home
of
islam
had
taken
eileen
from
him
the
figure
gave
no
sign
looked
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
but
straight
ahead
with
eagle
eyes
graham
pulled
up
his
donkey
and
sat
like
a
shape
of
stone
until
the
distance
swallowed
up
the
phantom
out
towards
the
oasis
called
the
well
of
seven
palms
the
straggling
military
company
proceeded
in
growing
weariness
the
officer
in
charge
had
secured
fairly
reliable
evidence
to
show
that
the
arabs
had
struck
out
straight
for
the
red
sea
since
he
was
not
omniscient
he
could
not
know
that
they
had
performed
a
wide
detour
which
would
lead
them
back
an
hour
before
dawn
to
the
camp
by
the
nile
beside
the
temple
of
horus
where
waited
for
his
captive
it
was
at
the
point
in
their
march
when
to
have
intercepted
the
raiders
they
should
have
turned
due
south
instead
of
proceeding
toward
the
oasis
that
one
of
them
pulled
up
rubbed
his
eyes
looked
again
and
gave
the
alarm
in
another
moment
they
all
saw
it
a
white
camel
not
such
a
camel
as
tourists
are
familiar
with
the
poor
hacks
of
the
species
but
a
creature
white
as
milk
bearing
a
rider
who
ignored
utterly
the
presence
of
the
soldiers
who
answered
by
no
word
or
sign
to
their
challenge
but
who
passed
them
like
a
cloud
borne
along
by
a
breeze
and
melted
vaporously
into
the
steely
distances
of
the
desert
the
captain
was
hopelessly
puzzled
too
late
to
bring
him
down
he
muttered
and
no
horse
that
was
ever
born
could
run
down
a
racing
camel
most
mysterious
twenty
miles
south
of
their
position
and
exactly
at
to
their
route
rode
the
bishareen
horsemen
the
foremost
with
eileen
graham
across
his
saddle
and
now
eighteen
miles
behind
the
bishareen
a
white
camel
of
the
pure
breed
which
yearly
furnishes
the
stately
bearer
of
the
mahmal
spurned
the
sand
and
like
a
creature
of
air
gained
upon
the
arabs
wild
riders
though
they
were
mile
upon
mile
league
upon
league
within
of
the
camp
and
with
the
desert
dawn
but
an
hour
ahead
only
a
long
concealed
from
the
eyes
of
the
bishareen
troupe
that
fleet
shape
which
had
struck
wonder
to
the
hearts
of
all
beholders
despite
their
start
of
close
upon
two
hours
despite
the
fact
that
the
soldiers
were
now
miles
and
hopeless
miles
in
their
rear
the
racer
of
the
desert
had
passed
them
eileen
graham
had
returned
to
full
and
agonizing
consciousness
for
hours
it
seemed
her
captives
had
rode
and
rode
in
silence
now
a
certain
coolness
borne
upon
the
breeze
told
her
that
they
were
nearing
the
river
again
clamour
sounded
ahead
they
were
come
to
the
arab
camp
but
ere
they
reached
it
they
entered
some
lofty
building
which
echoed
hollowly
to
the
horses
tread
she
was
lifted
from
her
painful
position
tied
fast
against
a
stone
pillar
and
the
bandage
was
unfastened
from
about
her
head
she
saw
that
she
was
lashed
to
one
of
the
ruined
pillars
which
once
had
upheld
the
great
hall
of
a
temple
about
her
were
the
crumbling
evidences
of
the
sacerdotal
splendour
that
was
ancient
egypt
the
moon
painted
massive
shadows
upon
the
debris
and
carpeted
the
outer
place
with
the
black
image
of
a
towering
propylæum
upon
the
mound
which
once
had
been
the
stone
avenue
of
approach
was
the
bedouin
camp
it
was
filled
with
a
vague
disturbance
she
was
quite
alone
for
those
who
had
brought
her
there
were
leading
their
spent
horses
out
to
the
camp
eileen
could
not
know
what
the
hushed
sounds
portended
but
actually
they
were
due
to
the
fact
that
the
outlaw
chief
wearied
with
that
most
exhausting
passion
the
passion
of
anticipation
had
sought
his
tent
issuing
orders
that
none
should
disturb
him
many
hours
before
he
knew
they
could
return
he
had
stood
looking
out
across
the
sands
but
at
last
had
decided
to
fit
himself
by
repose
for
the
reception
of
his
beautiful
captive
a
sheikh
tent
has
two
apartments
one
sacred
to
the
lord
and
master
the
other
sheltering
his
harem
to
the
former
had
withdrawn
and
now
his
emissaries
stood
at
the
entrance
where
the
symbolic
spear
was
stuck
blade
upward
in
the
sand
those
who
had
thrown
in
their
lot
with
called
the
regicide
had
learnt
that
a
robber
chief
whose
ambitions
have
been
whetted
by
a
sojourn
in
europe
is
a
hard
master
though
one
profitable
to
serve
they
hesitated
to
arouse
him
even
though
their
delicate
task
was
well
accomplished
and
whilst
they
debated
before
the
tent
which
stood
alone
as
is
usual
at
some
little
distance
from
the
others
amid
which
moved
busy
figures
engaged
in
striking
camp
eileen
within
the
temple
heard
a
movement
behind
the
pillar
to
which
she
was
bound
she
was
in
no
doubt
respecting
the
identity
of
her
captor
and
the
author
of
the
ruse
by
which
she
had
been
lured
from
the
hotel
and
now
unable
to
turn
it
came
to
her
that
this
was
creeping
to
her
through
the
shadows
with
eyes
closed
and
her
teeth
clenched
convulsively
she
pictured
the
sinister
approaching
figure
then
from
close
beside
her
came
a
voice
only
i
can
save
you
from
him
do
not
hesitate
do
not
speak
do
as
i
tell
you
eileen
opened
her
eyes
she
could
not
see
the
speaker
but
the
voice
was
oddly
familiar
her
fevered
brain
told
her
that
she
had
heard
it
before
but
speaking
arabic
it
was
the
voice
of
an
old
man
but
a
strong
vibrant
voice
it
is
the
will
of
allah
whose
name
be
exalted
that
i
repay
a
lean
hand
held
before
her
eyes
a
broken
gold
chain
upon
which
depended
a
turquoise
she
knew
the
voice
now
it
was
that
of
the
old
pedlar
but
his
english
except
for
the
hoarse
eastern
accent
was
flawless
and
this
was
the
tone
of
no
broken
old
man
but
of
one
to
be
feared
and
respected
her
reason
she
thought
must
be
tricking
her
how
could
the
old
pedlar
however
strong
in
his
queer
gratitude
save
her
now
then
the
hand
came
again
before
her
eyes
and
it
held
a
tiny
green
phial
be
brave
drink
quickly
they
are
coming
to
take
you
to
him
it
is
the
only
escape
oh
god
she
whispered
and
turned
icily
cold
this
was
the
boon
he
brought
her
this
was
the
road
of
escape
escape
from
the
road
of
death
it
was
cruel
unspeakably
horrible
with
a
bright
world
just
opening
out
to
her
with
youth
beauty
and
she
could
not
think
of
her
husband
god
be
merciful
to
him
she
murmured
but
he
would
prefer
me
dead
to
quick
they
are
here
she
placed
her
lips
to
the
phial
and
drank
it
seemed
that
fire
ran
through
every
vein
in
her
body
then
came
chill
it
grew
creeping
from
her
hands
and
her
feet
inward
and
upward
to
her
heart
dear
she
whispered
and
sobbed
once
dryly
the
ropes
held
her
rigidly
upright
vi
she
is
dead
and
we
have
slain
her
bedouins
stood
before
the
pillar
in
the
temple
and
fear
was
in
their
eyes
they
unbound
the
girl
beautiful
yet
in
her
marble
pallor
and
lowered
her
rigid
body
to
the
ground
they
looked
one
at
another
and
many
a
glance
was
turned
toward
the
nile
then
the
leader
of
the
party
extended
a
brown
hand
pointing
to
the
tethered
horses
they
passed
from
the
temple
muttering
no
one
among
them
dared
to
brave
the
wrath
of
the
terrible
sheikh
as
they
came
out
into
the
paling
moonlight
the
camp
seemed
to
have
melted
magically
for
ere
dawn
they
began
their
long
march
to
the
lonely
oasis
in
the
arabian
desert
which
was
the
secret
base
of
the
depredatory
operations
stealthily
circling
the
camp
which
buzzed
with
subdued
activity
even
the
dogs
seemed
to
be
silent
when
the
sheikh
slept
they
came
to
the
horses
solitary
a
square
silhouette
against
the
paling
blue
stood
the
sheikh
tent
on
top
of
the
mound
which
alone
was
still
untouched
the
first
horseman
had
actually
leapt
into
the
saddle
and
the
others
with
furtive
glances
at
the
ominous
hillock
were
about
to
do
likewise
when
a
low
wail
weird
eerie
rose
above
the
muffled
stirring
of
the
camp
groaned
one
of
the
party
what
is
that
again
the
wail
sounded
and
again
other
woman
voices
took
it
up
it
electrified
the
whole
camp
escape
undetected
was
no
longer
possible
men
women
and
children
were
abandoning
their
tasks
and
standing
petrified
with
the
awe
of
it
and
looking
towards
the
sheikh
tent
as
they
looked
as
the
frightened
fugitives
hesitated
looking
also
from
the
tent
issued
forth
a
melancholy
procession
it
was
composed
of
the
women
of
household
they
beat
their
bared
breasts
and
cast
dust
upon
their
heads
for
within
his
own
sacred
apartment
lay
the
sheikh
in
his
blood
a
headless
corpse
and
now
those
who
had
trembled
before
him
were
hot
to
avenge
him
riders
plunged
out
in
directions
as
diverse
as
the
spokes
of
a
wheel
four
of
them
rode
madly
through
the
temple
where
they
had
left
the
body
of
their
captive
leaping
the
debris
and
circling
about
the
towering
pillars
as
only
arab
horsemen
can
out
into
the
sands
they
swept
and
before
them
from
out
of
a
hollow
rose
an
apparition
that
brought
all
four
up
short
their
steeds
upreared
upon
their
haunches
it
was
the
figure
of
a
man
and
wearing
the
green
turban
mounted
upon
a
camel
which
to
the
eyes
of
the
four
looked
in
its
spotless
whiteness
a
creature
of
another
world
before
the
stranger
lay
the
still
form
of
eileen
graham
and
as
the
camel
rose
to
its
feet
its
rider
turned
swung
something
high
above
him
and
hurled
it
back
at
the
pursuers
right
amongst
their
horses
feet
it
rolled
and
up
at
them
in
the
moonlight
from
out
a
mass
of
beard
stared
the
glassy
eyes
of
the
sun
was
high
in
the
heavens
when
the
and
searchers
came
straggling
back
to
mena
house
two
of
them
who
had
come
upon
graham
ten
miles
to
the
east
brought
him
in
he
was
quite
passive
and
offered
no
protest
spoke
no
word
but
stared
straight
in
front
of
him
with
a
set
smile
that
was
dreadful
to
see
no
news
had
come
from
the
company
of
soldiers
no
news
had
come
from
anywhere
it
was
ghastly
inconceivable
people
looked
at
one
another
and
asked
if
it
could
really
be
possible
that
one
of
their
number
had
been
snatched
out
from
their
midst
in
such
fashion
officials
military
and
civil
literally
in
crowds
besieged
the
hotel
amid
that
scene
of
confusion
no
one
missed
mohammed
but
when
all
the
rest
had
given
up
in
despair
he
a
solitary
patient
figure
stood
out
upon
a
distant
mound
watching
the
desert
road
to
the
east
he
alone
saw
the
return
of
the
white
camel
with
its
double
burden
from
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
or
more
for
he
dared
approach
no
closer
but
stood
with
bowed
head
pronouncing
the
over
and
over
again
he
saw
it
kneel
saw
its
rider
descend
and
lift
a
girl
from
its
back
he
saw
him
force
something
between
her
lips
saw
him
turn
and
make
a
deep
obeisance
toward
mecca
at
that
he
too
knelt
and
did
likewise
when
he
arose
camel
and
rider
were
gone
he
raced
across
the
sands
as
eileen
graham
opened
her
eyes
and
supported
her
as
she
struggled
to
her
feet
pale
and
trembling
i
do
understand
it
at
all
said
graham
eileen
smiled
up
at
him
from
the
long
cane
chair
she
was
not
yet
recovered
from
her
dreadful
experience
perhaps
she
said
softly
you
will
not
laugh
in
future
at
my
irish
stories
of
the
people
graham
shook
his
head
and
turned
to
mohammed
what
does
it
all
mean
mohammed
he
said
thank
god
it
means
that
i
have
got
her
back
but
how
was
it
done
she
returned
wearing
the
turquoise
necklace
which
i
last
saw
in
your
hand
mohammed
looked
aside
i
took
it
to
him
effendi
it
was
the
token
by
which
he
knew
her
need
the
pedlar
the
pedlar
effendi
you
knew
where
to
find
him
then
i
knew
where
to
find
him
but
i
feared
to
tell
you
feared
that
you
might
ridicule
him
he
ceased
he
was
become
oddly
reticent
graham
shrugged
his
shoulders
helplessly
i
only
hope
the
authorities
will
succeed
in
capturing
the
bishareen
brigands
he
said
grimly
the
authorities
will
never
capture
them
replied
the
dragoman
with
conviction
for
five
years
they
have
lived
by
plunder
and
laughed
at
the
government
but
before
another
moon
is
risen
he
was
warming
to
his
usual
eloquence
now
no
will
remain
in
the
land
they
will
be
exterminated
purged
from
the
desert
indeed
said
graham
by
whom
by
the
rawallah
effendi
are
they
a
bedouin
tribe
the
greatest
of
them
all
then
why
should
they
undertake
the
duty
because
it
is
the
will
of
the
one
who
saved
her
for
you
effendi
i
am
blessed
that
i
have
set
eyes
upon
him
spoken
with
him
paradise
is
assured
to
me
because
my
hand
returned
to
him
his
turban
when
it
lay
in
the
dust
graham
stared
looking
from
his
wife
who
lay
back
smiling
dreamily
to
mohammed
whose
dark
eyes
burnt
with
a
strange
fervour
the
fervour
of
one
mysteriously
converted
to
an
almost
fanatic
faith
are
you
speaking
of
our
old
friend
the
pedlar
i
am
almost
afraid
to
speak
of
him
effendi
for
he
is
the
chosen
of
heaven
a
cleanser
of
uncleanliness
the
scourge
of
god
who
holds
his
flail
in
his
hand
the
broom
of
the
desert
graham
who
had
been
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
paused
in
front
of
mohammed
who
is
he
then
he
asked
quietly
i
owe
him
a
debt
i
can
never
hope
to
repay
so
i
should
at
least
like
to
know
his
real
name
i
almost
fear
to
speak
it
effendi
mohammed
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
and
he
raised
the
turquoise
hanging
by
the
thin
chain
about
eileen
throat
and
reverently
touched
it
with
his
lips
he
is
