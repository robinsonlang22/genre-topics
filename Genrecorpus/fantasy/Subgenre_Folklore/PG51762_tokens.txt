david

long
acre
preface
there
is
at
least
one
spot
in
the
world
where
fairies
are
still
believed
in
and
where
if
you
look
in
the
right
places
they
may
still
be
found
and
that
is
the
little
island
from
which
these
stories
come
ellan
vannin
the
isle
of
mann
but
i
have
used
a
word
which
should
not
be
mentioned
here
they
are
never
called
fairies
by
the
manx
but
themselves
or
the
little
people
or
the
little
fellows
or
the
little
ones
or
sometimes
even
the
lil
boys
these
little
people
are
not
the
tiny
creatures
with
wings
who
flutter
about
in
many
english
fairy
tales
but
they
are
small
persons
from
two
to
three
feet
in
height
otherwise
very
like
mortals
they
wear
red
caps
and
green
jackets
and
are
very
fond
of
hunting
indeed
they
are
most
often
seen
on
horseback
followed
by
packs
of
little
hounds
of
all
the
colours
of
the
rainbow
they
are
rather
inclined
to
be
mischievous
and
spiteful
and
that
is
why
they
are
called
by
such
good
names
in
case
they
should
be
listening
besides
these
little
fellows
there
are
other
more
alarming
folk
there
is
the
fynoderee
who
is
large
ugly
hairy
and
enormously
strong
but
not
so
bad
as
he
looks
for
often
he
helps
on
the
farm
during
the
night
by
thrashing
corn
he
does
not
like
to
be
seen
so
if
a
farmer
wants
work
done
by
him
he
must
take
care
to
keep
out
of
the
fynoderee
way
then
far
uglier
than
fynoderee
are
the
bugganes
who
are
horrible
and
cruel
creatures
they
can
appear
in
any
shape
they
please
as
ogres
with
huge
heads
and
great
fiery
eyes
or
without
any
heads
at
all
as
small
dogs
who
grow
larger
and
larger
as
you
watch
them
until
they
are
larger
than
elephants
when
perhaps
they
turn
into
the
shape
of
men
or
disappear
into
nothing
as
horned
monsters
or
anything
they
choose
each
buggane
has
his
own
particular
a
dark
a
lonely
hill
or
a
ruined
keeill
or
church
there
are
many
others
too
but
these
are
the
chief
most
of
the
stories
are
traditional
and
have
been
handed
down
by
word
of
mouth
from
father
to
son

i
there
was
a
man
once
in
the
isle
of
mann
who
met
one
of
the
little
fellows
and
the
little
fellow
told
him
that
if
he
would
go
to
london
bridge
and
dig
he
would
find
a
fortune
so
he
went
and
when
he
got
there
he
began
to
dig
and
another
man
came
to
him
and
said
are
you
doing
of
themselves
told
me
to
come
to
london
bridge
and
i
would
get
a
fortune
says
he
and
the
other
man
said
dreamed
that
i
was
back
in
the
lil
islan
an
i
was
at
a
house
with
a
at
the
chimley
of
it
and
if
i
would
dig
there
i
would
find
a
fortune
but
i
wouldn
go
for
it
was
only
foolishness
then
he
told
him
so
plainly
about
the
house
that
the
first
man
knew
it
was
his
own
so
he
went
back
to
the
island
when
he
got
home
he
dug
under
the
little
by
the
chimney
and
he
found
an
iron
box
he
opened
the
box
and
it
was
full
of
gold
and
there
was
a
letter
in
it
but
he
could
not
read
the
letter
because
it
was
in
a
foreign
language
so
he
put
it
in
the
smithy
window
and
challenged
any
scholar
who
went
by
to
read
it
none
of
them
could
but
at
last
one
big
boy
said
it
was
latin
and
it
meant
again
and
you
find
another
so
the
man
dug
again
under
the
and
what
did
he
find
but
another
iron
box
full
of
gold
and
from
that
day
till
the
day
of
his
death
that
man
used
to
open
the
front
door
before
going
to
bed
and
call
out
blessing
with
the
little
fellows
ii
here
is
a
true
story
that
was
told
me
by
a
man
named
james
moore
when
i
was
sitting
with
him
by
the
fire
one
evening
he
said
not
much
of
a
believer
in
most
of
the
stories
some
ones
is
telling
but
after
all
a
body
ca
help
believing
a
thing
they
happen
to
see
for
themselves
remember
one
winter
night
we
were
living
in
a
house
at
the
time
that
was
pulled
down
for
the
building
of
the
big
wheel
it
was
a
thatched
house
with
two
rooms
and
a
wall
about
six
foot
high
dividing
them
and
from
that
it
was
open
to
the
scrahs
or
turfs
that
were
laid
across
the
rafters
my
mother
was
sitting
at
the
fire
busy
spinning
and
my
father
was
sitting
in
the
big
chair
at
the
end
of
the
table
taking
a
chapter
for
us
out
of
the
manx
bible
my
brother
was
busy
winding
a
spool
and
i
was
working
with
a
bunch
of
ling
trying
to
make
two
or
three
pegs
there
a
terrible
glisther
on
my
mother
said
looking
at
the
fire
an
the
rain
comin
peltin
down
the
chimley
yes
said
my
father
shutting
the
bible
an
we
better
get
to
bed
middlin
soon
and
let
the
lil
ones
in
to
a
bit
of
shelter
we
all
got
ready
and
went
to
bed
time
in
the
night
my
brother
wakened
me
with
a
sh
ish
listen
boy
an
look
at
the
big
light
tha
in
the
kitchen
then
he
rubbed
his
eyes
a
bit
and
whispered
what
mother
doin
now
at
all
listen
i
said
an
you
hear
mother
in
bed
it
not
her
at
all
it
must
be
the
little
ones
that
agate
of
the
wheel
both
of
us
got
frightened
and
down
with
our
heads
under
the
clothes
and
fell
asleep
in
the
morning
when
we
got
up
we
told
them
what
we
had
seen
first
thing
aw
like
enough
like
enough
my
father
said
looking
at
the
wheel
it
seems
your
mother
forgot
to
take
the
band
off
last
night
a
thing
people
should
be
careful
about
for
it
givin
themselves
power
over
the
wheel
an
though
their
meanin
well
enough
the
they
doin
is
nothin
to
brag
about
the
weaver
is
always
about
their
work
an
the
bad
joinin
they
makin
in
the
rolls
i
remember
it
as
well
as
yesterday
the
big
light
that
was
at
them
and
the
whirring
that
was
going
on
and
let
anybody
say
what
they
like
that
a
thing
i
seen
and
heard
for
myself
iii
one
evening
a
young
man
who
was
serving
his
time
as
a
weaver
was
walking
home
late
from
douglas
to
glen
meay
he
had
often
been
boasting
that
he
had
never
seen
any
of
the
little
people
well
this
night
he
was
coming
along
the
john
road
and
when
he
got
near
to
the
river
a
big
big
bull
stood
across
the
road
before
him
he
took
his
stick
and
gave
it
one
big
knock
it
went
into
the
river
and
he
never
saw
it
any
more
after
that
when
he
got
to
the
parson
bridge
he
met
a
little
thing
just
like
a
spinning
wheel
and
there
was
a
little
little
body
sitting
where
the
spool
is
well
he
lifted
his
stick
again
and
struck
the
little
body
that
was
sitting
on
the
spool
a
hard
knock
with
his
stick
the
little
body
said
to
him
jean
shen
arragh
which
means
do
that
again
he
walked
on
then
till
he
got
to
glen
meay
and
told
what
he
had
seen
in
a
house
there
then
another
man
said
he
had
seen
the
little
old
woman
sitting
on
the
top
of
the
spool
of
the
spinning
wheel
and
coming
down
raby
hill
at
dark
so
it
took
her
a
long
time
for
the
first
man
met
her
at
six
and
the
second
at
eleven
and
there
two
miles
between
the
two
places
so
they
were
saying
when
the
cycles
came
in
that
the
little
people
had
been
before
them
and
this
is
a
true
story
the
buggane
of
glen
meay
waterfall
there
was
once
a
woman
living
near
glen
meay
and
she
was
the
wife
of
a
decent
quiet
striving
man
of
the
place
there
was
no
one
but
herself
and
the
man
and
they
had
a
nice
little
cottage
and
owned
a
bit
of
a
croft
on
which
they
grazed
a
cow
and
a
few
sheep
and
grew
enough
potatoes
to
do
them
the
winter
out
and
the
man
had
a
yawl
and
went
to
the
fishing
when
things
were
slack
on
land
but
for
all
that
they
were
not
comfortable
for
work
as
hard
as
the
man
might
at
his
farming
and
his
fishing
he
was
kept
as
poor
as
lazarus
by
a
lazy
wife
for
the
woman
was
fonder
of
lying
in
the
morning
than
sitting
at
her
milking
stool
indeed
the
neighbours
had
it
to
say
that
she
wore
out
more
blankets
than
shoes
many
a
day
her
man
would
be
going
out
early
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
without
a
bite
or
a
sup
in
him
one
morning
when
he
came
in
from
work
for
his
breakfast
there
was
no
fire
his
wife
was
never
up
well
my
poor
man
had
nothing
for
it
but
to
get
his
own
breakfast
ready
and
go
back
to
his
work
when
he
came
in
for
dinner
it
happened
as
it
had
happened
for
breakfast
luck
to
her
laziness
he
thought
is
coul
comfort
for
a
poor
man
but
i
play
a
trick
on
her
for
it
and
with
that
he
fetched
a
bart
of
straw
and
bunged
the
two
windows
of
his
house
then
he
went
back
to
his
work
the
sun
had
not
yet
set
when
he
came
home
in
the
evening
his
wife
was
lying
in
bed
waiting
for
day
woman
he
shouted
haste
an
get
up
to
see
the
sun
rise
in
the
wes
up
jumped
the
wife
and
ran
to
the
door
just
as
the
sun
was
going
down
and
the
sight
terrified
her
the
whole
sky
looked
like
fire
and
she
thought
that
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
but
next
morning
it
all
happened
as
it
had
happened
before
and
himself
said
to
her
it
the
buggane
sure
enough
that
be
having
thee
one
of
these
days
if
thou
do
mend
thy
ways
buggane
said
she
me
no
questions
said
he
i
tell
thee
no
lies
but
the
big
black
hairy
fellow
that
lies
under
the
spooyt
vooar
that
i
meanin
houl
yer
tongue
man
thou
do
frecken
me
wi
thy
bugganes
shouted
the
woman
in
the
evening
the
man
left
the
house
to
go
out
to
the
fishing
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
the
woman
took
a
notion
in
her
head
to
bake
as
she
had
only
the
heel
o
the
loaf
left
for
breakfast
now
themselves
ca
stand
lazy
ways
and
baking
after
sunset
is
the
one
thing
they
wo
abide
she
who
does
so
will
meet
their
revenge
something
is
sure
to
be
taken
by
them
but
seldom
worse
than
some
of
the
live
stock
well
the
woman
set
to
work
to
bake
some
barley
bread
and
flour
cake
first
she
went
out
to
get
gorse
to
put
under
the
griddle
slipping
the
bolt
on
the
door
as
she
came
in
that
none
of
the
neighbours
would
catch
her
and
cry
shame
on
her
for
baking
after
sunset
she
got
some
meal
out
of
the
barrel
and
put
it
on
the
round
table
and
put
salt
and
water
on
it
and
then
she
kneaded
the
meal
and
clapped
a
cake
out
as
thin
as
sixpence
with
her
hands
but
she
was
only
a
middling
poor
baker
one
of
the
sort
that
has
to
use
a
knife
to
make
the
cake
of
a
right
round
she
had
turned
the
cake
twice
and
taken
it
off
and
brushed
the
griddle
with
a
white
goose
wing
ready
for
the
next
cake
which
she
was
busy
cutting
round
with
her
knife
just
at
that
moment
there
was
heard
the
sound
of
something
heavy
lumbering
up
to
the
door
after
a
few
seconds
something
fumbled
at
the
sneg
of
the
door
then
something
knocked
high
up
on
the
door
and
a
voice
like
the
thick
gruff
voice
of
a
giant
was
heard
saying
open
for
me
she
made
no
answer
again
there
was
a
loud
knock
and
a
big
hoarse
voice
was
heard
which
cried
of
the
house
open
for
me
then
the
door
burst
open
and
behold
ye
what
should
she
see
but
a
great
big
ugly
beast
of
a
buggane
rushing
in
mad
with
rage
without
as
much
as
a
your
leave
he
made
one
grab
at
her
and
clutched
hold
of
her
by
her
apron
and
swung
her
on
his
shoulder
and
away
with
him
before
she
knew
where
she
was
he
rushed
her
across
the
fields
and
down
the
hill
till
he
brought
her
to
the
top
of
the
spooyt
vooar
the
big
waterfall
of
glen
meay
as
the
buggane
tore
down
the
hill
the
woman
felt
the
ground
tremble
under
his
feet
and
the
noise
of
the
waterfall
filled
her
ears
and
there
in
front
of
her
she
saw
the
stream
turn
to
white
spray
as
it
came
leaping
down
the
rocks
as
the
buggane
swung
her
in
the
air
to
throw
her
into
the
deep
pool
she
thought
that
her
last
hour
had
come
then
all
at
once
she
remembered
the
knife
that
she
held
in
her
hand
quick
as
thought
she
cut
the
string
of
her
apron
and
down
she
tumbled
to
the
ground
rolling
over
and
over
down
the
hill
and
before
he
knew
where
he
was
the
buggane
with
the
speed
he
had
on
him
pitched
forward
head
first
down
the
rushing
spooyt
vooar
as
he
went
head
over
heels
and
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
pool
with
a
souse
you
have
heard
half
a
mile
away
she
heard
him
give
a
roar
out
of
him
rumbyl
rumbyl
sambyl
i
thought
i
had
a
lazy
dirt
and
i
have
but
the
edge
of
her
skirt
and
that
was
the
last
that
was
seen
of
that
fellow
how
the
manx
cat
lost
her
tail
when
noah
was
calling
the
animals
into
the
ark
there
was
one
cat
who
was
out
mousing
and
took
no
notice
when
he
was
calling
to
her
she
was
a
good
mouser
but
this
time
she
had
trouble
to
find
a
mouse
and
she
took
a
notion
that
she
would
go
into
the
ark
without
one
so
at
last
when
noah
had
all
the
animals
safe
inside
and
he
saw
the
rain
beginning
to
fall
and
no
sign
of
her
coming
in
he
said
out
is
out
and
who
in
is
in
and
with
that
he
was
just
closing
the
door
when
the
cat
came
running
up
half
drowned
why
cats
hate
the
water
and
just
squeezed
in
in
time
but
noah
had
slammed
the
door
as
she
ran
in
and
it
cut
off
her
tail
so
she
got
in
without
it
and
that
is
why
manx
cats
have
no
tails
to
this
day
that
cat
said
bee
bo
bend
it
my
tail
ended
and
i
go
to
mann
and
get
copper
nails
and
mend
it
the
making
of
mann
thousands
of
years
ago
at
the
time
of
the
battles
of
the
giants
in
ireland
finn
mac
cooil
was
fighting
with
a
great
scotch
giant
who
had
come
over
to
challenge
him
he
beat
him
and
chased
him
eastwards
towards
the
sea
but
the
scotch
giant
was
a
faster
runner
and
began
to
get
ahead
of
him
so
finn
who
was
afraid
that
he
would
jump
into
the
sea
and
escape
stooped
down
and
clutched
a
great
handful
of
the
soil
of
ireland
to
throw
at
him
he
cast
it
but
he
missed
his
enemy
and
the
great
lump
of
earth
fell
into
the
midst
of
the
irish
sea
it
is
the
isle
of
mann
and
the
great
hole
which
finn
made
where
he
tore
it
up
is
lough
neagh
there
were
men
too
in
ireland
in
those
days
as
well
as
giants
and
to
some
of
them
it
seemed
to
happen
in
a
different
way
men
do
not
always
understand
the
doings
of
giants
because
men
live
it
may
be
said
in
the
footprints
of
the
giants
it
seems
that
at
this
time
the
irish
tribes
were
gathered
in
two
great
forces
getting
ready
to
meet
the
plunderers
who
had
left
scotland
and
were
at
work
on
their
own
coast
their
blood
got
too
hot
and
they
went
into
each
other
in
downright
earnest
to
show
how
they
would
do
with
the
rascals
when
they
came
to
their
confusion
for
they
lost
hold
over
themselves
they
got
into
boggy
ground
and
were
in
great
danger
the
leaders
seeing
that
it
was
going
to
mean
a
big
loss
of
life
got
all
their
men
together
on
a
big
patch
of
dry
ground
that
happened
to
be
in
the
when
all
of
a
sudden
a
darkness
came
overhead
and
the
ground
began
to
shake
and
tremble
with
the
weight
of
the
people
and
the
stir
there
was
at
them
and
then
it
disappeared
people
and
all
some
said
that
it
took
plunge
and
sank
into
the
bog
with
the
people
on
it
others
said
that
it
was
lifted
up
and
the
people
on
it
dropped
off
into
the
swamp
no
doubt
the
darkness
that
was
caused
by
the
hand
of
finn
made
it
hard
to
see
just
how
it
happened
however
that
may
be
a
while
after
this
they
said
the
sea
was
surging
dreadful
and
the
men
in
the
boats
had
to
hold
to
the
sides
or
it
out
have
been
thrown
and
behold
ye
a
few
days
after
this
there
was
land
seen
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
where
no
man
ever
saw
the
like
before
you
may
know
that
this
story
is
true
because
the
irish
have
always
looked
on
the
isle
of
mann
as
a
parcel
of
their
own
land
they
say
that
when
saint
patrick
put
the
blessing
of
god
on
the
soil
of
ireland
and
all
creatures
that
might
live
upon
it
the
power
of
that
blessing
was
felt
at
the
same
time
in
the
island
saint
patrick
was
a
mighty
man
he
was
a
saint
so
clever
he
gave
the
snakes
and
toads
a
twisht
and
banished
them
for
ever
and
there
is
proof
of
the
truth
of
the
saying
to
this
day
for
while
such
nasty
things
do
live
in
england
they
can
not
breathe
freely
on
the
blessed
soil
the
island
was
much
larger
then
than
it
is
now
but
the
magician
who
for
a
time
ruled
over
it
as
a
revenge
on
one
of
his
enemies
raised
a
furious
wind
in
the
air
and
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
this
wind
tore
several
pieces
off
the
land
and
cast
them
into
the
sea
they
floated
about
and
were
changed
into
the
dangerous
rocks
which
are
now
so
much
feared
by
ships
the
smaller
pieces
became
the
shifting
sands
which
wave
round
the
coast
and
are
sometimes
seen
and
sometimes
disappear
later
the
island
was
known
as
ellan
sheaynt
the
isle
of
peace
or
the
holy
island
it
was
a
place
where
there
was
always
sunshine
and
the
singing
of
birds
the
scent
of
sweet
flowers
and
blossoming
the
whole
year
round
there
was
always
enough
there
to
eat
and
drink
and
the
horses
of
that
place
were
fine
and
the
women
beautiful
the
coming
of
saint
patrick
it
was
the
time
that
saint
patrick
was
coming
on
horseback
to
mann
over
the
sea
from
ireland
when
he
drew
near
to
the
land
manannan
mac
y
leirr
that
great
wizard
that
was
ruler
of
mann
put
a
charm
out
of
him
that
made
the
air
round
the
island
thick
with
mist
so
that
neither
sun
nor
sky
nor
sea
nor
land
could
be
seen
patrick
rode
into
the
thick
of
the
mist
but
try
as
he
would
he
could
find
no
way
out
of
it
and
behind
him
there
was
a
great
waiting
to
swallow
him
up
he
did
know
in
his
seven
senses
where
he
was
east
or
west
and
was
for
turning
back
when
there
came
to
his
ears
the
cry
of
a
curlew
calling
you
come
you
come
you
then
he
said
to
himself
curlew
will
be
down
feeding
among
the
rocks
she
will
be
calling
to
her
young
after
that
he
heard
the
bleat
of
a
goat
beware
beware
and
he
said
to
himself
the
goat
bleats
for
the
fall
of
her
kid
there
will
be
a
steep
bit
of
a
hill
last
of
all
he
heard
the
crow
of
a
cock
to
us
come
come
then
said
patrick
believe
on
me
sowl
i
back
of
peel
hill
and
with
that
he
took
one
leap
on
to
the
little
island
and
put
his
horse
up
the
sheer
rock
soon
he
stood
sure
enough
at
the
top
of
peel
hill
as
he
stood
there
he
cried
out
blessing
on
the
curlew
no
man
afther
this
is
to
find
her
nest
blessing
on
the
goat
an
no
man
is
to
see
her
bring
forth
her
young
blessing
on
the
cock
an
he
shall
crow
at
dawn
ever
afther
at
this
same
hour
he
cursed
the
sea
beast
and
turned
him
into
a
solid
rock
and
there
he
lies
now
with
his
great
fin
on
his
back
where
the
horse
hoofs
struck
the
top
of
the
hill
there
sprang
a
well
of
pure
water
of
which
man
and
horse
drank
and
it
is
called
the
holy
well
of
saint
patrick
to
this
day
if
you
go
down
to
the
ledges
of
the
rock
which
were
made
by
the
horse
hoofs
as
he
clambered
up
you
may
see
the
footprints
still
when
patrick
looked
about
him
the
mist
was
lifting
and
he
saw
a
great
host
of
warriors
round
manannan
faery
mound
with
the
first
rays
of
the
rising
sun
shining
on
their
spears
but
the
saint
knew
that
they
were
phantoms
raised
by
manannan
magic
power
and
he
bade
them
to
be
gone
and
behold
they
and
their
master
in
the
shape
of
men
whirled
round
and
round
like
wheels
before
the
swift
wind
which
could
not
overtake
them
till
they
came
to
spanish
head
there
they
whirled
over
the
houghs
so
quickly
and
lightly
that
the
gulls
on
the
ledges
below
were
not
disturbed
then
on
over
the
rough
grey
irish
sea
till
they
came
to
the
enchanted
island
fifteen
miles
of
the
calf
once
there
manannan
dropped
the
isle
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
he
and
his
company
were
seen
no
more
saint
patrick
on
his
horse
stood
still
on
peel
hill
and
blessed
the
island
where
he
had
touched
land
and
blessed
it
has
been
to
this
day
then
he
leapt
on
to
the
little
islet
that
he
saw
below
him
ever
since
it
has
been
called
saint
patrick
isle
and
from
the
rocks
on
its
northern
side
he
watched
the
fierce
storm
which
manannan
going
had
made
just
then
a
brave
ship
with
foresail
and
mainsail
gone
was
driving
straight
for
the
terrible
rocks
saint
patrick
raised
his
mailed
hand
and
the
tempest
was
calmed
the
good
ship
righted
herself
again
and
those
on
board
were
saved
they
looked
up
with
awe
and
thankfulness
at
the
rider
in
his
shining
armour
on
the
steed
standing
bright
against
the
blackness
of
the
rocks
and
ever
since
that
day
the
fisherman
as
he
sails
past
the
horse
rock
has
offed
with
his
cap
and
put
up
this
bit
of
a
prayer
to
good
saint
patrick
saint
patrick
who
blessed
our
island
bless
us
and
our
boat
going
out
well
coming
in
better
with
living
and
dead
in
the
boat
how
the
herring
became
king
of
the
sea
the
old
fishermen
of
the
island
have
it
to
say
that
years
and
years
ago
the
fish
met
to
choose
themselves
a
king
for
they
had
no
deemster
to
tell
them
what
was
right
likely
enough
their
was
off
the
shoulder
south
of
the
calf
they
all
came
looking
their
best
there
was
captain
jiarg
the
red
gurnet
in
his
fine
crimson
coat
grey
horse
the
shark
big
and
cruel
the
bollan
in
his
brightest
colours
dirty
peggy
the
putting
her
nicest
face
on
herself
athag
the
haddock
trying
to
rub
out
the
black
spots
the
devil
burnt
on
him
when
he
took
hold
of
him
with
his
finger
and
thumb
and
all
the
rest
each
one
thought
he
might
be
chosen
the
fish
had
a
strong
notion
to
make
brac
gorm
the
mackerel
king
he
knew
that
and
he
went
and
put
beautiful
lines
and
stripes
on
himself
pink
and
green
and
gold
and
all
the
colours
of
the
sea
and
sky
then
he
was
thinking
diamonds
of
himself
but
when
he
came
he
looked
that
grand
that
they
did
know
him
so
they
said
that
he
was
artificial
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
in
the
end
it
was
skeddan
the
herring
the
lil
silver
fella
who
was
made
king
of
the
sea
when
it
was
all
over
up
came
the
fluke
too
late
to
give
his
vote
and
they
all
called
out
missed
the
tide
my
beauty
it
seems
that
he
had
been
so
busy
tallivating
himself
up
touching
himself
up
red
in
places
that
he
forgot
how
time
went
when
he
found
that
the
herring
had
been
chosen
he
twisted
up
his
mouth
on
one
side
and
says
he
what
am
i
goin
to
be
then
that
says
scarrag
the
skate
and
he
ups
with
his
tail
and
gives
the
fluke
a
slap
on
his
mouth
that
knocked
his
mouth
crooked
on
him
and
so
it
has
been
ever
since
and
maybe
it
because
the
herring
is
king
of
the
sea
that
he
has
so
much
honour
among
men
even
the
deemsters
when
they
take
their
oath
say
will
execute
justice
as
indifferently
as
the
backbone
doth
lie
in
the
midst
of
the
fish
and
the
manx
people
will
not
burn
the
herring
bones
in
the
fire
in
case
the
herring
should
feel
it
it
is
to
be
remembered
too
that
the
best
herring
in
the
world
are
caught
in
this
place
off
the
shoulder
where
the
fish
held
their
big
meeting
and
that
is
because
it
is
not
very
far
from
manannan
enchanted
island
the
silver
cup
there
was
once
a
man
living
in
the
south
of
the
island
whose
name
was
colcheragh
he
was
a
farmer
and
he
had
poultry
on
his
street
sheep
on
the
mountain
and
cattle
in
the
meadow
land
alongside
the
river
his
cows
were
the
best
cows
in
the
parish
nowhere
could
you
see
such
a
fine
head
of
cattle
as
he
had
they
were
the
pride
of
his
heart
and
they
served
him
well
with
milk
and
butter
but
after
a
time
he
began
to
think
that
something
was
amiss
with
the
cows
he
went
to
the
the
first
thing
every
morning
and
one
morning
he
noticed
the
cows
looking
so
tired
they
could
hardly
stand
when
it
came
to
milking
time
they
found
not
a
drop
of
milk
the
girls
who
went
out
to
milk
the
cows
came
back
with
empty
cans
saying
milk
has
gone
up
into
the
cows
horns
colcheragh
began
to
think
that
some
one
had
put
an
evil
eye
on
his
cows
so
he
swept
up
some
of
the
dust
from
the
cross
close
by
in
a
shovel
and
sprinkled
it
on
their
backs
but
the
cows
got
no
better
then
he
wondered
if
some
one
was
coming
at
night
to
steal
the
milk
he
made
up
his
mind
to
sit
in
the
all
night
to
see
if
he
could
catch
the
thief
so
one
night
after
everyone
had
gone
to
bed
he
crept
out
of
the
house
and
hid
himself
under
some
straw
in
a
corner
of
the
hour
after
hour
of
the
dark
lonesome
night
crept
on
and
he
heard
nothing
but
the
cows
breathing
and
their
rustle
in
the
straw
he
was
very
cold
and
stiff
and
he
had
just
made
up
his
mind
to
go
into
the
house
when
a
glimmering
light
showed
under
the
door
and
then
he
heard
things
laughing
and
talking
queer
talk
he
knew
that
they
were
not
right
people
the
door
opened
and
in
came
a
whole
lot
of
little
men
dressed
in
green
coats
and
leather
caps
keeking
through
the
straw
he
saw
their
horns
hung
by
their
sides
their
whips
in
their
hands
and
scores
of
little
dogs
of
every
colour
green
blue
yellow
scarlet
and
every
colour
you
can
think
of
at
their
heels
the
cows
were
lying
down
the
little
fellows
loosed
the
yokes
from
the
cows
necks
hopped
on
their
backs
a
dozen
maybe
on
each
cow
and
cracked
their
little
whips
the
cows
jumped
to
their
feet
and
themselves
galloped
off
colcheragh
ran
to
the
stable
got
on
a
horse
and
made
chase
after
his
cows
the
night
was
dark
but
he
could
hear
the
whizz
of
the
little
whips
through
the
air
the
click
of
the
cows
hoofs
on
stones
and
the
little
dogs
going
yep
yep
he
heard
too
the
laughing
of
themselves
then
one
of
them
would
be
singing
out
to
the
dogs
calling
them
up
by
name
giving
a
call
out
of
him
la
ho
la
la
colcheragh
followed
these
sounds
keeping
close
at
their
heels
on
and
on
they
went
over
hedges
and
over
ditches
till
they
got
to
the
fairy
hill
and
colcheragh
was
still
following
them
though
on
any
other
night
he
would
not
have
gone
within
a
mile
of
the
great
green
mound
when
the
little
fellows
came
to
the
hill
they
sounded
a
on
their
horns
the
hill
opened
bright
light
streamed
out
and
sounds
of
music
and
great
merriment
themselves
passed
through
and
colcheragh
slid
off
his
horse
and
slipped
unnoticed
in
after
them
the
hill
closed
behind
them
and
he
found
himself
in
a
fine
room
lit
up
till
it
was
brighter
than
the
summer
noonday
the
whole
place
was
crowded
with
little
people
young
and
old
men
and
women
all
decked
out
for
a
ball
that
grand
he
had
never
looked
on
the
like
among
them
were
some
faces
that
he
thought
he
had
seen
before
but
he
took
no
notice
of
them
nor
they
of
him
in
one
part
there
was
dancing
to
the
music
of
hom
mooar
that
was
the
name
of
the
fiddler
and
when
he
played
all
men
must
follow
him
whether
they
would
or
no
the
dancing
was
like
the
dancing
of
flowers
in
the
wind
such
dancing
as
he
had
never
seen
before
in
another
part
his
cows
were
being
killed
and
roasted
and
after
the
dance
there
was
a
great
feast
with
scores
of
tables
set
out
with
silver
and
gold
and
everything
of
the
best
to
eat
and
drink
there
was
roast
and
boiled
and
sollaghan
and
cowree
and
puddings
and
pies
and
jough
and
wine
a
feast
fit
for
the
governor
himself
when
they
were
taking
their
seats
one
of
them
whose
face
he
thought
he
knew
whispered
to
him
thee
taste
nothin
here
or
thou
will
be
like
me
and
never
go
back
to
thy
ones
no
more
colcheragh
made
up
his
mind
to
take
this
advice
when
the
feast
was
coming
to
an
end
there
was
a
shout
for
the
the
stirrup
cup
some
one
ran
to
fetch
the
cup
the
one
among
the
little
people
who
seemed
to
be
their
king
filled
it
with
red
wine
drank
himself
and
passed
it
on
to
the
rest
it
was
going
round
from
one
to
another
until
it
came
to
colcheragh
who
saw
when
he
had
it
in
his
hands
that
it
was
of
fine
carved
silver
and
more
beautiful
than
anything
ever
seen
outside
that
place
he
said
to
himself
little
durts
have
stolen
and
killed
and
eaten
my
cattle
this
cup
if
it
were
mine
would
pay
me
for
all
so
standing
up
and
grasping
the
silver
cup
tightly
in
his
hand
he
held
it
up
and
said
slaynt
which
is
the
manx
toast
then
he
dashed
the
cupful
of
wine
over
themselves
and
the
lights
in
an
instant
the
place
was
in
black
darkness
save
for
a
stime
of
grey
dawn
light
which
came
through
the
chink
of
the
door
colcheragh
made
for
it
cup
in
hand
slammed
the
door
behind
him
and
ran
for
his
life
after
a
moment
of
uproar
themselves
missed
the
cup
and
colcheragh
and
with
yells
of
rage
they
poured
out
of
the
hill
after
him
in
full
chase
the
farmer
who
had
a
good
start
ran
as
he
had
never
run
before
he
knew
he
would
get
small
mercy
at
their
hands
if
he
was
caught
he
went
splashing
through
the
wet
mire
and
keeping
off
the
stepping
stones
he
knew
they
could
not
take
him
in
the
water
he
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
mob
beg
behind
him
close
at
his
heels
waving
their
naked
arms
in
the
light
of
the
torch
each
one
held
up
on
they
came
shrieking
and
howling
in
manx
colcheragh
colcheragh
put
thy
foot
on
the
stone
and
do
not
put
it
in
the
wet
but
he
ran
in
the
water
till
he
came
to
the
churchyard
and
they
could
not
touch
him
there
when
he
went
into
the
cowhouse
the
next
morning
the
cows
had
all
come
home
and
they
got
rest
after
that
he
put
the
cup
in
the
church
at
rushen
and
they
are
saying
it
was
there
for
many
years
then
it
was
sent
to
london
it
is
said
that
after
this
the
farmer
would
not
go
out
of
his
house
of
an
evening
after
dark
the
child
without
a
name
it
was
many
and
many
a
year
ago
that
the
heiress
of
eary
cushlin
farm
had
a
little
child
eary
cushlin
is
a
terribly
lonely
place
it
stands
high
up
on
the
eanin
mooar
the
big
precipice
close
by
the
steep
brow
of
you
might
live
there
for
months
without
seeing
the
face
of
clay
and
no
person
knew
of
the
birth
of
the
child
it
was
not
welcome
when
it
came
and
as
soon
as
it
was
born
it
died
then
the
mother
carried
it
at
dead
of
night
along
the
narrow
path
over
the
rocks
past
where
the
waters
of
leap
into
the
bay
past
the
cave
of
the
goat
to
she
buried
it
in
the
ruins
of
the
lonely
little
keeill
that
has
been
there
on
the
for
fourteen
hundred
years
and
more
there
she
left
it
alone
a
short
while
after
some
yawls
were
going
to
the
haddock
fishing
from
dalby
there
was
the
granny
from
the
lagg
the
muck
beg
or
little
pig
from
cubbon
aalish
from
cleary
glen
rushen
and
others
ten
in
all
then
it
began
to
be
said
that
something
strange
was
going
on
over
at
the
men
would
be
fishing
close
in
to
land
under
the
black
shadow
of
the
hill
of
the
rising
day
when
little
evening
came
the
yawls
would
be
drifting
south
with
the
flood
tide
north
with
the
ebb
passing
and
repassing
the
strand
of
then
they
would
see
a
beautiful
light
and
hear
a
lamentation
and
crying
as
if
from
a
little
lost
child
in
the
end
the
light
would
run
up
the
steep
brow
to
the
old
keeill
and
go
out
the
men
got
so
frightened
that
at
last
they
would
not
go
on
the
bay
after
dark
but
would
make
from
the
as
soon
as
the
sun
was
getting
low
things
became
so
black
for
the
women
and
children
at
home
that
one
old
old
man
illiam
quirk
who
had
not
gone
to
sea
for
many
years
said
he
would
go
with
one
of
the
yawls
to
see
for
himself
they
used
to
say
of
him
illiam
has
the
power
at
him
in
the
prayer
and
he
is
a
middlin
despard
fella
he
will
dar
most
anything
it
was
so
at
this
time
his
yawl
was
the
last
of
them
coming
in
the
rest
were
frightened
it
was
a
right
fine
beautiful
moonlight
night
when
he
was
coming
down
from
the
mark
and
when
he
was
near
to
he
heard
crying
and
crying
he
lay
on
his
oars
and
listened
and
he
heard
a
little
child
wailing
over
and
over
again
lhiannoo
beg
dyn
ennym
mee
that
is
am
a
little
child
without
a
name
nearer
to
the
lan
said
illiam
when
he
heard
it
they
pulled
close
in
and
he
plainly
saw
a
little
child
on
the
strand
bearing
a
lighted
candle
in
his
hand
bless
me
bogh
we
mus
give
thee
a
name
said
illiam
and
he
took
off
his
hat
and
stood
up
in
the
boat
and
threw
a
handful
of
water
towards
the
child
crying
out
thou
are
a
boy
i
chrizzen
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
juan
if
thou
are
a
girl
i
chrizzen
thee
in
the
name
of
the
father
son
and
holy
ghost
joanney
in
an
instant
the
crying
stopped
and
was
never
heard
again
and
the
light
went
out
and
was
seen
no
more
the
fairy
doctor
the
shoemakers
and
tailors
and
chance
spinners
used
to
go
round
on
people
houses
making
things
and
spinning
rolls
of
wool
for
the
people
one
time
the
tailor
went
to
chalse
ballawhane
long
enough
they
were
waiting
for
him
and
as
luck
happened
he
caught
chalse
at
home
now
chalse
had
power
over
the
fishes
of
the
sea
and
the
birds
of
the
air
as
well
as
over
the
beasts
of
the
field
himself
and
the
little
ones
got
on
well
together
too
but
somehow
or
other
he
was
never
able
to
get
the
power
over
them
people
said
he
was
never
able
to
learn
their
language
right
anyhow
be
that
as
it
may
he
was
often
enough
with
them
after
the
tailor
had
had
a
crack
with
the
women
he
turned
round
to
ballawhane
who
was
sitting
in
the
big
chair
his
elbow
on
the
table
and
his
hand
holding
his
forehead
the
other
hand
in
his
pocket
to
the
elbow
and
he
not
minding
anybody
nor
anything
batter
take
yer
measure
teare
while
yer
in
for
there
no
knowin
how
long
that
be
the
tailor
said
boy
boy
answered
chalse
looking
out
through
the
window
people
were
not
bothering
with
blinds
then
and
then
turning
to
the
clock
he
said
no
time
goin
i
want
to
go
from
home
apiece
an
it
time
i
was
gettin
ready
nobody
said
a
word
for
a
minute
or
two
he
was
exactly
like
a
body
with
his
mind
far
away
again
all
of
a
sudden
he
looked
at
the
tailor
then
he
said
goin
to
a
big
supper

nothin
done

maybe
thou
would
like
to

apiece
to

thou
see
nor
what
thou
hear
nor
spake
to
thee
thou
must
spake
back
or
it
be
all
over
with
thee
the
tailor
was
so
taken
up
with
the
chance
of
seeing
the
little
people
for
himself
that
he
promised
faithfully
no
matter
what
took
place
never
to
speak
a
word
and
he
knew
he
would
be
right
enough
with
chalse
ballawhane
then
took
his
hat
from
the
latt
and
when
he
was
going
out
he
said
be
back
for
thee
just
now
side
thee
things
a
bit
while
thou
waitin
in
a
while
there
was
a
noise
of
horses
coming
up
the
street
it
was
awful
then
they
stopped
on
the
street
and
in
came
ballawhane
saying
couldn
get
another
hoss
for
thee
boy
do
what
we
would
but
thou
have
to
get
a
hoss
of
some
sort
and
going
down
to
the
parlour
he
got
hold
of
something
and
went
out
never
saying
a
word
coming
back
to
the
door
after
a
bit
he
said
on
boy
i
hold
her
head
till
thou
get
on
out
goes
the
tailor
and
up
with
one
whip
on
her
back
and
they
go
like
the
very
hommers
on
and
on
over
hedges
and
ditches
till
they
came
to
a
big
brow
by
a
river
it
seems
they
knew
the
way
night
as
it
was
for
they
all
took
it
one
after
another
like
fun
it
was
a
big
jump
though
and
when
the
tailor
felt
himself
flying
through
the
air
his
heart
jumped
to
his
mouth
lord
what
a
jump
he
said
the
next
minute
he
fell
flop
in
a
bog
with
the
lapboard
between
his
legs
all
alone
in
the
dark
next
morning
he
got
up
all
slaaed
with
slush
looking
like
a
thing
that
had
been
dragged
through
a
gutter
and
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
the
shy
he
was
every
bit
of
steam
took
out
of
him
awhile
after
some
of
the
women
were
asking
him
how
did
he
like
it
last
night
and
would
he
go
again
but
all
they
could
get
out
of
him
was
naver
no
more
naver
no
more
joe

the
buggane
this
finn

an
irish

she

the
buggane
he

he
thought
if
finn
was
that
strong
and
the
baby
that
big
he
had
best
catch
home
again
but
it
was
not
long
until
the
buggane
and
finn
did
meet
and
then
they
had
the
battle
one
day
finn
met
the
buggane
over
at
kirk
christ
rushen
and
they
went
at
each
other
early
in
the
day
till
the
sunset
finn
had
one
fut
in
the
big
sound
an
so
he
made
the
channel
between
the
calf
and
kitterland
and
the
other
in
the
little
sound
an
so
he
made
the
narrow
channel
between
kitterland
and
the
islan
the
buggane
was
standin
at
port
iern
that
what
made
the
fine
big
openin
at
port
iern
the
rocks
were
all
broken
to
pieces
with
their
feet
but
anyway
the
buggane
came
off
victorious
and
slashed
finn
awful
so
he
had
to
run
to
ireland
finn
could
walk
on
the
sea
but
the
buggane
couldn
and
when
finn
got
off
and
he
couldn
get
more
revenge
on
him
he
tore
out
a
tooth
and
hove
it
whizzing
through
the
air
after
finn
it
hit
him
on
the
back
of
the
head
and
then
it
fell
into
the
sea
and
became
what
we
are
now
calling
the
rock
finn
turned
round
with
a
roar
and
a
mighty
curse
seven
swearings
of
a
curse
on
it
says
he
it
lie
there
for
a
vexation
to
the
sons
of
men
while
water
runs
and
grass
grows
and
a
vexation
and
a
curse
has
it
been
to
seamen
from
that
day
to
this
the
fynoderee
the

to
the
meadow

and
the

was
stretching
himself
on
the
meadow
he
threw
the

on
the
left
hand

he
caused
us
to
wonder

there
was
one
time
a
fynoderee
living
in
gordon
those
persons
who
saw
him
said
that
he
was
big
and
shaggy
with
fiery
eyes
and
stronger
than
any
man
one
night
he
met
the
blacksmith
who
was
going
home
from
his
shop
and
held
out
his
hand
to
him
to
shake
hands
the
blacksmith
gave
him
hold
of
the
iron
sock
of
the
plough
which
he
had
with
him
and
he
squeezed
it
as
if
it
had
been
a
piece
of
clay
saying
some
strong
in
the
world
yet
the
fynoderee
did
all
his
work
at
night
and
went
into
hidlans
in
the
daytime
one
night
when
he
was
out
on
his
travels
he
came
to
mullin
sayle
out
in
glen
garragh
he
saw
a
light
in
the
mill
so
he
put
his
head
through
the
open
of
the
door
to
see
what
was
going
on
inside
and
there
was
quaye
mooar
wife
sifting
corn
when
she
caught
sight
of
the
great
big
head
she
was
frightened
terrible
she
had
presence
of
mind
however
to
hand
him
the
sieve
and
say
thou

to
the
river
and
bring

it
i
make
a
cake
for
thee
and
the
more
water

carry
back
that
the
bigger
thy
cake
will
be
so
the
fynoderee
took
the
sieve
and
ran
down
to
the
river
but
the
water
poured
from
it
and
he
could
fetch
none
for
the
cake
and
he
threw
the
sieve
away
in
a
rage
and
cried

going
out
the
woman
got
away
while
he
was
trying
to
fill
the
sieve
and
when
he
came
back
to
the
mill
he
found
it
in
darkness
the
fynoderee
was
working
very
hard
for
the
radcliffes
who
owned
gordon
then
every
night
he
was
grinding
their
corn
for
them
and
often
he
would
take
a
hand
at
the
flails
if
they
put
a
stack
into
the
barn
in
the
evening
and
loosed
every
sheaf
of
it
they
would
find
it
thrashed
in
the
morning
but
he
would
not
touch
one
sheaf
of
it
unless
it
were
loosed
in
the
summer
time
he
was
getting
in
their
hay
and
cutting
their
corn
many
a
time
the
people
of
the
farm
were
passing
the
time
of
day
with
him
one
cold
frosty
day
big
gordon
was
docking
turnips
and
he
blew
on
his
fingers
to
warm
them
are

for
said
the
fynoderee
put
them
in

boy
said
the
fynoderee
thou

and
blow
cold
with
one
breath
the
fynoderee
was
wearing
no
clothes
but
it
is
said
that
he
never
felt
the
cold
big
gordon
however
had
pity
on
him
that
he
had
none
and
one
frosty
winter
he
went
and
got
clothes

for
him

big

they
were
too

he
went
and
gave

one
night
the
fynoderee
looked
on
them
and
took
them
up
and
says
he

he
flung
the
clothes
away
and
walked
his
ways
to
glen
rushen
out
to
juan
mooar
cleary
he
was
working
for
him
then
cutting
the
meadow

and
seeing

sheep
it
happened
one
winter
night
that
there
was
a
great
juan

sheep
but
the
fynoderee

but
i
caught
her
for
all
when
juan
went
out
in
the
morning
all
the
sheep
were
safe
in
the
cogee
house
and
a
big
hare
in
with
them
with
two
short
lankets
on
him
that
was
the
brown
yearling
after
a
time
the
fynoderee
went
up
to
the
top
of
barrule
mountain
to
live
up
to
the
very
peak
himself
and
the
wife
went
to
make
a
potful
of
porridge
one
day
and
they
fell
out
she
ran
and
left
him
he
threw
a
big
white
rock
after
her
and
it
struck
her
on
the
heel
the
mark
of
the
blood
is
still
on
the
stone
at
cleigh
fainey
while
she
stooped
to
put
a
rag
on
her
heel
he
threw
a
lot
of
small
rocks
at
her
that
made
her
give
a
spring
to
the
lagg
two
miles
away
then
he
threw
a
big
rock
with
the
in
it
in
the
lagg
river
at
that
she
gave
two
leaps
over
the
sea
to
the
mountains
of
mourne
in
ireland
and
for
all
that
i
know
living
there
still
the
lhondoo
and
the
one
time
lhondoo
the
blackbird
was
living
in
the
mountains
and
the
bird
of
the
waste
as
manx
ones
call
the
golden
plover
was
living
in
the
lowlands
and
neither
of
them
was
able
to
leave
his
own
haunts
one
day
however
the
two
birds
met
on
the
borders
between
mountain
and
plain
and
they
made
it
up
between
them
that
they
would
change
places
for
a
while
the
bird
of
the
waste
should
stay
in
the
mountains
till
the
lhondoo
should
return
the
lhondoo
found
himself
better
off
in
his
new
home
than
in
the
old
one
and
he
did
not
go
back
so
the
poor
bird
of
the
waste
was
left
in
the
mountains
and
any
day
you
may
hear
him
cry
in
a
mournful
voice
vel

the

then
the
blackbird
goes
his
ways
billy
beg
tom
beg
and
the
fairies
not
far
from
dalby
billy
beg
and
tom
beg
two
humpback
cobblers
lived
together
on
a
lonely
croft
billy
beg
was
sharper
and
cleverer
than
tom
beg
who
was
always
at
his
command
one
day
billy
beg
gave
tom
a
staff
and
quoth
he
beg
go
to
the
mountain
and
fetch
home
the
white
sheep
tom
beg
took
the
staff
and
went
to
the
mountain
but
he
could
not
find
the
white
sheep
at
last
when
he
was
far
from
home
and
dusk
was
coming
on
he
began
to
think
that
he
had
best
go
back
the
night
was
fine
and
stars
and
a
small
crescent
moon
were
in
the
sky
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
curlew
sharp
whistle
tom
was
hastening
home
and
had
almost
reached
glen
rushen
when
a
grey
mist
gathered
and
he
lost
his
way
but
it
was
not
long
before
the
mist
cleared
and
tom
beg
found
himself
in
a
green
glen
such
as
he
had
never
seen
before
though
he
thought
he
knew
every
glen
within
five
miles
of
him
for
he
was
born
and
reared
in
the
neighbourhood
he
was
marvelling
and
wondering
where
he
could
be
when
he
heard
a
sound
drawing
nearer
to
him
said
he
to
himself
more
than
myself
afoot
on
the
mountains
i
have
company
the
sound
grew
louder
first
it
was
like
the
humming
of
bees
then
like
the
rushing
of
glen
meay
waterfall
and
last
it
was
like
the
marching
and
the
murmur
of
a
crowd
it
was
the
fairy
host
of
a
sudden
the
glen
was
full
of
fine
horses
and
of
little
people
riding
on
them
with
the
lights
on
their
red
caps
shining
like
the
stars
above
and
making
the
night
as
bright
as
day
there
was
the
blowing
of
horns
the
waving
of
flags
the
playing
of
music
and
the
barking
of
many
little
dogs
tom
beg
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
splendid
as
all
he
saw
there
in
the
midst
of
the
drilling
and
dancing
and
singing
one
of
them
spied
tom
and
then
tom
saw
coming
towards
him
the
grandest
little
man
he
had
ever
set
eyes
upon
dressed
in
gold
and
silver
and
silk
shining
like
a
raven
wing
is
a
bad
time
you
have
chosen
to
come
this
way
said
the
little
man
who
was
the
king
but
it
is
not
here
that
i
wishing
to
be
though
said
tom
then
said
the
king
you
one
of
us
tom
am
surely
said
tom
said
the
king
will
be
your
duty
to
take
the
password
you
must
stand
at
the
foot
of
the
glen
and
as
each
regiment
goes
by
you
must
take
the
password
it
is
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
do
that
with
a
heart
and
a
half
said
tom
at
daybreak
the
fiddlers
took
up
their
fiddles
the
fairy
army
set
itself
in
order
the
fiddlers
played
before
them
out
of
the
glen
and
sweet
that
music
was
each
regiment
gave
the
password
to
tom
as
it
went
by
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
and
last
of
all
came
the
king
and
he
too
gave
it
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
then
he
called
in
manx
to
one
of
his
men
the
hump
from
this
fellow
back
and
before
the
words
were
out
of
his
mouth
the
hump
was
whisked
off
tom
beg
back
and
thrown
into
the
hedge
how
proud
now
was
tom
who
so
found
himself
the
straightest
man
in
the
isle
of
mann
he
went
down
the
mountain
and
came
home
early
in
the
morning
with
light
heart
and
eager
step
billy
beg
wondered
greatly
when
he
saw
tom
beg
so
straight
and
strong
and
when
tom
beg
had
rested
and
refreshed
himself
he
told
his
story
how
he
had
met
the
fairies
who
came
every
night
to
glen
rushen
to
drill
the
next
night
billy
beg
set
off
along
the
mountain
road
and
came
at
last
to
the
green
glen
about
midnight
he
heard
the
trampling
of
horses
the
lashing
of
whips
the
barking
of
dogs
and
a
great
hullabaloo
and
behold
the
fairies
and
their
king
their
dogs
and
their
horses
all
at
drill
in
the
glen
as
tom
beg
had
said
when
they
saw
the
humpback
they
all
stopped
and
one
came
forward
and
very
crossly
asked
his
business
am
one
of
yourselves
for
the
night
and
should
be
glad
to
do
you
some
service
said
billy
beg
so
he
was
set
to
take
the
password
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
and
at
daybreak
the
king
said
time
for
us
to
be
off
and
up
came
regiment
after
regiment
giving
billy
beg
the
password
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
last
of
all
came
the
king
with
his
men
and
gave
the
password
also
monday
tuesday
wednesday
thursday
friday
saturday
sunday
says
billy
beg
thinking
himself
clever
then
there
was
a
great
outcry
the
hump
that
was
taken
off
that
fellow
back
last
night
and
put
it
on
this
man
back
said
the
king
with
flashing
eyes
pointing
to
the
hump
that
lay
under
the
hedge
before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
the
hump
was
clapt
on
to
billy
beg
back
said
the
king
off
and
if
ever
i
find
you
here
again
i
will
clap
another
hump
on
to
your
front
and
on
that
they
all
marched
away
with
one
great
shout
and
left
poor
billy
beg
standing
where
they
had
found
him
with
a
hump
growing
on
each
shoulder
and
he
came
home
next
day
dragging
one
foot
after
another
with
a
wizened
face
and
as
cross
as
two
sticks
with
his
two
humps
on
his
back
and
if
they
are
not
off
they
are
there
still
the
lazy
wife
well
there
was
a
woman
once
and
she
was
scandalous
lazy
she
was
that
lazy
she
would
do
nothing
but
sit
in
the
corner
of
the
chiollagh
warming
herself
or
going
on
the
houses
for
newses
the
day
long
and
one
day
her
man
gives
her
some
wool
to
spin
for
him
he
was
terrible
badly
off
for
clothes
to
wear
for
she
was
letting
them
get
all
ragged
on
him
he
had
told
her
to
mend
them
until
he
was
tired
but
all
he
could
get
out
of
her
was
dy
liooar
time
enough
one
day
he
comes
to
her
and
says
liggey
my
hraa
here
is
some
wool
for
thee
to
spin
and
if
it
is
not
done
a
month
from
this
day
i
throw
thee
out
on
the
side
of
the
road
thou
and
thy
traa
dy
liooar
have
left
me
nearly
bare
well
she
was
too
lazy
to
spin
but
she
would
be
pretending
to
be
working
hard
when
the
husband
was
in
the
house
she
used
to
put
the
wheel
out
on
the
floor
every
night
before
the
husband
came
in
from
work
to
let
on
to
him
that
she
had
been
spinning
the
husband
was
asking
her
was
the
thread
getting
near
spun
for
he
said
he
was
seeing
the
wheel
so
often
on
the
floor
that
he
wanted
to
know
if
she
had
enough
to
take
to
the
weaver
when
it
came
to
the
last
week
but
one
she
had
only
one
ball
spun
and
that
one
was
knotted
and
as
coarse
as
gorse
when
her
husband
says
to
her
seeing
the
wheel
middling
often
on
the
floor
when
i
come
home
at
night
maybe
there
enough
thread
spun
at
thee
now
for
me
to
take
to
the
weaver
next
week
do
know
at
all
says
the
wife
there
is
let
us
count
the
balls
then
the
play
began
up
she
went
on
the
lout
and
flung
the
ball
through
the
hole
down
to
him
count
thyself
and
fling
the
balls
back
again
to
me
says
she
to
the
man
and
as
fast
as
he
flung
the
ball
up
to
her
so
fast
she
flung
it
down
to
him
again
when
he
had
counted
the
ball
maybe
two
score
times
she
says
to
him
all
that
in
you
spun
well
woman
for
all
says
he
plenty
done
at
thee
for
the
weaver
aw
then
she
was
in
a
great
fix
and
did
know
in
her
senses
what
to
do
to
save
herself
she
knew
she
would
sup
sorrow
if
she
was
found
out
but
she
could
think
of
nothing
at
last
she
bethought
herself
of
the
giant
that
lived
in
a
lonesome
place
up
the
mountain
for
she
had
heard
tell
he
was
good
to
work
and
the
woman
she
says
to
herself
a
mind
to
go
my
ways
to
him
she
took
the
road
early
next
morning
she
and
her
rolls
of
wool
and
she
walked
up
hills
down
gills
till
at
last
she
came
to
the
giant
house
are
thou
wanting
here
says
the
giant
wanting
thee
to
help
me
says
she
and
she
up
and
told
him
about
the
ball
of
thread
and
everything
spin
the
wool
for
thee
says
the
giant
thou
tell
me
my
name
when
thou
come
for
the
balls
a
week
from
this
day
are
thou
satisfied
should
i
be
satisfied
says
the
woman
for
she
thought
to
herself
it
would
be
a
middling
queer
thing
if
she
could
find
out
his
name
within
a
week
well
the
woman
she
tried
every
way
to
find
out
the
giant
name
but
go
where
she
might
no
one
had
ever
heard
tell
of
it
the
time
was
getting
over
fast
and
she
was
no
nearer
to
the
giant
name
at
last
it
came
to
the
last
day
but
one
now
as
it
happened
the
husband
was
coming
home
from
the
mountain
that
day
in
the
little
evening
and
as
he
neared
the
giant
house
he
saw
it
all
in
a
blaze
of
light
and
there
was
a
great
whirling
and
whistling
coming
to
his
ears
and
along
with
it
came
singing
and
laughing
and
shouting
so
he
drew
near
the
window
and
then
he
sees
the
big
giant
inside
sitting
at
a
wheel
spinning
like
the
wind
and
his
hands
flying
with
the
thread
to
and
fro
to
and
fro
like
the
lightning
and
he
shouting
to
the
whistling
wheel
wheel
spin
faster
and
sing
wheel
sing
louder
and
he
sings
as
the
wheel
whirls
faster
and
faster

the
mermaid
of
gob
ny
ooyl
once
on
a
time
there
lived
at
the
bottom
end
of
cornah
gill
a
family
of
the
name
of
sayle
and
the
mermaid
who
had
her
haunt
up
bulgham
way
was
a
friend
to
them
they
were
always
in
luck
way
and
never
seemed
to
be
short
of
anything
sure
enough
they
were
full
of
thrift
and
to
fill
in
odds
of
spare
time
they
made
lobster
pots
from
the
osier
that
grew
around
in
plenty
and
they
always
found
a
ready
market
they
kept
a
cow
and
a
few
sheep
just
to
give
work
to
the
women
in
the
long
winter
nights
but
their
living
was
mostly
got
by
the
sea
it
was
well
known
that
sayle
had
a
strong
liking
for
apples
and
that
he
would
often
bring
some
with
him
out
in
the
boat
but
when
he
got
well
up
in
years
he
would
be
leaving
a
lot
of
the
for
the
boys
and
then
the
luck
began
to
get
less
and
many
a
time
one
of
them
had
to
take
a
gun
to
keep
something
in
the
pot
then
the
bigger
ones
took
to
the
herrings
one
evan
however
had
to
stay
about
to
keep
things
going
and
it
happened
that
one
day
after
he
had
the
creels
set
just
at
bulgham
that
he
pulled
the
boat
in
and
went
up
the
brow
after
eggs
on
coming
back
to
the
boat
he
heard
some
one
calling
to
him
and
looking
round
he
saw
a
woman
sitting
on
the
edge
of
a
rock
how
your
father
said
she
seldom
he
coming
this
way
now
young
sayle
was
a
bit
frightened
at
first
but
seeing
a
pleasant
look
on
her
face
he
took
courage
and
told
her
how
things
were
at
home
then
saying
she
hoped
to
see
him
again
she
slipped
into
the
water
and
disappeared
on
getting
home
he
told
what
had
taken
place
and
the
father
his
face
lighting
up
declared
will
be
luck
on
the
house
yet
and
he
said
some
apples
with
you
the
next
time
you
go
up
that
way
we
see
the
very
next
time
the
young
chap
went
he
took
some
apples
with
him
and
when
he
got
to
the
place
where
he
had
seen
the
beautiful
woman
he
went
as
usual
on
the
hunt
among
the
rocks
then
he
heard
sweet
singing
and
when
he
turned
round
what
should
he
see
but
the
mermaid
leaning
over
the
boat
and
smiling
pleasantly
she
took
an
apple
and
began
to
eat
and
chant
the
luck
o
the
sea
be
with
you
but
do
forgetful
be
of
bringing
some
sweet
lan
eggs
for
the
children
of
the
sea
from
that
time
he
was
nearly
living
on
the
water
until
at
last
he
was
taken
to
task
for
being
idle
then
he
made
up
his
mind
to
go
sailing
in
foreign
parts
the
mermaid
was
in
great
distress
so
to
please
her
he
went
and
planted
an
apple
tree
on
the
brow
above
her
haunt
telling
her
that
when
he
would
be
far
away
this
tree
would
grow
which
when
they
would
be
sweet
and
ready
for
eating
would
come
of
themselves
to
the
water
for
her
and
sure
enough
the
luck
of
the
family
remained
though
the
boy
was
gone
she
seemed
to
bear
up
well
for
a
long
time
and
would
often
be
seen
sitting
on
the
rocks
in
the
evening
singing
sad
songs
and
casting
longing
glances
up
to
the
apple
tree
above
she
kept
very
shy
of
everyone
coming
her
way
and
at
last
finding
the
apples
slow
in
coming
made
up
her
mind
to
go
in
search
of
young
sayle
hoping
the
apples
would
be
ready
for
taking
when
they
would
come
back
but
neither
of
them
ever
came
back
though
for
many
a
long
year
the
apple
tree
bore
fruit
and
marked
the
little
creek
where
the
mermaid
used
to
live
the
lost
wife
of
ballaleece
one
time
the
farmer
of
ballaleece
married
a
beautiful
young
wife
and
they
were
thinking
the
world
of
one
another
but
before
long
she
disappeared
some
persons
said
that
she
was
dead
and
others
that
she
was
taken
by
the
little
people
ballaleece
mourned
for
her
with
a
heavy
heart
and
looked
for
her
from
point
of
ayr
to
the
calf
but
in
the
end
not
finding
her
he
married
another
wife
this
one
was
not
beautiful
but
there
was
some
money
at
her
soon
after
the
marriage
his
first
wife
appeared
to
ballaleece
one
night
and
said
to
him

he
waited
in
the
dark

midnight

barn

opened
wide
sweet
music
was
heard
and
in
through
the
open
door

caps

horses

as
young

seized
hold
of
her
bridle
rein
but
he
was
shaken
from
side
to
side
like
a
leaf
on
a
tree
and
he
was
not
able
to
hold
her
as
she
went
out
through
the
door
she
stretched
out
her
right
hand
and
pointed

the
corner
of
the
barn

sad
voice

many

to
look
for
the

gone
astray
she
had
got
as
far
as

when
she
took
a
notion
that
she
heard
the
calves
over
the
river
in
johnny
baldoon
nuts
at
once
she
began
to
call
to
them
kebeg

so
loud
that
you
could
hear
her
at
chibber
pherick
patrick
well
the
people
could
hear
her
calling
quite
plainly
but
behold
a
great
mist
came
and
rolled
down
the
valley
and
shut
it
from
sight
the
people
on
one
side
of
the
valley
could
hear
her
voice
yet
calling
through
the
mist
kebeg
kebeg
then
came
a
little
sweet
voice
through
the
mist
and
the
trees
in
answer
here
kebeg
here
and
she
cried
comin
i
comin
and
that
was
all
the
fairies
who
live
in

pulled
her
in
and
carried
her
to

there
was
a
woman
named
colloo
in
close
ny
lheiy
near
glen
meay
and
she
had
a
child
that
had
fallen
sick
in
a
strange
way
nothing
seemed
wrong
with
him
yet
crosser
and
crosser
he
grew
nying
nyanging
night
and
day
the
woman
was
in
great
distress
charms
had
failed
and
she
did
know
rightly
what
to
do
it
seems
that
when
about
a
fortnight
old
the
child
as
fine
a
child
for
his
age
as
you
would
see
in
a
day
walk
was
left
asleep
while
the
mother
went
to
the
well
for
water
now
herself
forgot
to
put
the
tongs
on
the
cradle
and
when
she
came
back
the
child
was
crying
pitifully
and
there
was
no
quieting
for
him
and
from
that
very
hour
the
flesh
seemed
to
melt
off
his
bones
till
he
became
as
ugly
and
as
wizened
a
child
as
you
would
see
between
the
point
of
ayr
and
the
calf
he
was
that
way
his
whining
howl
filling
the
house
for
four
years
lying
in
his
cradle
without
a
motion
on
him
to
put
his
feet
under
him
not
a
day
rest
nor
a
night
sleep
had
the
woman
these
four
years
with
him
she
was
fairly
scourged
until
there
came
a
fine
day
in
the
spring
while
hom
beg
bridson
the
tailor
was
in
the
house
sewing
hom
is
dead
now
but
there
many
alive
that
remember
him
yet
he
was
wise
tremendous
for
he
was
going
from
house
to
house
sewing
and
gathering
wisdom
as
he
was
going
well
before
that
day
the
tailor
was
seeing
lots
of
wickedness
in
the
child
when
the
woman
would
be
out
feeding
the
cows
and
pigs
he
would
be
hoisting
his
head
up
out
of
the
cradle
and
making
faces
at
the
tailor
winking
and
slicking
and
shaking
his
head
and
saying
a
lad
i
am
that
day
the
woman
wanted
to
go
to
the
shop
to
sell
some
eggs
that
she
had
and

she
to
the
tailor

while

down
to
the
shop
when
she
was
gone
the
tailor
began
to
whistle
low
and
slow
to
himself
as
he
stitched
the
tune
of
a
little
hymn
that
hom
beg
said
a
little
harsh
voice
the
tailor
scandalised
looked
round
to
see
if
it
was
the
child
that
had
spoken
and
it
was
whush
now
lie
quate
said
the
tailor
rocking
the
cradle
with
his
foot
and
as
he
rocked
he
whistled
the
hymn
tune
louder
that
hom
beg

the
little

the
little
fella
covering
himself
up
in
the
clothes
till
nothing
was
left
of
him
to
be
seen
except
his
eyes
which
keeked
out
like
a
ferret
when

came
in
the
house
the
tailor
all
of
a
tremble
was
sitting
on
the
round
table
and
his
spec
on
his
nose
and
letting
on
that
he
was
busy

said
the
tailor
the
child
with
his
two
eyes
going
out
of
his
head
watching
to
see
what
the
tailor
was
going
to
do
was
slowly
turning
his
whining
howl
into
a
kind
of
call
to
his
own
sort
to
come
and
fetch
him
it
like
send
thee
home
said
the
tailor
drawing
near
the
cradle
and
he
stretches
out
his
two
hands
to
take
the
child
and
put
him
on
the
big
red
turf
fire
before
he
was
able
to
lay
a
hand
on
him
the
little
fella
leaped
out
of

cradle
and

said
he
i
would
only
another
night

could
have

trick
or
two
more
than
that
yet
then
the
door
flew
open
with
a
bang
as
though
some
one
had
thrown
it
open
and
he
took
off
with
himself
like
a
shot
a
hullabaloo
of
laughing
and
making
fun
was
heard
outside
and
the
noise
of
many
running
little
feet
out
of
the
door
of
the
house
goes
herself
and
hom
after
her
they
see
no
one
but
they
caught
sight
of
a
flock
of
clouds
shaped
like
gulls
chasing
each
other
away
up
glen
rushen
and
then
came
to
their
ears
as
if
afar
off
from
the
clouds
sharp
whistles
and
wicked
little
laughs
as
if
making
mock
of
them
then
as
they
were
turning
round
to
come
back
she
suddenly
sees
right
before
her
her
own
sweet
rosy
smiling
child
with
thumb
in
mouth
lying
on
a
mossy
bank
and
she
took
all
the
joy
in
the
world
of
the
child
that
he
was
back
again
safe
and
sound
the
little
footprints
close
to
the
niarbyl
the
great
tail
of
rock
that
stretches
into
the
sea
at
dalby
is
a
little
house
on
the
strand
it
is
sheltered
behind
by
the
high
rock
which
rises
above
its
thatched
roof
before
it
lies
bay
mooar
the
great
bay
held
by
a
chain
of
mountains
purple
with
ling
standing
before
its
door
and
looking
to
the
west
you
may
see
the
sun
set
behind
the
distant
mourne
mountains
at
dawn
you
may
see
him
rise
over
the
hill
of
the
rising
day
here
lived
juan
the
fisherman
he
knew
as
well
as
any
person
that
the
little
people
were
all
around
when
he
was
a
boy
he
had
many
a
time
looked
out
of
the
door
on
moonlight
nights
to
try
if
he
could
put
sight
on
them
dancing
on
the
lonely
shore
he
had
not
seen
them
they
make
themselves
invisible
when
they
know
that
mortal
eyes
are
on
them
but
he
had
seen
the
tiny
riding
lights
of
their
herring
fleet
in
the
bay
and
had
helped
his
father
to
draw
in
the
nets
full
of
good
fish
which
were
sure
to
be
caught
the
night
after
many
a
time
he
had
wakened
from
his
sleep
in
the
dark
and
in
the
pauses
of
the
wind
and
the
lull
of
the
great
breakers
he
had
heard
the
sound
of
hammering
he
knew
it
was
the
little
people
hammering
at
their
herring
barrels
in
the
coopers
cave
under
the
hills
and
that
as
the
chips
flew
out
on
to
the
waves
they
became
ships
he
had
heard
the
story
of
the
fisherman
a
friend
of
his
father
who
was
fishing
one
night
at
when
a
dense
grey
mist
rolled
in
he
thought
he
had
best
make
for
home
while
the
footpath
above
the
rocks
was
visible
when
he
was
getting
his
things
together
he
heard
what
sounded
like
a
lot
of
children
coming
out
of
school
he
lifted
his
head
and
behold
there
was
a
fleet
of
fairy
boats
each
side
of
the
rock
their
riding
lights
shining
like
little
stars
on
a
frosty
night
the
crews
seemed
busy
preparing
to
come
on
shore
and
he
heard
one
little
fellow
shout

poor

enough
at
the
people
of
this
world
nothing

said
the
fisherman
dropped
off
and
went
agate
the
flitters
when
juan
was
a
big
boy
he
himself
saw
a
thing
which
he
never
forgot
one
day
he
left
a
boat
over
at
the
farther
side
of
bay
mooar
and
at
night
he
had
to
go
over
to
fetch
it
it
was
a
moonlight
night
and
the
bay
was
as
smooth
as
glass
as
he
rowed
across
there
was
no
sound
but
the
lapping
of
the
little
waves
on
the
shore
and
now
and
again
the
cry
of
a
gannet
juan
found
his
boat
on
the
strand
where
he
had
left
her
and
was
setting
to
work
to
launch
her
when
he
thought
he
saw
a
glimmering
light
which
was
not
the
light
of
the
moon
in
one
of
the
caves
near
him
he
stood
where
he
was
and
listened
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
faint
music
then
he
went
as
silently
as
he
was
able
to
the
cave
and
looked
in
no
light
was
there
but
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
the
shadows
in
the
corners
of
the
cave
were
as
black
as
pitch
juan
was
trembling
all
over
and
at
first
he
was
blinking
his
eyes
and
could
see
nothing
but
after
some
minutes
he
saw
a
great
stone
in
the
midst
of
the
cave
and
the
floor
of
fine
white
sand
and
on
the
sand
around
that
stone
there
were
little
footprints
marks
of
tiny
clogs
they
were
no
bigger
than
his
thumb
the
tall
man
of
ballacurry
tom
craine
was
going
home
at
midnight
from
bradda
mine
to
his
home
at
colby
the
road
was
lonely
and
he
met
no
person
but
the
full
moon
was
shining
and
it
was
as
light
as
day
as
he
began
to
pass
under
the
trees
that
grow
round
the
house
at
ballacurry
a
little
dog
appeared
suddenly
from
the
black
shadow
at
the
roadside
and
followed
at
his
heels
he
whistled
to
it
but
as
he
turned
his
head
to
look
at
it
it
ran
on
in
front
of
him
and
for
a
minute
he
did
not
see
it
when
he
came
in
sight
of
it
again
he
was
terrified
to
see
that
it
had
grown
larger
as
big
as
a
goat
and
it
grew
bigger
and
bigger
till
it
was
the
size
of
a
donkey
it
galloped
before
him
and
disappeared
round
the
bend
of
the
road
where
the
gate
of
ballacurry
is
when
tom
came
to
the
gate
he
saw
a
very
tall
thin
man
leaning
on
it
with
his
arms
folded
on
the
top
of
it
the
beast
was
not
there
as
tom
reached
the
gate
the
tall
thin
man
turned
and
walked
up
the
long
path
that
leads
to
the
house
when
he
got
to
the
door
he
turned
again
and
walked
back
down
the
path
towards
tom
by
the
bright
moonlight
tom
saw
the
lace
ruffle
round
his
neck
the
satin
of
his
knee
breeches
the
silk
of
his
stockings
and
the
shining
buckles
on
his
shoes
the
dress
of
bygone
days
his
face
was
white
and
dreadful
as
tom
looked
he
was
all
at
once
taken
with
terror
and
ran
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
down
the
road
to
colby
he
had
not
gone
far
when
he
met
two
of
his
friends
ben
mylechreest
and
bill
teare
he
told
them
what
he
had
seen
and
they
made
fun
of
him
and
would
not
believe
that
he
had
seen
any
such
thing
they
said
they
would
go
back
with
him
to
the
gate
so
they
all
three
turned
back
when
they
got
to
the
gate
they
saw
the
big
man
as
tall
as
two
men
walking
up
the
path
with
his
back
towards
them
as
before
when
he
reached
the
door
he
turned
what
they
saw
they
never
told
any
man
they
took
to
their
heels
all
three
and
ran
till
they
could
run
no
longer
they
were
trembling
from
head
to
foot
and
the
sweat
pouring
from
them
they
were
too
terrified
to
go
home
so
they
turned
in
with
tom
and
they
slept
all
three
in
one
bed

quayle
story
of
the
fairy
pig
when
i
was
a
little
boy
we
lived
over
by
sloc
one
day
when
i
was
six
years
old
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
went
up
the
mountain
to
make
hay
and
i
was
left
by
myself
it
was
getting
rather
late
and
they
had
not
come
back
so
i
was
frightened
and
started
off
up
the
mountain
to
try
and
find
them
i
had
not
gone
far
when
i
saw
running
before
me
a
little
pig
at
first
i
thought
it
was
some
neighbour
pig
and
i
tried
to
catch
it
but
it
ran
from
me
and
i
ran
after
it
as
it
went
i
saw
that
it
was
not
like
an
ordinary
pig
its
tail
was
feathery
and
spread
out
like
a
fan
and
it
had
long
lapping
ears
that
swept
the
ling
now
and
again
it
turned
its
head
and
looked
at
me
and
its
eyes
were
burning
like
fire
we
went
higher
and
higher
up
the
mountain
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
at
the
edge
of
a
steep
brow
and
was
all
but
over
i
turned
just
in
time
and
ran
as
hard
as
i
could
go
down
the
mountain
and
the
pig
after
me
when
i
looked
back
over
my
shoulder
i
saw
that
it
was
jumping
over
the
big
stones
and
rocks
on
the
mountain
side
as
if
they
had
been
butts
of
ling
i
thought
it
would
catch
me
it
was
close
behind
me
when
i
ran
in
at
our
garden
gate
but
i
was
just
in
time
and
i
slammed
the
door
upon
it
i
told
my
mother
and
my
grandmother
what
had
happened
and
my
grandmother
said
it
was
a
fairy
pig
i
was
not
like
myself
that
night
i
could
not
eat
any
supper
and
i
went
soon
to
my
bed
i
could
not
sleep
but
lay
tossing
about
and
was
burning
hot
after
a
time
my
mother
opened
the
door
to
see
if
i
was
asleep
and
when
she
looked
at
me
her
eyes
were
like
the
pig
eyes
i
felt
a
sharp
pain
go
through
my
right
leg
like
a
stab
after
that
the
pain
never
left
me
it
was
so
bad
that
i
could
not
bear
to
be
touched
and
i
could
eat
nothing
i
grew
worse
and
worse
and
after
some
days
my
father
said
he
would
take
me
to
a
charmer
at
castletown
they
lifted
me
in
the
sheet
four
men
taking
the
four
corners
and
carried
me
to
a
cart
never
will
i
forget
the
shaking
and
jolting
i
had
in
that
cart
when
we
got
to
castletown
i
was
more
dead
than
alive
the
charmer
lived
in
arbory
street
and
they
took
me
to
his
house
when
he
saw
me
he
said
that
they
must
all
go
away
and
leave
me
alone
with
him
so
my
father
and
my
mother
went
to
wait
for
me
at
the
george
the
charmer
carried
me
to
a
room
upstairs
and
sent
his
wife
away
and
laid
me
on
the
floor
and
locked
the
door
then
he
took
down
a
big
book
and
placed
it
on
the
floor
beside
me
he
opened
it
at
the
picture
of
a
little
plant
i
can
see
the
plant
to
this
day
and
he
pointed
with
his
left
hand
to
the
picture
and
with
his
right
hand
he
made
the
sign
of
the
cross
on
my
leg
where
the
stab
went
through
me
and
said

set
me
at
a
table
and
gave
me

kitterland
it
was
more
than
eight
hundred
years
ago
in
the
days
of
olaf
goddardson
that
baron
kitter
the
norwegian
lived
in
mann
he
had
his
castle
on
the
top
of
barrule
and
he
spent
all
his
time
in
hunting
the
bisons
and
elks
that
were
on
the
island
then
until
he
had
killed
them
all
then
the
people
began
to
be
afraid
that
he
would
chase
their
cattle
and
the
purrs
of
the
mountains
and
leave
them
no
beasts
at
all
so
they
went
to
the
wisest
witches
of
the
island
to
see
what
they
could
do
one
day
baron
kitter
had
gone
over
to
the
calf
to
hunt
the
red
deer
there
leaving
his
cook
eaoch
of
the
loud
voice
in
the
castle
to
cook
his
dinner
eaoch
set
the
pot
on
the
fire
and
then
fell
asleep
over
his
work
while
he
was
sleeping
the
ada
put
a
spell
on
the
pot
and
the
fat
boiled
over
into
the
fire
soon
the
house
was
in
flames
eaoch
woke
and
shouted
for
help
at
the
top
of
his
voice
and
his
cries
were
so
loud
that
they
reached
the
ears
of
kitter
and
his
ten
miles
away
on
the
calf
when
kitter
heard
the
cries
and
saw
the
flames
on
the
top
of
barrule
he
made
for
the
beach
as
hard
as
he
could
and
put
out
in
a
small
currach
for
the
island
with
most
of
his
friends
when
they
were
in
the
strong
current
about
half
way
across
the
channel
the
boat
struck
on
a
rock
and
they
were
all
drowned
and
the
rock
has
ever
since
been
called
kitterland
the
rest
of
kitter
friends
who
had
stayed
on
the
calf
and
so
saved
their
lives
believed
that
eaoch
the
cook
had
made
a
plot
with
the
witches
of
the
island
to
do
away
with
all
the
norwegians
in
mann
so
they
brought
him
before
king
olaf
to
be
judged
and
he
was
condemned
to
death
but
according
to
the
custom
of
norway
he
was
allowed
to
choose
how
he
would
die
then
he
said
wish
my
head
to
be
laid
across
one
of
your
majesty
legs
and
there
cut
off
by
your
majesty
sword
macabuin
which
was
made
by
loan
maclibuin
the
dark
smith
of
drontheim
it
was
known
to
every
person
there
that
the
king
sword
could
cut
the
hardest
granite
only
by
touching
it
with
its
edge
and
they
all
begged
olaf
not
to
do
as
crafty
eaoch
asked
but
the
king
would
not
break
his
word
and
gave
orders
that
all
should
be
done
as
the
cook
had
said
but
the
witch
ada
was
there
and
she
told
them
to
take
toads
skins
twigs
of
the
cuirn
tree
and
adders
eggs
nine
times
nine
of
each
and
put
them
between
the
king
leg
and
the
cook
head
they
did
this
and
then
the
great
sword
macabuin
made
by
loan
maclibuin
was
lifted
with
the
greatest
care
by
one
of
the
king
faithful
servants
and
laid
gently
on
the
cook
neck
but
before
it
could
be
stopped
head
was
cut
from
his
body
and
the
adders
eggs
and
the
cuirn
twigs
were
also
cut
through
only
the
toads
skins
saved
the
king
leg
when
the
dark
smith
heard
how
the
power
of
the
great
sword
macabuin
had
been
stayed
by
witchcraft
he
was
very
angry
and
called
for
his
who
had
lost
one
leg
when
he
was
helping
to
make
the
sword
he
sent
him
off
at
once
to
peel
castle
to
challenge
king
olaf
or
any
of
his
men
to
a
walking
race
from
peel
to
drontheim
king
olaf
himself
took
up
the
challenge
and
off
they
set
over
mountains
and
through
gills
they
walked
as
fast
as
they
could
go
and
the
man
as
fast
as
the
king
when
they
had
crossed
the
island
they
each
put
out
to
sea
in
a
sailing
boat
and
each
came
in
sight
of
drontheim
at
the
same
moment
when
they
drew
near
to
the
smithy
the
who
was
ahead
called
out
to
loan
to
open
the
door
and
olaf
called
to
him
to
shut
it
and
then
pushing
past
hiallus
got
into
the
smithy
first
to
show
that
he
was
not
at
all
weary
after
his
walk
olaf
took
up
the
great
hammer
of
the
forge
and
struck
the
anvil
such
a
mighty
blow
that
he
split
it
through
and
the
block
beneath
it
too
when
emergaid
the
daughter
of
loan
saw
the
strength
and
power
of
olaf
she
loved
him
and
while
her
father
was
putting
back
the
block
and
anvil
she
whispered
to
the
king
father
is
doing
that
so
that
he
may
finish
the
sword
he
is
making
it
has
been
foretold
that
the
first
blood
it
shall
shed
shall
be
royal
blood
and
he
has
sworn
that
that
blood
shall
be
yours
is
not
your
father
the
seventh
son
of
old
windy
cap
king
of
norway
cried
olaf
is
said
emergaid
the
prophecy
shall
be
fulfilled
said
olaf
and
he
thrust
the
sword
into
the
heart
of
loan
and
afterwards
slew
with
it
the
also
he
made
emergaid
his
queen
and
they
ruled
together
and
from
them
came
a
long
line
of
kings
of
mann
teeval
princess
of
the
ocean
in
the
old
days
culain
the
smith
of
the
gods
was
living
in
the
isle
of
mann
it
was
the
time
when
conchubar
was
at
the
court
of
the
king
of
ulster
and
had
nothing
but
the
sword
in
his
hand
he
was
a
fine
handsome
young
man
and
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
make
himself
a
king
so
he
went
one
day
to
the
druid
of
clogher
to
ask
him
what
he
had
best
do
thy
way
said
the
druid
the
isle
of
mann
there
thou
wilt
find
the
great
smith
culain
get
him
to
make
thee
a
sword
and
a
spear
and
a
shield
and
with
these
thou
shalt
win
the
kingdom
of
ulster
conchubar
went
away
and
hired
a
boat
and
put
out
to
sea
he
landed
in
mann
and
made
straight
for
culain
smithy
it
was
night
when
he
got
there
and
the
red
glow
of
the
furnace
shone
out
into
the
dark
he
could
hear
from
inside
the
smithy
the
roar
of
the
bellows
and
the
clanging
of
the
hammer
on
the
anvil
when
he
came
near
a
great
dog
as
large
as
a
calf
began
to
bay
and
to
growl
like
thunder
and
brought
his
master
out
art
thou
young
man
said
he
culain
cried
conchubar
is
from
the
druid
of
clogher
that
i
come
and
he
bade
me
ask
thee
to
make
me
a
sword
and
a
spear
and
a
shield
for
only
with
weapons
of
thy
making
can
i
win
the
kingdom
of
ulster
culain
face
grew
black
at
first
but
after
he
had
gazed
for
a
while
at
conchubar
he
saw
that
he
had
the
look
about
him
of
one
who
would
go
far
and
he
said
shall
be
done
for
thee
but
thou
must
wait
for
the
work
is
long
so
culain
began
to
make
the
weapons
and
conchubar
waited
in
the
island
early
one
brave
morning
in
may
when
the
sun
had
just
risen
over
he
was
walking
on
the
strand
wondering
to
himself
how
much
longer
culain
would
be
making
his
weapons
and
thinking
it
was
full
time
for
him
to
return
the
tide
was
going
out
and
the
sun
was
shining
on
the
wet
sand
suddenly
he
saw
something
flashing
at
the
edge
of
the
waves
a
few
paces
from
him
he
ran
up
to
it
and
behold
it
was
the
most
beautiful
woman
he
had
ever
put
sight
on
fast
asleep
her
hair
was
golden
like
the
gorse
in
bloom
her
skin
whiter
than
the
foam
of
the
sea
her
lips
red
as
the
coral
and
her
cheeks
rosy
like
the
little
clouds
that
were
flying
before
the
face
of
the
rising
sun
the
fringe
of
her
dress
of
many
coloured
seaweeds
rose
and
fell
with
the
ebb
and
flow
of
the
waves
pearls
gleamed
on
her
neck
and
arms
conchubar
stood
and
looked
on
her
he
knew
that
she
was
a
mermaid
and
that
as
soon
as
she
awoke
she
would
slip
back
into
the
ocean
and
be
lost
to
him
so
he
bound
her
fast
with
his
girdle
then
she
awoke
and
opened
her
eyes
which
were
blue
as
the
sea
and
when
she
saw
that
she
was
bound
she
cried
out
with
terror
me
man
loose
me
conchubar
did
not
answer
so
she
said
again
me
i
beg
thee
in
a
voice
as
sweet
as
the
music
of
hom
mooar
the
fairy
fiddler
by
this
time
conchubar
was
feeling
that
he
would
give
all
he
had
to
keep
her
he
answered
trembling
my
heart
who
art
thou
am
teeval
princess
of
the
ocean
said
she
me
free
i
pray
thee
if
i
set
thee
free
said
conchubar
wilt
leave
me
can
not
stay
with
thee
conchubar
she
cried
me
free
and
i
will
give
thee
a
precious
gift
will
loose
thee
answered
conchubar
is
not
for
the
gift
but
because
i
can
not
resist
thee
he
unfastened
the
girdle
from
her
and
she
said
gift
to
thee
is
this
go
now
to
culain
who
is
making
thy
shield
and
tell
him
that
teeval
princess
of
the
ocean
bids
him
to
put
her
figure
on
the
shield
and
round
it
to
grave
her
name
then
thou
shalt
wear
it
always
in
battle
and
when
thou
shalt
look
on
my
face
and
call
my
name
thy
enemies
strength
shall
go
from
them
and
shall
come
into
thee
and
thy
men
when
she
had
said
this
she
waved
her
white
arm
to
conchubar
and
plunged
into
the
waves
he
looked
sadly
for
a
long
time
at
the
spot
where
she
had
disappeared
and
then
walked
slowly
to
the
forge
of
culain
and
gave
him
the
message
culain
finished
the
mighty
shield
as
the
princess
had
said
and
forged
also
for
conchubar
a
magic
sword
and
a
spear
set
with
precious
stones
then
conchubar
in
his
crimson
mantle
and
white
tunic
and
armed
with
his
great
shield
and
his
mighty
weapons
went
back
to
ireland
all
that
the
princess
of
the
ocean
had
said
came
true
when
he
went
into
battle
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
face
in
his
shield
and
cried
teeval
then
he
felt
strength
come
into
him
like
the
strength
of
a
giant
and
he
cut
his
enemies
down
like
grass
before
long
he
was
famous
all
over
ireland
for
his
great
deeds
and
in
the
end
he
became
king
of
ulster
then
he
invited
culain
to
come
and
live
in
his
kingdom
and
gave
him
the
plain
of
murthemny
to
dwell
in
but
he
never
again
saw
the
lovely
mermaid
the
wizard
palace
long
hundreds
of
years
ago
there
was
a
fine
palace
on
a
mountain
sloping
up
from
the
sea
it
was
like
a
palace
in
a
dream
built
of
shining
marble
of
all
colours
and
having
great
doors
covered
with
gold
in
it
there
lived
the
mighty
wizard
who
had
made
it
for
himself
by
his
spells
but
his
hatred
of
other
people
was
as
great
as
his
power
and
he
would
not
allow
any
person
to
come
near
him
except
his
own
servants
and
they
were
evil
spirits
if
any
man
dared
to
go
to
see
the
palace
to
ask
for
work
or
to
beg
for
charity
he
would
never
be
heard
of
again
his
friends
might
search
for
him
but
they
would
never
find
him
soon
people
began
to
whisper
that
some
of
the
blocks
of
granite
near
the
palace
were
like
the
men
who
had
gone
up
the
mountain
and
never
came
back
they
began
to
believe
that
the
wizard
had
caught
them
and
frozen
them
into
grey
stone
at
length
the
wizard
became
the
terror
of
the
whole
island
so
that
no
person
would
pass
within
several
miles
of
his
palace
the
people
of
that
side
of
the
island
fled
from
their
homes
and
the
place
was
lonely
and
desolate
so
things
went
on
for
three
years
until
one
day
a
poor
man
going
on
the
houses
happened
to
travel
on
that
side
of
the
island
not
knowing
anything
of
this
wizard
his
road
took
him
over
the
mountain
where
the
wizard
lived
and
as
he
came
near
it
he
was
astonished
to
see
the
place
so
silent
and
desolate
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
the
usual
food
and
shelter
with
the
friendly
welcome
but
he
found
the
houses
empty
ruins
and
the
kindly
country
people
gone
and
where
was
the
straw
and
hay
which
made
such
a
snug
bed
in
the
barn
weeds
and
stones
were
lying
thick
in
the
fields
night
came
on
him
and
he
walked
and
walked
but
never
a
bit
of
shelter
could
he
find
and
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
to
get
a
bed
a
middlin
dark
night
he
thought
it
better
to
go
on
than
back
a
road
a
body
is
used
on
is
no
throuble
to
them
let
it
be
night
or
not
he
was
travelling
on
the
old
road
over
the
mountain
going
ahead
singing
raby
for
company
to
himself
and
after
a
long
while
he
saw
a
light
in
the
distance
the
light
got
brighter
and
brighter
until
he
came
to
a
grand
palace
with
every
window
lit
up
the
singing
was
all
knocked
out
of
him
the
name
of
fortune
where
am
i
at
all
this
is
a
dreadful
big
house
he
said
to
himself
did
it
come
from
for
all
nobody
never
seen
the
like
of
it
on
this
bare
breas
before
else
where
am
i
at
all
at
all
he
was
hard
set
to
get
to
the
door
with
the
blocks
of
stone
lying
about
like
frozen
men
swear
he
said
to
himself
as
he
stumbled
over
one
this
was
lil
neddy
hom
the
dwarf
man
tha
missin
only
it
stone
when
he
came
to
the
big
door
it
was
locked
through
one
of
the
windows
he
saw
a
table
and
supper
ready
on
it
but
he
saw
no
person
he
was
very
tired
and
hungry
but
he
was
afraid
to
knock
at
the
door
of
such
a
fine
place
that
place
is
too
gran
for
the
likes
of
me
said
he
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
marble
seats
outside
saying
stretch
meself
here
till
mornin
it
a
middlin
sort
of
a
night
that
day
meat
and
bread
had
been
given
to
him
at
the
last
town
he
had
passed
through
he
was
hungry
and
he
thought
he
would
eat
so
he
opened
his
wallet
and
took
out
a
piece
of
bread
and
meat
then
he
put
his
hand
into
his
pocket
and
drew
out
a
pinch
of
salt
in
a
screw
of
paper
as
he
opened
the
paper
some
grains
of
salt
fell
out
on
to
the
ground
no
sooner
had
this
happened
than
up
from
the
ground
beneath
came
the
sound
of
most
terrible
groans
high
winds
blew
from
every
airt
out
of
the
heavens
lightnings
flashed
in
the
air
dreadful
thunder
crashed
overhead
and
the
ground
heaved
beneath
his
feet
and
he
knew
that
there
was
plenty
of
company
round
him
though
no
man
was
to
be
seen
in
less
than
a
moment
the
grand
palace
burst
into
a
hundred
thousand
bits
and
vanished
into
the
air
he
found
himself
on
a
wide
lonely
mountain
and
in
the
grey
light
of
dawn
no
trace
of
the
palace
was
to
be
seen
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
put
up
a
prayer
of
thanksgiving
for
his
escape
and
then
ran
on
to
the
next
village
where
he
told
the
people
all
that
he
had
seen
and
glad
they
were
to
hear
of
the
disappearance
of
the
wizard
the
enchanted
isle
out
under
the
irish
sea
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
of
the
calf
there
is
an
enchanted
isle
long
long
ago
it
was
on
the
surface
of
the
water
that
was
in
the
days
when
manannan
ruled
in
mann
but
when
saint
patrick
drove
manannan
and
his
men
from
the
island
in
the
form
of
creatures
they
came
upon
this
isle
manannan
dropped
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
they
were
seen
no
more
now
it
is
the
home
of
manannan
mac
y
leirr
son
of
the
sea
and
he
rules
it
as
he
used
to
rule
mann
but
once
in
seven
years
when
old
may
day
is
on
a
sunday
the
isle
may
be
seen
it
rises
up
from
the
sea
just
before
sunrise
like
a
beautiful
vision
and
manannan
looks
once
more
at
ellan
vannin
the
hills
of
the
enchanted
isle
are
green
white
foam
rings
it
round
and
if
you
are
near
enough
you
may
see
the
tossing
arms
and
golden
hair
of
the
mermaids
by
the
edge
washing
their
glittering
jewels
and
hear
the
singing
of
birds
and
smell
the
fragrant
scent
of
flowers
but
as
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
rest
upon
its
highest
hills
it
sinks
into
the
deep

robin
said
iii
how
the
wren
became
king
of
the
birds
a
long
long
time
ago
before
you
and
i
were
born
the
birds
of
the
air
gathered
at
tynwald
from
all
airts
of
the
wind
the
meeting
was
to
settle
once
and
for
all
the
squabbling
and
fighting
among
them
as
to
which
of
them
was
the
cleverest
and
it
was
agreed
that
the
cleverest
bird
should
be
king
the
sky
was
black
with
them
big
and
little
and
soon
all
had
gathered
together
everywhere
groups
of
birds
cooishing
scolding
or
sleeping
some
were
in
fine
black
sunday
coats
like
old
parson
gull
some
clad
only
in
brown
like
poor
brownie
the
hedge
sparrow
but
most
wore
leggings
of
red
or
yellow
while
the
chough
had
a
new
pair
of
bright
red
ones
yellow
tommy
the
dandy
was
preening
himself
swinging
on
the
top
of
a
gorse
bush
old
greyback
the
crow
perched
on
a
rock
above
him
silent
but
observant
was
eating
flitters
and
over
all
the
blue
arch
of
the
sky
in
which
hung
motionless
a
eagle
the
corncrake
officially
announced
raip
ready
ready
then
each
one
got
up
in
his
turn
to
tell
of
all
the
great
things
he
could
do
the
falcon
boasted
that
he
and
his
mate
were
worth
the
kingdom
of
mann
with
all
its
rights
lhondoo
the
thrush
sang
her
best
to
them
it
was
a
pleasure
to
listen
to
her
and
for
a
moment
she
thought
that
she
would
be
elected
flame
of
the
wood
the
goldfinch
spread
her
bright
plumage
fork
of
the
wind
the
swallow
told
of
her
swiftness
and
travels
to
warm
countries
in
the
south
the
curlew
of
her
riches
the
curlew
be
poor
or
fat
she
carries
a
groat
upon
her
back
said
she
showing
the
mark
of
which
she
bears
when
the
cuckoo
got
up
the
meadow
pipit
darted
out
from
a
group
and
danced
round
calling
out
his
name
to
draw
attention
to
himself
the
little
fool
and
saying
every
bird
hatch
her
own
eggs
so
poor
cuckoo
was
heard
there
was
a
dispute
between
the
magpie
and
the
jackdaw
as
to
which
was
the
best
thief
at
last
little
jinny
wren
got
up
to
have
her
say
after
all
the
grand
ones
had
done
ha
ha
laughed
the
snipe
and
all
the
birds
chuckled
but
jinny
wren
got
the
better
of
them
for
all
that
says
she
small
though
i
am
and
slender
my
leg
twelve
chicks
i
can
bring
out
of
the
egg
and
the
birds
agreed
that
jinny
was
as
clever
again
as
the
best
of
them
but
the
eagle
did
like
it
that
a
little
bit
of
a
bird
like
jinny
wren
should
be
over
him
so
he
considered
for
a
minute
and
says
he
middling
vexed
it
only
right
that
the
best
bird
on
the
wing
should
be
king
let
try
a
heat
to
see
which
of
us
can
go
the
highest
hullad
the
owl
looked
thoughtful
and
said
never
saw
anything
yet
worth
flying
for
but
the
birds
said
it
would
be
a
bad
idea
at
all
no
sooner
said
than
done
jinny
diver
the
cormorant
gave
the
whistle
to
fly
and
instantly
off
they
started
speeding
on
great
strong
wings
the
eagle
led
the
way
the
little
ones
following
fat
bird
of
the
barley
straggling
far
in
the
rear
but
the
seven
sleepers
the
bat
the
cooag
the
cuckoo
and
the
others
did
stir
the
sleep
had
fallen
on
them
the
eagle
flew
up
and
up
and
away
away
to
the
sun
till
he
could
lift
a
feather
an
inch
higher
then
he
peered
down
into
the
blue
to
the
birds
far
far
below
and
he
let
a
scream
out
of
him
mish
ree
ny
ein
ree
ny
ein
am
king
of
the
birds
king
of
the
birds
but
little
jinny
wren
was
one
too
many
for
him
there
again
she
had
taken
tight
hold
of
him
by
a
feather
under
his
great
broad
wing
and
hidden
herself
and
as
he
cried
mish
ree
ny
ein
she
flew
on
top
of
his
head
and
called
out
nel
cha
nel
ta
mish
so
not
so
i
above
him
i
above
him
down
dropped
the
eagle
and
down
dropped
the
wren
breathless
but
king
of
the
birds
and
that
why
the
boys
go
round
on
stephen
day
to
this
day
singing
the
wren
the
wren
the
king
of
all
birds
we
caught
stephen
day
in
the
gorse
though
he
small
his
family
is
many
we
pray
you
good
woman
give
us
a
drop
to
drink
the
moddey
doo
or
the
black
dog
of
peel
castle
in
the
days
when
charles
ii
was
king
in
england
and
charles
earl
of
derby
king
in
mann
peel
castle
was
always
garrisoned
by
soldiers
the
was
just
inside
the
great
entrance
gate
of
the
castle
and
a
passage
used
to
lead
from
it
through
one
of
the
old
churches
to
the
captain
of
the
guard
room
at
the
end
of
the
day
one
of
the
soldiers
locked
the
castle
gates
and
carried
the
keys
through
the
dark
passage
to
the
captain
they
would
take
it
in
turns
about
this
time
one
and
another
began
to
notice
sometimes
in
one
room
sometimes
in
another
a
big
black
dog
with
rough
curly
hair
he
did
not
belong
to
any
person
there
and
nobody
knew
anything
about
him
but
every
night
when
the
candles
were
lighted
in
the
and
the
fire
was
burning
bright
he
would
come
from
the
dark
passage
and
lay
himself
down
by
the
hearth
he
made
no
sound
but
lay
there
till
the
break
of
day
and
then
he
would
get
up
and
disappear
into
the
passage
the
soldiers
were
terrified
of
him
at
first
but
after
a
time
they
were
used
to
the
sight
of
him
and
lost
some
of
their
fear
though
they
still
looked
on
him
as
something
more
than
mortal
while
he
was
in
the
room
the
men
were
quiet
and
sober
and
no
bad
words
were
spoken
when
the
hour
came
to
carry
the
keys
to
the
captain
two
of
them
would
always
go
together
no
man
would
face
the
dark
passage
alone
one
night
however
one
foolish
fellow
had
drunk
more
than
was
good
for
him
and
he
began
to
brag
and
boast
that
he
was
not
afraid
of
the
dog
it
was
not
his
turn
to
take
the
keys
but
to
show
how
brave
he
was
he
said
that
he
would
take
them
alone
he
dared
the
dog
to
follow
him
him
come
he
shouted
laughing
see
whether
he
be
dog
or
devil
his
friends
were
terrified
and
tried
to
hold
him
back
but
he
snatched
up
the
keys
and
went
out
into
the
passage
the
black
dog
slowly
got
up
from
before
the
fire
and
followed
him
there
was
a
dead
silence
in
the
no
sound
was
heard
but
the
dashing
of
the
waves
on
the
steep
rocks
of
the
castle
islet
after
a
few
minutes
there
came
from
the
dark
passage
the
most
awful
and
unearthly
screams
and
howls
but
not
a
soldier
dared
to
move
to
see
what
was
going
on
they
looked
at
each
other
in
horror
presently
they
heard
steps
and
the
rash
fellow
came
back
into
the
room
his
face
was
ghastly
pale
and
twisted
with
fear
he
spoke
not
a
word
then
or
afterwards
in
three
days
he
was
dead
and
nobody
ever
knew
what
had
happened
to
him
that
fearful
night
the
black
dog
has
never
been
seen
again
little
red
bird
little
red
bird
of
the
black
turf
ground
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
i
slept
last
night
on
the
top
of
the
briar
and
oh
what
a
wretched

red
bird
of
the
black
turf
ground
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
i
slept
last
night
on
the
top
of

bush
and
oh
what
a
wretched
sleep
little
red
bird
of
the
black
turf
ground
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
i
slept
last
night
on
the
ridge
of
the
roof
and
oh
what
a
wretched
sleep
little
red
bird
of
the
black
turf
ground
where
did
you
sleep
last
night
i
slept
last
night
between
two
leaves
as
a
babe
two
blankets
quite
at
ease
and
oh
what
a
peaceful
sleep
an
old
manx
lullaby
tehi
tegi
long
hundreds
of
years
ago
there
was
a
witch
in
the
island
who
made
herself
the
finest
and
young
woman
in
it
her
like
for
beauty
was
never
before
seen
in
this
mortal
world
when
she
went
out
walking
or
riding
the
very
birds
of
the
air
would
forget
to
sing
for
looking
at
her
and
her
sweet
voice
would
tempt
them
off
the
trees
to
listen
to
her
even
the
animals
would
stand
still
till
she
went
by
for
her
beauty
cast
a
spell
on
them
and
as
for
the
men
the
poor
creatures
they
flocked
from
all
sides
of
the
island
to
woo
her
and
when
they
had
once
looked
on
her
face
they
never
wanted
to
leave
her
they
forgot
everything
else
in
the
world
all
sorrow
and
care
home
and
country
till
at
last
everything
in
the
island
came
to
a
standstill
because
the
men
followed
wherever
this
young
witch
chose
to
lead
them
their
haggards
were
empty
for
they
neither
ploughed
nor
sowed
and
their
houses
tholthans
for
they
neither
built
nor
mended
they
cut
no
turf
and
pulled
no
ling
for
fires
their
fields
were
covered
with
stones
so
that
the
cattle
died
for
want
of
pasture
and
their
gardens
were
full
of
weeds
there
was
a
strange
stillness
throughout
the
island
no
children
voices
were
to
be
heard
anywhere
the
witch
only
laughed
to
see
what
her
beauty
had
done
and
she
kept
all
the
men
near
her
by
making
each
think
that
himself
might
be
the
chosen
one
if
one
asked
her
to
marry
him
she
would
answer
maybe
i
will
and
then
she
would
say
the
same
to
the
next
so
they
spent
their
days
in
pleasuring
themselves
when
she
had
made
slaves
of
the
men
of
the
island
in
this
way
she
said
one
day
me
my
horse
for
i
a
mind
to
ride
so
they
brought
her
horse
shod
with
shoes
of
gold
with
bit
of
gold
and
bridle
set
with
jewels
with
saddle
of
and
of
blue
tehi
tegi
mounted
and
the
waves
of
her
golden
hair
flowed
down
over
her
dress
of
shining
white
going
said
she
the
country
for
the
day
and
you
can
follow
me
on
foot
if
you
like
she
rode
and
took
her
way
under
shady
trees
and
through
grassy
lanes
where
and
primroses
grew
as
thick
as
the
grass
and
the
hedges
were
yellow
with
gorse
she
went
on
by
fields
covered
with
stones
which
were
once
fine
corn
land
and
on
she
went
at
the
head
of
them
by
lonely
little
tholthans
whose
roofs
had
sunk
in
on
the
hearth
and
then
by
spots
where
houses
once
had
been
now
marked
by
jenny
nettles
and
an
old
tramman
tree
her
way
mounted
upwards
among
hills
shining
in
the
may
sunlight
and
through
gills
where
little
streams
ran
down
between
banks
covered
with
fern
and
briar
and
many
a
flower
to
the
blue
sea
at
last
they
found
themselves
at
the
side
of
a
bright
swift
river
and
she
put
a
spell
on
it
and
made
it
seem
shallow
and
as
smooth
and
clear
as
glass
so
that
the
little
stones
at
the
bottom
were
barely
covered
then
when
they
were
all
beginning
to
wade
through
it
she
took
off
the
spell
and
the
water
rushed
over
their
heads
and
swallowed
up
the
six
hundred
poor
lovers
with
that
she
made
a
bat
of
herself
and
rose
up
in
the
air
and
flew
out
of
sight
her
horse
turned
into
a
perkin
plunged
to
the
bottom
of
the
stream
and
swam
away
out
to
sea
and
was
never
more
seen
from
that
time
the
wise
men
of
the
island
made
their
women
go
on
foot
and
follow
their
husbands
wherever
they
should
lead
so
that
no
such
accident
should
happen
again
if
by
chance
a
woman
went
first
anyone
who
saw
her
cried
out
tegi
tehi
tegi
journey
took
the
biggest
journey
in
his
life
without
meaning
to
do
it
at
all
one
night
he
was
going
towards
ballaquirk
taking
his
time
and
thinking
of
his
younger
days
when
all
of
a
sudden
he
heard
a
great
murmur
of
people
coming
up
behind
him
and
before
he
had
time
to
look
round
him
he
felt
himself
getting
jostled
and
a
voice
asked
him
middling
sharp
too
business
have
you
here
in
our
way
at
this
hour
of
the
night
am
sorry
to
give
anyone
trouble
said
john
get
over
the
hedge
out
of
the
road
then
the
leader
came
and
touched
him
with
the
little
stick
he
was
carrying
and
said
to
the
others
take
him
with
us
he
be
useful
enough
among
the
rest
at
that
there
was
a
big
titter
and
john
felt
himself
all
altered
like
and
a
thing
like
a
load
came
on
to
his
back
then
they
all
went
on
together
themselves
talking
and
laughing
away
as
soon
as
they
came
near
the
ballaragh
chapel
though
all
was
as
silent
as
the
grave
the
houses
were
dark
and
the
only
thing
they
saw
stirring
was
dog
and
as
soon
as
he
smelt
themselves
he
took
to
his
heels
with
his
tail
between
his
legs
it
was
a
fine
easy
night
with
just
a
touch
of
soft
fog
on
and
a
little
air
coming
down
from
the
mountain
as
we
got
to
there
the
leader
sounded
his
big
ram
horn
and
as
they
went
galloping
down
to
the
dhoon
out
came
some
more
of
the
lil
fellas
from
the
gill
and
joined
them
and
more
talking
and
laughing
went
on
he
blew
another
blast
at
ballellin
for
there
they
could
see
the
fog
rolling
down
from
again
he
blew
at
ballagorry
and
they
slacked
down
a
bit
and
you
would
have
thought
the
whole
glen
would
have
wakened
up
with
the
echoes
down
at
the
bridge
they
could
see
the
lights
going
about
like
then
the
leader
shouted
into
your
lines
there
my
boys
and
the
maughold
lil
fellas
put
themselves
in
rows
on
the
walls
of
the
bridge
just
under
the
big
cherry
trees
holding
their
coloured
lanthorns
on
the
points
of
their
sticks
to
give
light
round
that
dirty
turn
then
when
all
had
passed
they
joined
in
and
followed
behind
away
they
all
went
down
slieu
lewaige
fit
to
break
their
necks
they
slackened
off
a
bit
as
they
got
to
folieu
and
then
took
their
time
as
far
as
ballure
bridge
where
there
was
a
big
lanthorn
hanging
up
in
a
tree
over
the
old
mill
as
soon
as
they
saw
this
two
of
themselves
blew
horns
and
then
a
host
of
riders
came
out
of
the
mill
blowing
horns
too
they
turned
up
the
gill
and
all
of
a
sudden
the
whole
crowd
with
john
among
them
were
right
in
the
middle
of
a
big
camp
of
the
lil
people
there
were
lights
hanging
all
about
in
the
trees
and
fires
blazing
under
the
cowree
pots
and
musicians
playing
fine
music
oh
the
taking
joy
there
was
some
were
going
round
giving
for
the
cowree
and
binjean
and
then
handing
round
the
oatbread
and
cheese
and
the
tramman
wine
then
the
little
fiddlers
and
fluters
and
and
the
drummers
got
upon
the
top
of
a
big
rock
and
the
lil
fellas
began
to
dance
till
john
head
took
the
reel
watching
them
it
was
a
grand
sight
to
see
the
nice
little
girls
in
their
red
petticoats
and
white
stockings
and
shoes
with
silver
buckles
on
and
little
bells
all
tinkling
in
their
hair
and
the
lil
men
in
their
white
knee
breeches
loghtan
stockings
and
spotted
carranes
in
the
middle
of
it
all
up

lil

john
before

says
john
man
he
said
tipping
john
on
the
head
with
his
little
stick
again
john
did
remember
any
more
till
he
wakened
at
the
break
of
day
close
to
his
own
house
and
little
the
worse
for
his
long
journey
a
bad
wish
may
the

the
against

in

beneath

on
the
floor
what
if

spotted

the
glashtan
would
thee
take
for
all
and
the
fynoderee
of
the
glen
waddling
to
make
of
thee
a
bolster
against
the
wall
the
fairy
of
the
glen
and
the
buggane

and
all

company
may
they
gather
together
about

and
in
a
creel
run
off
with
thee
from
an
old
manx
ballad
the
witch
of
slieu
whallian
it
was
midsummer
day
and
the
peel
herring
fleet
with
sails
half
set
was
ready
for
sea
the
men
had
their
barley
sown
and
their
potatoes
down
and
now
their
boats
were
rigged
and
nets
stowed
on
board
and
they
were
ready
for
the
harvest
of
the
sea
it
was
a
fine
day
the
sky
was
clear
and
the
wind
was
in
the
right
airt
being
from
the
north
but
as
they
say
custom
will
not
get
custom
custom
will
weep
a
basinful
of
water
was
brought
from
the
holy
well
and
given
to
the
wise
woman
that
sold
fair
winds
as
she
stood
on
the
with
the
women
and
children
to
watch
the
boats
off
they
told
her
to
look
and
tell
of
the
luck
of
the
herring
fleet
she
bent
over
the
water
and
as
she
looked
her
face
grew
pale
with
fear
and
she
gasped
hurroose
an
do
ye
know
what
i
seeing
us
hear
said
they
i
seeing
the
wild
waves
lashed
to
foam
away
by
great
bradda
head
i
seeing
the
surge
round
the
chicken
rock
an
the
lip
is
red
i
seeing
where
corpses
toss
in
the
sound
with
nets
an
gear
an
spars
an
never
a
one
of
the
fishing
fleet
is
riding
under
the
stars
there
was
a
dead
hush
and
the
men
gathered
close
together
muttering
till
gorry
the
admiral
of
the
fishing
fleet
stepped
forward
caught
the
basin
out
of
her
hands
and
flung
it
out
to
sea
growling
as
i
alive
sure
as
i
alive
woman
i
more
than
half
a
mind
to
heave
you
in
after
it
if

way
the
like
of

crew

be

into
the
sea
boys

shot
for

bleb
come
on
let
go
an
chonce
it
with
the
help
of
god
no
herring
no
wedding
let
go
an
chonce
it
said
young
cashen
so
hoisting
sails
they
left
the
port
and
when
the
land
was
fairly
opened
out
so
that
they
could
see
the
calf
they
headed
for
the
south
and
stood
out
for
the
shoulder
soon
a
fine
breeze
put
them
in
the
and
every
man
was
looking
out
for
signs
of
herring
perkins
gannets
fish
playing
on
the
surface
oily
water
and
such
like
when
the
sun
was
set
and
the
evening
was
too
dark
to
see
the
admiral
flag
the
skipper
of
each
lugger
held
his
arm
out
at
full
length
and
when
he
could
no
longer
see
the
black
in
his
he
ordered
the
men
to
shoot
their
nets
and
as
they
lay
to
their
trains
it
all
fell
out
as
the
witch
had
said
soon
the
sea
put
on
another
face
the
wind
from
westward
blew
a
sudden
gale
and
swelled
up
the
waves
with
foam
the
boats
were
driven
hither
and
thither
and
the
anchors
dragged
quickly
behind
them
then
the
men
hoisted
sail
before
the
wind
and
struggled
to
get
back
to
land
and
the
lightning
was
all
the
light
they
had
it
was
so
black
dark
that
they
could
see
no
hill
and
above
the
uproar
of
the
sea
they
could
hear
the
surges
pounding
on
the
rocky
coast
the
waves
were
rising
like
mountains
breaking
over
the
boats
and
harrying
them
from
stem
to
stern
they
were
dashed
to
pieces
on
the
rocks
of
the
calf
and
only
two
men
escaped
with
their
lives
but
there
was
one
boat
that
had
got
safe
back
to
port
before
the
storm
and
that
was
the
boat
of
the
seven
boys
she
was
a
dalby
boat
and
belonged
to
seven
young
men
who
were
all
unmarried
they
were
always
good
to
the
dooinney
marrey
the
merman
and
when
they
were
hauling
their
nets
they
would
throw
him
a
dishful
of
herring
and
in
return
they
had
always
good
luck
with
their
fishing
this
night
after
the
fleet
had
shot
their
nets
sometime
the
night
being
still
fine
and
calm
the
seven
boys
heard
the
voice
of
the
merman
hailing
them
and
saying
is
calm
and
fine
now
there
will
be
storm
enough
soon
when
the
skipper
heard
this
he
said
herring
must
hang
by
its
own
gills
and
he
and
his
crew
at
once
put
their
nets
on
board
and
gained
the
harbour
and
it
was
given
for
law
ever
after
that
no
crew
was
to
be
made
up
of
single
men
only
there
was
to
be
at
least
one
married
man
on
board
and
no
man
was
bound
by
his
hiring
to
fish
in
this
same
south
sea
which
was
called
sea
of
blood
from
that
day
as
for
the
witch
they
said
she
had
raised
the
storm
by
her
spells
and
they
took
her
to
the
top
of
the
great
mountain
slieu
whallian
put
her
into
a
spiked
barrel
and
rolled
her
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
where
the
barrel
sank
into
the
bog
for
many
and
many
a
long
year
there
was
a
bare
track
down
the
steep
where
grass
would
never
grow
nor
ling
nor
gorse
they
called
it
witch
way
and
they
say
that
her
screams
are
heard
in
the
air
every
year
on
the
day
she
was
put
to
death
the
old
christmas
in
the
days
of
our
grandmothers
old
christmas
day
the
fifth
of
january
was
believed
to
be
the
true
christmas
on
black
eve
which
was
the
first
day
of
the
christmas
holidays
the
spinning
wheels
all
had
to
be
put
away
the
making
of
nets
ceased
and
no
work
of
any
kind
must
be
done
until
after
twelfth
day
but
there
was
once
an
old
woman
named
peggy
shimmin
at
ballacooil
and
she
was
bent
on
finishing
some
spinning
that
she
had
begun
so
on
old
christmas
eve
she
said
to
herself
new
christmas
is
pas
an
surely
it
no
wrong
to
do
a
bit
spinning
though
she
doubted
in
her
heart
if
she
were
not
sinning
so
when
himself
and
the
rest
were
in
bed
she
called
her
young
lil
margad
and
said
me
an
you
will
finish
the
spinning
margad
was
frightened
terrible
but
she
got
out
her
wheel
and
sat
beside
her
mistress
the
two
began
to
spin
and
they
were
spinning
and
spinning
till
near
midnight
and
behold
ye
just
before
midnight
old
peggy
saw
the
flax
she
was
drawing
from
the
distaff
grow
blacker
and
blacker
till
it
was
as
black
as
tar
but
margad
flax
did
not
change
colour
because
she
had
only
done
what
her
mistress
bade
her
peggy
dropped
the
flax
quick
put
away
her
wheel
and
crept
in
fear
to
bed
she
knew
now
which
was
the
true
christmas
day
and
never
more
did
she
spin
on
old
christmas
eve
margad
was
left
alone
in
the
kitchen
when
her
mistress
had
gone
to
bed
and
at
first
she
was
trembling
with
fright
but
she
was
a
middling
brave
girl
and
she
took
a
notion
as
there
was
no
person
to
stop
her
to
see
if
all
the
things
were
true
that
she
had
heard
about
old
christmas
eve
saying
she
thought
the
bees
are
coming
out
the
bullocks
going
down
on
their
knees
an
the
myrrh
coming
up
in
bloom
then
she
says
to
herself
thinking
i
go
out
an
watch
the
myrrh
so
she
put
a
cloak
round
her
and
crept
out
at
the
door
into
the
cold
frosty
moonlit
night
and
midnight
had
just
struck
as
she
put
her
foot
outside
she
stooped
to
look
on
the
spot
where
the
myrrh
root
was
buried
and
as
she
was
looking
the
earth
began
to
stir
and
to
crack
and
soon
two
little
green
shoots
pushed
up
to
the
air
she
bent
closer
to
see
what
would
happen
and
to
her
great
wonder
the
leaves
and
stalks
grew
big
and
strong
before
her
eyes
and
then
the
buds
began
to
show
and
in
a
few
minutes
the
lovely
white
flowers
were
in
bloom
and
the
garden
was
sweet
with
their
fragrance
margad
could
do
nothing
but
stare
at
them
at
first
but
at
last
she
dared
to
gather
one
small
piece
of
the
blossom
and
she
kept
it
for
luck
all
her
life
then
she
went
to
the
cowhouse
and
peeped
through
the
door
she
heard
a
groaning
sound
and
there
were
the
young
bullocks
on
their
knees
moaning
and
the
sweat
was
dropping
from
them
margad
knelt
down
too
and
put
up
a
bit
of
a
prayer
to
the
holy
child
that
was
born
in
a
stall
but
the
wonders
were
not
over
yet
for
as
she
went
silently
back
to
the
house
she
noticed
that
the
bees
were
singing
and
flying
round
the
hive
they
were
inside
again
when
she
shut
the
door
of
the
house
behind
her
always
after
that
when
the
neighbours
would
ask
her
if
she
believed
in
the
wonders
of
the
old
christmas
eve
she
would
say
know
it
true
for
i
seen
it
myself
the
buggane
of
a
long
time
ago
there
came
some
monks
to
the
broad
rough
meadow
which
is
between
dark
greeba
mountain
and
the
high
road
and
they
chose
a
nice
place
and
set
up
a
church
to
trinian
on
it
but
they
reckoned
without
the
power
of
the
buggane
who
had
his
haunt
in
the
mountain
the
buggane
was
mighty
angry
and
he
said
to
himself
have
no
peace
night
or
day
with
their
jingling
bells
if
i
let
them
finish
the
building
and
as
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
he
took
it
into
his
head
to
amuse
himself
by
tossing
off
the
roof
so
when
the
roof
of
the
church
was
first
put
on
there
was
heard
that
very
night
a
dreadful
sound
in
it
and
when
the
people
of
greeba
got
up
early
next
morning
they
found
their
church
roofless
and
planks
and
broken
beams
all
around
the
place
after
a
time
and
with
great
effort
the
roof
was
put
on
again
but
when
it
was
on
a
great
storm
arose
in
the
night
and
it
was
blown
down
from
the
walls
exactly
as
had
happened
before
this
fall
put
fear
in
the
people
for
they
were
sure
now
that
it
was
the
evil
destructive
buggane
himself
that
was
doing
the
mischief
but
though
they
were
terrified
they
resolved
to
make
one
more
attempt
and
the
third
roof
was
nearly
finished
now
there
was
a
brave
little
tailor
living
about
a
mile
from
greeba
and
because
he
had
not
too
much
worldly
gear
he
made
a
wager
that
when
the
new
roof
was
on
he
would
not
only
spend
the
first
night
in
the
church
but
also
make
a
pair
of
breeches
there
the
wager
was
taken
up
eagerly
as
they
hoped
that
if
the
roof
was
one
night
up
it
would
be
left
on
so
timothy
that
was
the
name
of
the
little
tailor
went
to
the
church
on
the
very
first
evening
after
the
new
roof
had
been
put
on
he
started
just
when
the
shadow
was
beginning
to
get
grey
by
the
hedges
he
took
with
him
cloth
needle
and
thread
thimble
and
scissors
he
entered
the
church
boldly
lit
a
couple
of
big
candles
and
looked
all
over
the
building
to
see
that
everything
was
right
then
he
locked
the
door
so
that
there
was
no
way
to
get
in
he
cut
out
the
cloth
and
seating
himself
in
the
chancel
he
put
on
his
thimble
and
set
to
work
at
the
breeches
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
darkness
of
the
lonely
church
at
dead
of
night
but
with
long
thread
and
needle
he
bent
low
over
his
work
his
fingers
moving
backwards
and
forwards
rapidly
casting
strange
beckoning
shadows
on
the
walls
the
breeches
had
got
to
be
finished
or
he
would
lose
his
wager
so
he
stitched
away
as
fast
as
he
could
thinking
about
the
good
money
the
people
would
have
to
give
him
the
wind
was
beginning
to
rise
and
trees
scutched
their
arms
against
the
windows
the
tailor
looked
cautiously
up
and
down
and
round
about
nothing
strange
came
in
sight
and
he
took
courage
then
he
threaded
his
needle
and
began
his
work
again
he
gave
another
sharp
glance
around
but
saw
nothing
at
all
except
the
glimmer
of
the
place
near
the
candles
and
empty
deep
darkness
away
beyond
them
so
his
courage
rose
high
and
he
said
to
himself
all
foolishness
that
at
the
people
about
the
buggane
for
after
all
the
like
is
in
but
at
that
very
minute
the
ground
heaved
under
him
and
rumbling
sounds
came
up
from
below
the
sounds
grew
louder
underneath
and
timothy
glanced
quickly
up
all
of
a
sudden
a
great
big
head
broke
a
hole
through
the
pavement
just
before
him
and
came
slowly
rising
up
through
the
hole
it
was
covered
with
a
mane
of
coarse
black
hair
it
had
eyes
like
torches
and
glittering
sharp
tusks
and
when
the
head
had
risen
above
the
pavement
the
fiery
eyes
glared
fiercely
at
tim
the
big
ugly
red
mouth
opened
wide
and
a
dreadful
voice
said
rascal
what
business
hast
thou
here
tim
paid
no
heed
but
worked
harder
still
for
he
knew
he
had
no
time
to
lose
thou
see
this
big
head
of
mine
yelled
the
buggane
see
i
see
replied
tim
mockingly
up
came
a
big
broad
pair
of
shoulders
then
a
thick
arm
shot
out
and
a
great
fist
shook
in
the
tailor
face
thou
see
my
long
arms
roared
the
voice
see
i
see
answered
tim
boldly
and
he
stopped
his
tailoring
to
snuff
one
of
the
guttering
candles
and
he
threw
the
burning
snuff
in
the
scowling
face
before
him
then
he
went
on
with
his
tailoring
the
buggane
kept
rising
and
rising
up
through
the
hole
until
the
horrible
form
black
as
ebony
and
covered
with
wrinkles
like
the
leather
of
a
blacksmith
bellows
had
risen
quite
out
of
the
ground
thou
see
this
big
body
of
mine
roared
the
buggane
angry
that
tim
showed
no
fear
of
him
see
i
see
replied
the
tailor
at
the
same
time
stitching
with
all
his
might
at
the
breeches
thou
see
my
sharp
claws
roared
the
buggane
in
a
more
angry
voice
than
before
see
i
see
answered
again
the
little
tailor
without
raising
his
eyes
and
continuing
to
pull
out
with
all
his
might
thou
see
my
cloven
foot
thundered
the
buggane
drawing
up
one
big
foot
and
planking
it
down
on
the
pavement
with
a
thud
that
made
the
walls
shake
see
i
see
replied
the
little
tailor
as
before
stitching
hard
at
the
breeches
and
taking
long
stitches
lifting
up
his
other
foot
the
buggane
in
a
furious
rage
yelled
thou
see
my
rough
arms
my
bony
fingers
my
hard
fists
my
before
he
could
utter
another
syllable
or
pull
the
other
foot
out
of
the
ground
the
little
tailor
quickly
jumped
up
and
made
two
stitches
together
the
breeches
were
at
last
finished
then
with
one
spring
he
made
a
leap
through
the
nearest
window
but
scarcely
was
he
outside
the
walls
when
down
fell
the
new
roof
with
a
terrible
crash
that
made
tim
jump
a
great
deal
more
nimbly
than
he
ever
did
before
hearing
the
buggane
fiendish
guffaws
of
laughter
behind
him
he
took
to
his
heels
and
sped
along
the
douglas
road
the
breeches
under
his
arms
and
the
furious
buggane
in
full
chase
the
tailor
made
for
marown
church
only
a
little
distance
away
and
knew
he
would
be
safe
if
he
could
only
reach
the
churchyard
he
ran
faster
still
he
reached
the
wall
he
leaped
over
it
like
a
hunted
hare
and
fell
weary
and
spent
upon
the
grass
under
the
shadow
of
the
church
where
the
buggane
had
not
power
to
follow
so
furious
was
the
monster
at
this
that
he
seized
his
own
head
with
his
two
hands
tore
it
off
his
body
and
sent
it
flying
over
the
wall
after
the
tailor
it
burst
at
his
feet
with
a
terrific
explosion
and
with
that
the
buggane
vanished
and
was
never
seen
or
heard
of
afterwards
wonderful
to
relate
the
tailor
was
not
hurt
and
he
won
the
wager
for
no
person
grumbled
at
the
few
long
stitches
put
into
the
breeches
and
as
for
trinian
church
there
is
no
name
on
it
from
that
day
till
this
but
keeill
vrisht
broken
church
for
its
roof
was
never
replaced
there
it
stands
in
the
green
meadow
under
the
shadow
of
rocky
greeba
mountain
and
there
its
grey
roofless
ruins
are
to
be
found
now
king
magnus
barefoot
magnus
great
nephew
of
olaf
the
saint
was
king
of
norway
in
the
days
when
the
norwegian
kings
were
lords
over
mann
and
he
was
called
by
the
name
of
barefoot
because
he
wore
kilts
he
was
the
bravest
and
most
beautiful
young
king
of
his
time
tall
and
strong
and
brilliant
as
a
meteor
he
wore
a
helmet
on
his
head
and
carried
a
red
shield
with
a
golden
lion
upon
it
he
had
in
his
belt
a
sword
of
exceeding
sharpness
with
an
ivory
hilt
inlaid
with
gold
and
a
keen
javelin
in
his
hand
over
his
coat
of
mail
was
a
tunic
of
embroidered
with
a
golden
lion
he
was
a
fine
and
valiant
figure
it
was
he
who
brought
king
olaf
cup
of
peace
to
our
island
and
this
is
the
way
it
happened
magnus
was
sitting
at
supper
one
day
with
his
chief
men
and
their
talk
ran
on
the
beautiful
shrine
of
olaf
the
saint
which
was
the
wonder
of
its
age
they
spake
to
one
another
of
how
it
was
said
that
body
would
never
be
destroyed
by
death
but
would
remain
as
in
life
and
would
heal
those
who
prayed
at
the
shrine
of
any
sickness
magnus
laughed
the
story
to
scorn
and
said
boldly
is
believing
let
the
shrine
be
opened
that
we
may
see
for
ourselves
if
the
story
be
true
then
the
bishop
and
clergy
were
horrified
and
begged
the
king
king
let
not
the
thing
be
done
it
will
surely
bring
evil
on
thee
but
magnus
commanded
the
shrine
be
opened
at
once
i
fear
no
man
alive
or
dead
so
his
will
was
done
and
when
the
jewelled
shrine
was
opened
all
saw
the
body
of
holy
olaf
lying
incorrupt
and
fair
as
if
alive
magnus
touched
it
with
his
hands
but
was
suddenly
seized
with
a
great
fear
he
went
away
in
haste
but
took
with
him
the
lovely
crystal
cup
that
lay
beside
the
saint
the
next
night
in
his
sleep
he
had
a
vision
of
king
olaf
majestic
and
stern
who
said
to
him
i
tell
you
one
of
two
things
either
to
lose
your
kingdom
and
life
within
thirty
days
or
to
leave
norway
and
never
see
it
again
magnus
awoke
and
called
his
chiefs
and
great
men
to
tell
them
of
his
vision
king
they
cried
in
fear
norway
with
all
speed
and
keep
thy
life
and
kingship
so
magnus
who
was
the
last
of
our
great
sea
kings
got
together
a
fleet
of
long
ships
each
with
twenty
or
thirty
rowers
benches
and
with
bows
carved
in
the
shape
of
dragons
he
loved
the
sea
and
like
a
true
viking
he
used
to
say
will
never
sleep
under
a
sooty
rafter
nor
drink
in
the
chimney
corner
away
he
sailed
to
the
orkneys
he
conquered
them
and
all
the
western
islands
and
came
to
mann
he
put
in
at
saint
isle
and
went
to
see
the
site
of
the
battle
of
santwat
near
peel
which
had
been
fought
three
days
before
between
the
manx
of
north
and
south
the
beauty
of
our
island
pleased
his
eyes
and
he
chose
it
for
his
he
made
the
men
of
galloway
cut
timber
and
bring
it
over
to
make
three
forts
for
him
in
one
of
them
near
douglas
he
placed
the
cup
of
peace
which
he
knew
would
be
well
guarded
by
the
lhiannan
shee
the
peace
fairy
who
never
left
it
then
he
sailed
to
anglesey
and
made
himself
lord
over
it
but
he
soon
came
back
to
the
isle
of
mann
for
it
pleased
him
best
on
his
return
he
sent
his
dirty
shoes
over
to
morrough
king
of
ireland
with
this
message
barefoot
king
of
norway
and
the
isles
bids
thee
carry
his
dirty
shoes
on
thy
shoulders
through
thy
house
on
christmas
day
in
thy
royal
state
and
own
that
thou
hast
thy
kingdom
and
power
from
the
lord
of
norway
and
the
isles
and
this
thou
must
do
in
sight
of
his
envoys
when
the
irish
heard
this
they
were
furiously
angry
and
indignant
but
wise
king
morrough
said
will
not
only
carry
the
shoes
but
eat
them
rather
than
that
magnus
should
ruin
a
single
province
in
ireland
then
he
carried
the
shoes
on
christmas
day
as
magnus
bade
treated
the
messengers
with
honour
and
sent
them
back
to
mann
with
many
fine
gifts
for
their
king
with
whom
he
made
a
treaty
of
peace
but
the
envoys
told
their
master
of
the
richness
of
the
irish
lands
and
the
pleasantness
of
the
air
and
magnus
kept
it
in
his
mind
after
this
the
king
of
scotland
sent
a
message
to
him
saying
to
make
war
against
me
and
i
will
yield
thee
those
of
the
western
isles
that
thou
canst
from
the
mainland
go
round
in
a
vessel
with
a
magnus
made
peace
on
those
terms
and
so
the
norse
kings
gained
the
southern
isles
among
which
they
counted
the
peninsula
of
cantyre
because
magnus
sitting
at
the
helm
caused
his
great
warship
to
be
dragged
across
the
neck
of
land
which
joins
it
to
the
mainland
his
vikings
shouted
with
triumph
as
they
pulled
the
ship
along
with
their
young
king
in
his
red
and
gold
laughing
at
the
stern
but
all
this
time
in
his
heart
magnus
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
conquest
of
ireland
he
sailed
to
the
coast
of
down
where
he
began
to
invade
and
pillage
it
was
on
saint
bartholomew
day
that
his
last
battle
was
fought
the
irish
had
promised
to
bring
him
cattle
for
his
troops
the
day
before
but
as
they
had
not
come
he
landed
his
men
and
marched
them
to
the
top
of
a
little
hill
on
the
plain
of
coba
from
this
place
he
could
see
all
the
country
round
and
presently
there
appeared
a
great
cloud
of
dust
in
the
distance
some
of
his
men
said
that
it
was
an
army
approaching
others
that
it
was
the
herd
of
cattle
the
last
were
right
and
when
the
cattle
had
been
handed
over
magnus
and
his
men
returned
towards
his
ships
it
was
now
the
noon
of
a
calm
and
sunny
day
when
they
reached
the
marshes
suddenly
a
band
of
irish
rushed
out
from
their
ambush
in
a
wood
close
by
and
attacked
them
fiercely
magnus
ordered
his
chief
eyvinder
to
sound
the
trumpet
and
summon
his
men
around
the
royal
standard
he
ordered
them
to
close
ranks
with
overlapping
shields
until
they
got
to
the
dry
ground
where
they
would
be
safe
they
made
their
way
as
far
as
an
old
fort
but
the
irish
pressed
them
and
slew
many
of
them
then
the
king
called
to
a
chief
named
thorgrim
you
with
your
cohort
cross
the
rampart
and
occupy
the
hill
opposite
with
your
archers
till
we
join
you
thorgrim
and
his
men
did
as
they
were
told
and
crossed
over
but
when
they
were
across
they
put
their
shields
on
their
backs
and
fled
to
the
ships
when
magnus
saw
them
he
shouted
it
thus
you
run
you
coward
i
was
a
fool
to
send
you
instead
of
sigurd
who
would
not
thus
desert
me
magnus
fought
like
a
lion
but
soon
he
was
pierced
through
the
thigh
by
a
spear
he
pulled
it
out
and
snapped
it
beneath
his
feet
crying
we
young
warriors
break
these
twigs
fight
on
bravely
my
men
and
fear
no
danger
for
me
his
men
prayed
him
to
try
to
spare
himself
but
he
said
for
a
people
to
have
a
brave
king
than
an
old
king
and
so
saying
foremost
in
the
battle
he
met
his
death

he

but
a

was
not
with
his

he
kept
her
nor
with
his

nor
his

but
when
he
would
see
ships
sailing
he
hid
her
right
round
with
a

he
set
a
man
upon
a
brow

there
and
thus
did

way

they
lived

so
powerful
that
afterwards
he
was
looked
on
as
a
god
he
had
a
great
stone
fort
on
peel
island
and
he
could
make
one
man
standing
on
its
battlements
seem
to
be
a
hundred
when
he
saw
his
enemies
ships
sailing
he
would
cover
the
island
round
with
a
silver
mist
so
that
it
could
not
be
seen
and
if
in
spite
of
the
mist
his
enemies
came
near
he
would
throw
chips
into
the
water
and
change
them
into
ships
he
was
out
walking
one
day
on
barrule
when
he
saw
the
warships
of
the
northmen
were
in
the
bay
of
peel
and
with
that
he
made
himself
into
the
shape
of
three
legs
and
rolled
like
a
wheel
down
from
the
mountain
top
as
fast
as
the
wind
it
was
about
low
tide
in
the
harbour
and
there
ran
a
stream
of
sparkling
water
out
to
sea
now
the
banks
of
the
stream
were
marshy
and
by
the
grew
a
quantity
of
sedge
with
broad
green
leaves
so
manannan
made
little
boats
of
the
sedge
a
good
number
of
them
and
sailed
his
boats
in
the
stream
and
when
the
little
fleet
floated
out
of
the
harbour
he
caused
them
to
look
like
great
ships
of
war
well
manned
with
fighting
men
then
terror
seized
on
the
northmen
when
they
saw
the
manx
fleet
and
they
cut
their
cables
hoisted
sails
and
cleared
away
as
fast
as
they
could
and
manannan
and
his
island
were
left
in
peace
thus
did
he
keep
mann
and
not
with
his
sword
or
his
bow
and
arrows
in
his
fort
he
had
a
great
where
handsome
boys
made
sweet
music
and
others
played
games
and
did
great
feats
of
strength
he
had
a
horse
called
enbarr
of
the
flowing
mane
who
could
travel
like
the
wind
over
sea
as
well
as
land
swift
hounds
that
could
catch
any
wild
beast
and
a
sword
called
the
answerer
whose
wound
was
always
fatal
besides
his
magic
branch
and
his
wonderful
boat
wave
sweeper
he
governed
mann
well
for
long
long
years
manx
people
had
the
best
of
good
treatment
from
him
and
all
the
rent
he
wanted
was
that
each
one
was
to
bring
a
bundle
of
green
rushes
to
him
on
the
mountain
of
south
barrule
on
midsummer
eve
the
island
was
a
happy
place
full
of
sunshine
and
all
pleasant
things
and
no
person
there
was
old
or
tired
or
sad
manx
men
have
never
forgotten
manannan
and
this
thousand
years
our
fishermen
have
prayed
to
him
the
following
prayer
as
they
have
put
out
to
sea
even
up
to
the
days
of
our
fathers
it
has
been
used
manannan
beg
mac
y
leirr
little
manannan
son
of
the
sea
who
blessed
our
island
bless
us
and
our
boat
going
out
well
coming
in
better
with
living
and
dead
in
our
boat
the
cormorant
and
the
bat
there
was
a
time
in
the
olden
days
when
the
cormorant
and
the
bat
took
counsel
together
to
do
something
for
the
poor
as
they
had
compassion
on
them
and
they
went
into
the
glens
gathering
wool
to
make
clothing
for
them
when
they
had
a
quantity
gathered
they
took
a
boat
and
put
out
to
sea
it
happened
as
they
were
sailing
that
a
storm
came
on
and
the
waves
were
breaking
over
the
vessel
insomuch
that
the
poor
bat
had
to
leap
from
place
to
place
to
escape
the
water
and
in
the
darkness
he
was
cast
out
of
the
boat
clinging
to
an
oar
at
daybreak
he
was
near
the
shore
and
flew
unto
dry
land
a
seagull
standing
near
by
inquired
lil
bat
vogh
what
there
doin
on
thee
that
thou
are
all
of
a
thriddle
of
thrimblin
like
this
when
he
heard
the
bat
story
he
said
sure
as
can
be
if
he
will
happen
on
thee
he
will
take
thy
life
they
had
given
each
other
a
promise
that
one
would
not
leave
the
other
until
they
had
completed
their
task
the
bat
was
so
frightened
that
he
hid
himself
in
an
old
ruin
until
the
darkness
came
on
and
from
that
time
until
now
he
will
only
venture
out
under
covering
of
the
night
the
cormorant
held
on
to
the
boat
until
she
filled
with
water
and
sank
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
at
last
he
flew
to
a
rock
and
there
sat
for
hours
together
day
after
day
looking
out
for
the
bat
at
other
times
he
would
go
for
a
season
into
the
glens
and
in
this
way
they
continue
from
that
storm
to
the
present
time
the
one
hides
himself
and
the
other
seeks
him
or
the
prophet
wizard
in
the
old
days
when
there
were
wizards
and
witches
in
the
isle
of
mann
the
greatest
wizard
of
all
was
he
did
not
live
above
ground
but
in
a
quarry
in
a
hole
under
the
rock
on
the
lonely
mountain
side
and
that
is
why
the
people
called
him
the
prophet
wizard
of
the
wilderness
at
dark
he
would
roam
over
the
mountains
and
people
walking
there
when
night
was
drawing
on
would
hear
him
crying
hoa
hoa
like
the
bellow
of
a
goat
in
a
voice
so
terrible
and
strong
that
the
earth
and
all
who
heard
it
trembled
with
fear
he
could
change
himself
into
any
shape
he
liked
sometimes
he
would
be
a
goat
with
big
fiery
eyes
at
other
times
a
tall
tall
man
once
when
he
was
a
goat
he
followed
a
man
that
was
walking
along
the
mountain
road
and
that
time
he
had
eyes
in
him
as
big
as
two
dishes
the
man
was
carrying
a
lantern
and
as
he
shifted
it
from
one
hand
to
the
other
the
goat
followed
it
from
side
to
side
the
man
was
terrified
and
began
to
run
as
soon
as
he
left
the
mountain
road
the
beast
roared
after
him
hoa
hoa
another
time
in
the
shape
of
a
tall
tall
man
as
tall
as
two
men
he
followed
a
woman
who
struck
across
the
mountain
at
garey
mooar
and
he
had
great
big
burning
eyes
as
big
as
two
plates
in
his
head
the
woman
ran
with
all
her
might
for
life
or
death
and
he
ran
roaring
after
her
hoa
hoa
but
when
she
turned
down
from
the
mountain
he
came
no
further
he
was
a
great
soothsayer
but
he
would
not
foretell
what
was
to
happen
unless
some
person
asked
him
it
seems
that
he
must
have
lived
for
hundreds
of
years
for
he
foretold
a
battle
that
was
fought
in
this
was
the
battle
of
santwat
ford
between
the
north
and
south
manx
he
said
the
river
neb
shall
run
red
from
glen
crew
to
the
sea
and
gulls
shall
sip
their
full
of
the
blood
of
manninee
it
all
came
true
the
north
men
sailed
into
peel
and
ran
their
boats
up
to
glenfaba
ford
where
the
south
men
met
them
to
keep
them
from
landing
they
fought
up
the
stream
to
glen
crew
where
there
was
a
great
slaughter
and
the
bodies
of
the
slain
dammed
the
stream
and
turned
the
little
glen
into
a
pool
the
waters
of
the
neb
were
reddened
by
manx
blood
when
they
ran
into
peel
bay
the
south
side
women
had
followed
the
men
and
were
watching
the
battle
from
a
little
distance
but
when
they
saw
that
the
north
people
were
winning
they
rushed
down
and
into
the
heart
of
the
fight
with
bratfuls
of
stones
and
with
hacks
and
won
the
day
for
the
south
and
a
law
was
made
that
henceforth
the
widows
in
the
south
of
the
island
should
get
half
of
their
husband
estate
but
the
north
side
women
who
stayed
at
home
were
to
get
only
the
prophet
wizard
foretold
too
the
finding
of
foxdale
lead
mines
a
man
came
to
him
and
asked
will
i
get
rich
o
and
the
wizard
answered
there
a
butt
in
ballafesson
worth
the
whole
of
balladoole
but
the
riches
of
the
isle
of
mann
lie
hid
behind
barrule
he
also
gave
this
prophecy
to
old
juan
the
weaver
who
asked
him
for
one
at
the
foot
of
barrule
there
will
be
a
market
town
with
blood
for
hours
will
turn
roun
now
the
village
of
foxdale
stands
at
the
foot
of
barrule
and
it
is
said
that
in
the
old
times
a
great
battle
between
the
manx
and
the
irish
was
fought
by
the
stream
above
the
to
a
peel
man
he
foretold
will
be
a
battle
between
the
irish
and
the
manx
at
creg
malin
and
the
old
fishermen
say
that
that
battle
took
place
two
hundred
years
ago
it
was
a
sunday
when
the
irishmen
came
in
the
bay
and
they
found
no
place
to
beach
their
boats
so
they
turned
the
manx
boats
adrift
and
thought
they
had
the
place
for
themselves
but
they
soon
found
their
masters
the
manx
men
came
after
their
boats
and
there
was
the
battle
red
blood
running
like
water
and
the
battle
was
not
over
that
day
but
they
fought
round
into
douglas
and
finished
at
last
in
derby
haven
so
the
old
fishermen
say
then
there
was
an
old
maid
that
had
a
cressad
a
melting
pot
and
she
went
from
house
to
house
making
lead
spoons
she
was
a
bit
queer
she
would
not
smoke
a
mould
on
a
sunny
day
nor
a
misty
day
nor
a
wet
day
nor
a
windy
day
she
must
have
a
day
to
fit
herself
she
met
the
caillagh
when
he
was
in
the
shape
of
a
goat
and
she
asked
him
to
foretell
when
would
be
the
end
of
the
world
he
said
that
before
the
last
mountains
of
mann
will
be
cut
over
with
roads
and
iron
horses
will
gallop
over
them
and
there
will
be
an
inn
on
the
top
of
snaefell
that
has
all
come
true
trains
rush
over
the
island
and
for
sure
there
is
the
inn
on
the
top
of
our
highest
mountain
he
said
too
and
scotland
will
come
so
close
that
two
women
one
standing
in
mann
and
another
in
scotland
will
be
able
to
wring
a
blanket
between
them
but
that
has
not
come
true
yet
though
the
sandy
point
of
ayre
is
stretching
further
and
further
towards
the
mull
of
galloway
and
another
of
his
prophecies
has
not
come
to
pass
yet
chief
rulers
of
mann
will
be
compelled
to
flee
but
it
will
all
be
before
the
end
the
city
under
sea
now
where
langness
runs
its
long
nose
into
the
sea
and
on
a
place
now
always
covered
by
the
waves
there
was
once
a
fine
city
with
many
towers
and
gilded
domes
great
ships
went
sailing
from
its
port
to
all
parts
of
the
world
and
round
it
were
lands
with
cattle
and
sheep
even
now
sailors
sometimes
see
it
through
the
clear
deep
waters
and
hear
dimly
the
bleating
of
sheep
the
barking
of
dogs
and
the
muffled
chiming
of
bells
jees
three
kiare
queig
but
no
man
can
walk
its
streets
for
once
upon
a
time
in
the
days
when
there
were
giants
in
the
isle
of
mann
finn
mac
cool
had
his
home
near
this
city
he
lived
at
the
sound
to
keep
his
eye
on
erinn
and
to
watch
the
sea
but
he
was
very
seldom
in
mann
and
wherever
he
was
he
was
always
doing
some
mischief
so
that
his
enemies
were
many
one
day
he
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
reach
his
home
that
he
jumped
from
erinn
and
landed
in
the
island
on
the
rocks
above
the
sound
he
came
down
with
such
force
that
he
left
his
footmarks
in
the
hard
stone
and
the
place
has
been
called
ever
since
slieu
ynnyd
ny
cassyn
or
the
mountain
of
the
place
of
the
feet
his
first
act
when
he
reached
home
was
to
get
in
a
red
rage
with
the
people
of
the
city
close
by
his
next
act
was
to
turn
them
all
into
blocks
of
granite
in
his
passion
he
struck
the
ground
so
hard
with
his
club
that
he
made
a
great
dent
in
it
the
waves
rushed
into
the
deep
hollow
and
the
roaring
sea
drowned
the
din
of
the
city
its
towers
and
domes
were
covered
by
the
green
water
its
streets
and
its
harbour
and
its
crowded
quays
disappeared
from
sight
and
there
it
lies
to
this
day
but
there
is
a
strange
story
told
of
a
man
that
went
down
to
it
more
than
two
hundred
years
ago
a
ship
was
searching
for
sunken
treasure
in
those
parts
and
this
man
was
let
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
in
a
kind
of
ancient
diving
bell
he
was
to
pull
the
rope
when
he
wished
to
be
let
down
further
he
pulled
and
pulled
till
the
men
on
the
ship
knew
that
he
was
as
deep
down
in
the
sea
as
the
moon
is
high
up
in
the
sky
then
there
was
no
more
rope
and
they
had
to
draw
him
up
again
when
he
was
on
deck
he
told
them
that
if
he
could
have
gone
further
he
would
have
made
the
most
wonderful
discoveries
they
begged
him
to
tell
them
what
he
had
seen
and
when
he
had
drunk
a
cup
of
wine
he
told
his
story
first
he
had
passed
through
the
waters
in
which
the
fishes
live
then
he
came
into
the
clear
and
peaceful
region
where
storms
never
come
and
saw
the
bottom
of
the
shining
with
coral
and
bright
pebbles
when
the
diving
bell
rested
on
the
ground
he
looked
through
its
little
windows
and
saw
great
streets
decorated
with
pillars
of
crystal
glittering
like
diamonds
and
beautiful
buildings
made
of
with
shells
of
every
colour
set
in
it
he
longed
to
go
into
one
of
these
fine
houses
but
he
could
not
leave
his
diving
bell
or
he
would
have
been
drowned
he
managed
to
move
it
close
to
the
entrance
of
a
great
hall
with
a
floor
of
pearls
and
rubies
and
all
sorts
of
precious
stones
and
with
a
table
and
chair
of
amber
the
walls
were
of
jasper
and
strings
of
lovely
jewels
were
hanging
on
them
the
man
wished
to
carry
some
away
with
him
but
he
could
not
reach
them
the
rope
was
at
an
end
as
he
rose
up
again
towards
the
air
he
met
many
handsome
mermen
and
beautiful
mermaids
but
they
were
afraid
of
him
and
swam
away
as
fast
as
they
could
that
was
the
end
of
the
man
story
after
that
he
grew
so
sad
with
longing
to
go
back
to
the
and
stay
there
for
ever
that
he
cared
for
nothing
on
earth
and
soon
died
