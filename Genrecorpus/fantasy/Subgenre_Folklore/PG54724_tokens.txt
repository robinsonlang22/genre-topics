introduction
many
of
the
stories
in
this
volume
were
told
by
an
old
man
who
said
he
had
more
and
better
learning
nor
the
scholars
the
like
of
them
he
declared
do
be
filled
with
conceit
out
of
books
and
the
most
of
it
only
nonsense
is
myself
has
the
real
old
knowledge
was
handed
down
from
the
ancient
times
the
spread
of
education
and
cheap
literature
robbed
him
of
audience
the
boys
read
of
adventure
by
land
and
sea
the
girls
interested
themselves
in
the
fate
of
heroes
with
complexion
and
moustache
but
it
happened
that
the
old
man
took
a
contract
to
break
stones
for
lime
and
a
child
with
an
insatiable
desire
for
information
came
to
watch
him
at
work
i
promise
you
will
walk
the
world
like
a
queen
of
ancient
days
renowned
for
learning
and
wit
he
assured
her
delighted
to
find
a
listener
at
last
the
child
was
only
seven
years
old
and
could
not
remember
all
she
heard
so
most
of
his
lore
died
with
him
the
king
daughter
of
france
the
dark
oath
and
nallagh
child
were
told
by
other
friends
the
folk
tale
is
essentially
dramatic
and
loses
much
when
it
is
written
down
moreover
it
is
often
put
into
a
form
unsuited
to
the
spirit
of
na√Øve
philosophy
from
whence
it
springs
the
peasant
of
ancient
race
is
more
akin
to
the
aristocratic
type
than
the
bourgeois
can
ever
be
and
the
story
told
from
generation
to
generation
bears
greater
resemblance
to
the
work
of
a
poet
than
to
that
of
the
popular
novelist
who
is
the
bourgeois
of
literature
superstition
in
a
race
is
merely
the
proof
of
imagination
the
people
lacking
fairy
lore
must
also
lack
intelligence

wit

the
king
daughter
of
france
there
was
once
an
old
man
of
ireland
who
was
terrible
poor
and
he
lived
by
his
lone
in
a
small
wee
house
by
the
roadside
at
the
morning
of
the
day
he
would
go
for
to
gather
sticks
in
a
wood
was
convenient
to
that
place
the
way
he
have
a
clear
fire
to
be
sitting
at
of
an
evening
it
fell
out
one
time
of
a
cold
night
that
paddy
heard
a
knock
at
the
door
he
went
over
and
when
he
opened
it
he
seen
a
little
boy
in
a
red
cap
standing
without
let
you
come
in
and
take
an
air
to
the
fire
says
he
for
he
always
had
a
good
reception
for
every
person
the
boy
with
the
red
cap
walked
in
and
he
stopped
for
a
good
while
conversing
he
was
the
best
of
company
and
the
old
man
did
find
the
time
passing
until
he
rose
for
to
go
let
you
come
in
and
rest
yourself
here
any
evening
you
are
out
in
these
parts
says
he
the
very
next
night
the
little
fellow
was
in
it
again
and
the
night
after
that
warming
himself
at
the
clear
fire
and
talking
away
paddy
says
he
the
evening
he
was
in
it
for
the
third
time
paddy
i
do
be
thinking
it
is
bitter
poor
you
are
i
am
surely
says
the
old
man
well
let
you
pay
attention
to
me
it
is
the
truth
i
speaking
you
have
more
gold
than
ever
you
contrive
for
to
spend
i
could
go
through
a
fair
share
of
gold
says
paddy
i
am
determined
for
to
make
a
rich
man
of
you
the
little
boy
goes
on
there
is
a
lady
at
the
point
of
death
and
she
is
the
daughter
of
france
i
have
a
bottle
here
in
my
pocket
and
that
is
the
cure
for
the
disease
is
on
her
i
be
giving
it
to
you
and
let
you
set
out
for
france
at
the
morning
of
the
day
when
you
come
to
the
king
palace
the
servants
will
bid
you
be
gone
for
an
ignorant
beggar
but
let
you
not
be
heeding
them
at
all
do
quit
asking
to
see
the
king
and
in
the
latter
end
they
give
in
to
you
it
is
with
himself
the
most
difficulty
will
be
for
that
man
will
think
it
hard
to
believe
the
likes
of
a
poor
old
irishman
could
have
a
better
cure
nor
all
the
doctors
in
the
world
a
power
of
them
allowed
have
her
right
well
in
no
time
and
it
is
worse
they
left
her
the
king
is
after
giving
out
that
the
next
person
coming
with
a
false
cure
be
to
lose
their
life
let
you
not
be
scared
at
that
decree
for
you
are
the
man
shall
succeed
you
may
promise
to
have
the
lady
fit
to
ride
out
hunting
in
nine
days
three
drops
from
the
bottle
is
all
you
have
to
give
her
and
that
for
three
mornings
after
other
paddy
paid
great
heed
to
all
the
boy
in
the
red
cap
was
telling
him
he
took
the
wee
bottle
that
was
to
make
him
a
rich
man
and
he
made
ready
for
to
set
out
at
the
morning
of
the
day
he
was
a
long
time
travelling
the
world
before
he
came
to
the
palace
where
the
king
daughter
of
france
was
lying
at
the
point
of
death
the
servants
made
a
great
mock
of
the
poor
old
irishman
but
he
paid
no
attention
to
their
words
at
all
in
the
latter
end
he
got
seeing
the
king
and
that
gentleman
allowed
the
likes
of
paddy
could
never
succeed
when
the
doctors
of
the
world
were
after
failing
i
only
be
having
the
head
cut
off
you
my
poor
old
man

he
i
not
the
least
bit
in
dread
your
honour
says
paddy
the
lady
is
bound
to
be
ready
to
ride
out
hunting
in
nine
days
if
she
uses
my
medicine
his
perseverance
and
courage
won
over
the
king
of
france
and
permission
was
given
for
a
trial
of
the
cure
the
first
morning
after
taking
the
three
drops
from
the
bottle
the
lady
turned
in
her
bed
the
second
morning
after
the
treatment
she
sat
up
and
ate
her
food
the
third
morning
when
she
had
taken
the
three
drops
the
daughter
of
france
rose
from
her
bed
and
in
nine
days
she
was
ready
to
ride
out
hunting
they
could
not
do
enough
for
paddy
there
was
great
gratitude
in
them
well
the
reward
he
accepted
was
a
big
sack
of
gold
and
that
was
the
load
he
brought
home
to
his
cabin
in
ireland
the
first
evening
he
was
sitting
by
his
clear
fire
the
little
boy
came
in
at
the
door
did
i
do

for
you
paddy
says
he
you

more
gold

sack
than

i
be

for
you

but
a
different
business
entirely
there

a
great
bully
to

in
the
city
of
dublin
and

the
man

do
you
tell
me
so
says
paddy
in
troth
i
do
the
man

a
big
fierce
fellow
no
one
can
get
the
better
of
he
has
the
youth
of
the
world
battered
to
pieces
the
way
no
person
comes
forward
against
him
any
more
there
is
a
fine
purse
of
money
put
up
for
to
entice
a
champion
to
face
him
and
there
will
be
great
laughter
when
yourself
puts
in
an
appearance
they
will
ask
if
you
are
wishful
to
fight
with
gloves
on
your
hands
but
it
is
your
bare
fists
are
the
best
let
you
say
you
toss
for
which
it
is
to
be
but
toss
with
the
i
give
you
and
you
are
certain
to
win
myself
is
coming
to
that
place
for
to
second
you
and
it
bound
to
be
the
grandest
bully
was
seen
in
the
city
of
dublin
with
that
the
little
fellow
went
away
out
of
the
house
and
at
the
morning
of
the
day
my
brave
old
paddy
started
for
dublin
he
too
long
on
the
road
for
he
got
a
lift
from
a
man
was
driving
there
to
see
the
bully
well
there
was
odious
laughing
and
cheering
when
the
crowd
saw
the
champion
was
come
to
accept
the
challenge
the
big
man
was
after
battering
the
youth
of
the
world
allowed
he
had
no
notion
of
striving
against
the
likes
of
paddy
but
when
no
person
else
came
forward
they
were
bound
for
to
accept
him
and
they
asked
would
he
wear
gloves
on
his
fists
we
be
tossing
for
that
says
he
bringing
out
the
he
had
from
the
little
boy
in
the
red
cap
he
won
the
toss
sure
enough
and
he
allowed
it
was
strive
all
the
time
he
was
looking
round
anxious
like
but
he
could
see
no
sign
of
the
one
that
was
to
second
him
he
went
into
the
ring
in
odious
dread
but
then
the
little
fellow
came
and
stood
beside
him
my
brave
paddy
let
out
and
he
struck
the
champion
one
blow
and
did
he
lay
him
dead
at
his
feet
it
was
then
there
was
roaring
and
cheering
for
the
old
man
and
in
all
the
confusion
the
little
lad
got
away
paddy
never
seen
where
he
went
the
whole
crowd
took
up
a
terrible
great
collection
of
money
for
the
champion
was
after
destroying
the
man
with
a
single
blow
that
lot
of
gold
along
with
the
purse
was
promised
for
the
fight
filled
a
sack
as
full
as
it
could
hold
so
paddy
went
home
well
rewarded
and
not
a
bit
the
worse
of
his
jaunt
to
the
city
of
dublin
the
first
evening
he
was
sitting
by
his
own
fireside
the
little
boy
in
the
red
cap
came
in
at
the
door
did
i
do
well
for
you
paddy
says
he
you
did
surely
it
is
rich
for
life
i
am
owing
to
your
contrivances
then
will
you
be
doing
me
a
service
in
return
for
all
asks
the
little
fellow
indeed
then
i
will
says
paddy
we
have
all
arranged
for
to
cross
over
to
france
this
night
we
intend
for
to
bring
away
the
lady
you
cured
the
king
daughter
of
that
country
says
the
boy
but
we
can
not
contrive
for
to
accomplish
the
like
unless
we
have
flesh
and
blood
along
with
us
will
you
come
aye
surely
says
paddy
with
that
the
two
went
out
at
the
door
and
across
the
road
into
a
field
it
was
thronged
with
regiments
of
the
good
people
past
belief
or
counting
they
were
running
every
way
through
the
field
calling
out
get
me
a
horse
get
me
a
horse
and
what
were
they
doing
only
cutting
down
the
bohlans
and
riding
away
on
them
get
me
a
horse
get
me
a
horse
says
old
paddy
calling
out
along
with
them
but
the
fellow
in
the
red
cap
came
over
to
him
looking
terrible
vexed
do
let
another
word
out
of
you
says
he
except
one
of
ourselves
speaks
first
mind
what
i
telling
you
or
it
will
be
a
cause
of
misfortune
i
say
no
more
except
in
answer
to
a
question
says
paddy
with
that
they
brought
him
a
white
yearling
calf
and
put
him
up
for
to
ride
upon
it
he
thought
it
was
a
queer
sort
of
a
horse
but
he
passed
no
remarks
and
away
they
rode
at
a
great
pace
the
good
people
on
the
bohlans
and
paddy
on
the
yearling
calf
they
made
grand
going
and
it
was
long
before
they
came
to
a
big
lake
had
an
island
in
the
middle
of
it
with
one
spring
the
whole
party
landed
on
the
island
and
with
another
they
were
safe
on
the
far
shore
dam
but
that
was
a
great
lep
for
a
yearling
calf
says
paddy
with
that
one
of
the
good
people
struck
him
a
blow
on
the
head
the
way
the
sense
was
knocked
out
of
him
and
he
fell
on
the
field
at
daylight
the
old
man
came
to
himself
and
he
lying
on
the
field
by
the
big
lake
he
was
a
long
journey
from
home
and
he
was
weary
travelling
round
the
water
and
over
the
hills
to
his
own
place
but
the
worst
of
all
was
the
sacks
of
gold
did
every
bit
of
the
fortune
melt
away
and
leave
him
poor
the
way
he
was
before
he
came
in
with
the
good
people
ii
the
cow
of
a
widow
of
breffny
in
the
ancient
times
a
man
the
name
of
ruled
in
these
parts
he
was
a
cruel
tyrant
surely
and
prouder
than
the
high
king
of
ireland
or
was
a
prince
in
breffny
he
conceited
for
to
build
a
house
would
stand
to
the
end
of
time
a
stronghold
past
the
art
of
man
to
overthrow
or
the
fury
of
the
wind
to
batter
down
he
gave
out
that
all
the
bullocks
in
his
dominions
were
to
be
slaughtered
and
mortar
wet
with
the
blood
of
them
evenly
the
cows
were
not
spared
at
the
latter
end
the
way
a
powerful
lamentation
went
up
from
the
poor
of
the
world
were
looking
on
the
lonesome
fields
you
that
are
young
will
be
thinking
the
blackness
of
his
spirit
and
the
cruelty
of
his
heart
brought
a
curse
on
him
to
rot
the
flesh
off
his
living
bones
you
will
be
expectant
of
the
story
of
a
king
and
he
walking
the
provinces
of
ireland
a
skeleton
and
a
warning
to
the
eyes
of
man
but
the
aged
and
wise
have
understanding
to
know
of
the
tribulation
laid
out
for
the
good
and
the
just
they
putting
their
sorrows
over
them
in
this
world
where
the
evil
have
prosperity
the
like
will
be
enduring
for
a
short
space
only
and
a
queer
fate
waits
the
wicked
in
the
hours
of
eternity
proud
is
the
tyrant
and
wealthy
till
they
set
him
in
the
clay
humbled
with
fear
is
his
spirit
at
the
journey
end
there
was
a
widow
woman
had
her
little
dwelling
convenient
to
where
was
building
his
castle
gold
she
had
none
nor
evenly
a
coin
was
of
silver
one
cow
only
was
her
riches
on
the
earth
and
surely
them
that
had
heart
to
molest
her
like
would
be
robbing
the
dead
of
the
raiment
is
with
them
in
the
grave
herself
was
more
nor
horrid
lonesome
the
day
she
seen
the
creature
driven
from
her
by
a
man
of
the
chiefs
he
having
a
lengthy
knife
in
his
hand
at
the
fall
of
night
a
traveller
came
to
the
poor
woman
cabin
door
he
was
a
bent
aged
man
with
a
sorrowful
countenance
on
him
and
the
garments
did
cover
him
were
rags
she
invited
him
within
giving
him
the
kindly
welcome
and
she
set
out
what
food
was
in
the
place
for
his
refreshment
it
is
destroyed
i
am
with
a
parching
drouth
is
splitting
my
gullet
says
he
and
i
walking
the
mountainy
ways
since
the
screech
of
dawn
the
sun
was
splitting
the
bushes
at
the
noon
of
day
and
the
fury
of
it
was
eating
into
my
skin
but
no
person
took
compassion
on
me
at
all
with
that
the
widow
set
a
mug
of
milk
before
him
and
it
the
last
drop
was
in
the
countryside
he
drank
it
down
middling
speedy
and
he
held
out
the
cup
to
be
filled
again
is
a
heart
scald
surely
says
herself
that
i
be
to
refuse
the
request
of
a
man
is
weary
walking
the
territory
of
ireland
since
the
rising
sun
brought
light
on
his
path
there
is
a
king
in
these
parts
stranger
and
he
has
the
cattle
destroyed
on
the
poor
of
the
world
the
way
he
will
have
a
lasting
mortar
to
his
house
is
yourself
after
giving
me
the
loveliest
mug
of
sweet
milk
says
he
like
one
was
doubtful
of
the
honesty
of
her
words
the
last
drop
was
in
this
townland
stranger
and
it
is
heart
glad
i
am
that
it
refreshed
you
i
had
but
the
one
cow
only
the
grandest
milker
in
the
land
and
she
was
driven
from
me
this
day
up
yonder
to
the
masons
are
working
with
their
shovels
dripping
red
i
am
thinking
it
is
four
strong
walls
in
the
pit
of
hell
are
building
for
that
chieftain
soul
maybe
it
red
hot
they
be
and
he
imprisoned
within
them
for
a
thousand
years
and
more
says
the
traveller
let
there
be
what
masonry
there
will
in
the
next
world
the
wealth
of
the
people
cements
his
castle
there
beyond
for
the
cow
and
the
milk
and
the
butter
are
the
gold
of
the
dwellers
on
the
land
says
the
widow
but
let
you
be
resting
a
while
in
this
place
what
haste
is
on
you
to
depart
for
she
seen
he
was
rising
to
be
gone
he
raised
his
hand
in
benediction
and
the
voice
of
him
speaking
was
that
sweet
it
charmed
the
birds
off
the
bushes
the
way
they
flew
round
him
in
the
darkening
night
may
the
blessing
of
the
king
of
heaven
be
upon
you
may
he
send
you
a
cow
will
never
run
dry
and
you
milking
her
at
all
seasons
of
the
year
to
the
day
of
your
departure
from
the
world
with
that
the
place
was
bare
of
his
presence
he
was
gone
the
like
of
a
spirit
has
power
to
travel
the
land
unseen
at
the
morning
of
the
day
following
the
poor
woman
stood
at
her
cottage
door
facing
out
to
the
mountains
are
a
long
journey
from
that
place
did
she
see
a
great
wonder
a
piece
fell
clean
from
the
hillside
and
from
it
came
a
cow
white
as
the
driven
snow
she
travelling
faster
nor
the
wind
the
widow
seen
all
as
clear
as
we
do
be
regarding
the
rising
of
the
sun
in
the
eastern
sky
whatever
power
was
laid
on
her
eyes
the
distance
was
no
obstruction
to
her
vision
that
day
but
it
was
not
until
the
creature
came
and
stood
by
herself
that
she
bethought
her
of
the
benediction
of
the
traveller
and
the
cow
would
never
run
dry
that
was
the
beast
had
the
great
renown
on
her
people
came
from
every
art
and
part
to
be
looking
on
her
the
milk
she
gave
was
richer
nor
the
best
of
cream
and
the
butter
off
it
was
the
best
in
ireland
the
day
the
widow
died
a
young
child
seen
the
white
cow
travelling
away
to
the
mountains
and
no
man
beheld
her
more
nor
evenly
heard
tell
of
the
like
but
the
gap
of
glan
confronts
us
to
this
day
and
that
is
where
the
creature
rose
to
the
light
of
the
world
iii
kate
ellen
wake
kate
ellen
lived
by
her
lone
for
her
husband
was
employed
overseas
she
was
a
strange
sort
of
a
creature
pale
and
scared
looking
with
one
blue
eye
in
her
head
and
the
other
one
grey
she
had
some
kind
of
disease
that
came
at
her
with
a
fluttering
in
her
heart
sometimes
she
would
die
of
it
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
all
the
while
she
was
dead
she
be
dreaming
she
was
drowning
there
was
a
fort
not
a
many
perches
distant
from
my
poor
kate
house
and
that
was
a
noted
place
for
the
good
people
to
be
out
diverting
themselves
moreover
it
was
well
known
to
the
neighbours
that
herself
used
to
be
away
with
them
but
she
allowed
there
was
no
truth
in
the
report
now
it
happened
of
a
may
eve
that
a
young
child
seen
her
and
she
milking
the
cushogues
along
with
a
score
of
the
fairies
another
night
a
man
on
his
way
from
a
distant
fair
found
her
on
the
road
before
him
riding
with
the
little
horseman
one
day
kate
ellen
came
into
the
kitchen
of
a
friend
house
and
she
stopped
there
chatting
for
an
hour
time
she
allowed
that
surely
die
in
a
short
space
for
the
disease
was
making
great
ravages
and
the
doctors
could
take
no
hold
of
it
at
all
no
person
can
give
me
the
least
relief
in
the
world
says
she
and
i
be
making
but
the
one
request
of
my
friends
and
neighbours
let
there
be
no
whiskey
at
the
wake
sure
the
like
was
never
heard
tell
of
before
says
the
woman
of
the
house
what
use
would
there
be
in
a
dry
wake
maybe
no
use
at
all
as
you
are
after
saying
answers
kate
ellen
but
let
you
pay
heed
to
my
words
or
there
like
to
be
a
queer
story
told
at
the
end
of
time
is
the
raving
of
death
is
on
you
my
poor
creature
says
the
woman
of
the
house
sure
you
be
the
beautiful
corpse
and
every
one
of
us
paying
our
best
respects
to
the
same
not
a
long
after
kate
ellen
was
found
in
her
own
house
and
she
lying
dead
on
the
floor
all
the
friends
and
neighbours
gathered
in
for
the
wake
and
what
had
they
along
with
them
only
a
beautiful
jar
of
the
best
whiskey
they
could
not
think
to
give
in
to
the
arrangement
herself
set
out
that
they
remain
in
the
place
with
a
parching
drouth
for
company
the
whole
party
were
sitting
round
and
the
jar
of
itself
was
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
there
came
a
noise
and
shouting
on
the
street
like
as
if
there
was
a
powerful
assembly
of
people
without
and
then
a
great
battering
on
the
windows
the
door
opened
wide
and
the
disturbance
came
into
the
kitchen
yet
no
person
sitting
there
seen
a
heth
that
was
not
in
it
from
the
start
it
was
a
queer
gathering
surely
for
the
friends
and
neighbours
of
the
dead
were
silent
and
still
and
the
crying
went
round
them
on
the
air
after
a
while
did
the
jar
of
whiskey
let
a
lep
out
of
it
and
begin
for
to
roll
on
the
floor
it
was
turned
again
and
every
drop
teemed
from
it
before
the
watching
eyes
yet
no
person
seen
the
good
people
were
handling
the
drink
and
roving
through
the
house
then
the
disturbance
passed
from
the
kitchen
and
away
down
the
field
whatever
was
last
for
to
go
closed
the
door
behind
all
a
man
stood
up
and
he
says
this
is
no
right
gathering
surely
and
we
would
do
well
to
be
gone
with
that
another
opens
the
door
and
all
made
ready
to
depart
but
when
they
looked
out
and
seen
the
fort
all
thronged
with
lights
they
grew
fearful
to
quit
the
house
there
was
the
powerfullest
laughter
and
cheering
down
among
the
thorn
trees
of
the
circle
and
there
came
a
blast
of
the
loveliest
music
fiddles
and
pipes
and
voices
singing
it
is
the
good
people
are
having
the
whole
beautiful
wake
down
there
beyond
says
a
man
sure
it
is
well
known
kate
ellen
was
in
league
with
themselves
by
the
powers
it
is
more
like
a
wedding
they
are
conducting
this
hour
says
another
come
on
away
home
says
a
third
what
enticement
is
on
us
stop
when
the
drink
is
gone
from
us
to
the
fairies
are
fiddling
with
joy
but
they
bid
him
depart
by
his
lone
for
the
rest
were
in
dread
of
passing
the
fort
before
day
he
was
a
bold
daring
sort
of
a
man
and
it
likely
he
have
gone
only
for
his
brother
taking
a
hold
of
his
coat
you
be
taken
by
the
good
people
says
he
and
they
in
great
humour
after
whipping
off
with
the
whiskey
before
our
eyes
sure
it
was
more
nor
horrid
wonderful
that
kate
ellen
had
understanding
for
to
know
what
might
be
taking
place
on
the
night
of
her
departure
from
home
maybe
it
in
agreement
she
was
to
be
going
for
good
with
the
fairies
and
not
to
her
grave
at
all
iv
the
dark
oath
in
the
ancient
times
there
was
a
young
lad
and
he
gifted
with
a
temper
was
a
fright
to
the
world
of
man
he
never
controlled
his
speech
but
took
delight
in
letting
great
oaths
and
curses
out
of
him
they
rising
continually
in
his
heart
like
water
in
a
spring
well
there
were
few
of
the
neighbours
had
a
mind
to
make
free
with
himself
sure
it
was
an
odious
dread
came
upon
them
and
they
regarding
the
villainy
of
his
heart
lepping
out
at
his
mouth
with
the
words
speaking
all
the
time
he
was
middling
great
with
another
gosoon
of
the
one
age
who
would
not
be
warned
from
his
company
the
two
would
be
travelling
the
roads
and
roaming
the
fields
of
connacht
from
the
screech
of
dawn
to
dark
but
for
all
their
diversions
together
they
fell
out
on
a
summer
day
and
it
was
blows
they
gave
one
another
until
a
strong
perspiration
ran
down
from
them
and
the
air
moved
before
their
eyes
like
the
stars
of
heaven
on
a
frosty
night
neither
could
gain
the
mastery
and
at
long
last
they
be
to
quit
striving
for
they
were
bone
weary
and
feeble
as
an
infant
child
the
one
was
hasty
in
his
speech
let
a
dark
oath
that
he
would
be
the
death
of
his
companion
evenly
if
the
power
of
the
lonesome
grave
itself
was
set
between
them
to
hold
him
from
the
fulfilment
of
his
vow
in
three
days
from
the
time
the
words
were
spoken
he
died
of
a
strange
sudden
sickness
the
other
had
a
great
satisfaction
on
him
he
having
no
dread
of
a
man
was
rotting
in
the
clay
where
rich
and
poor
are
alike
and
the
strong
have
no
mastery
above
the
weak
but
in
a
short
while
a
warning
came
to
the
lad
in
a
dream
the
way
he
walked
the
world
in
fear
from
that
out
he
seen
a
field
where
he
was
standing
by
his
lone
to
confront
a
black
bull
was
charging
down
the
eyes
of
the
beast
were
glowing
red
as
burning
fire
and
it
was
no
right
thing
surely
there
was
such
a
fluttering
of
dread
on
the
boy
that
he
could
not
endeavour
for
to
run
but
he
stood
like
a
growing
rush
does
be
waving
with
the
breeze
three
times
the
likeness
of
the
great
black
bull
came
down
against
him
wounding
him
with
the
curved
and
lengthy
horns
were
upon
it
with
that
he
awoke
the
devil
will
be
gifting
the
spirit
of
the
dead
with
the
form
of
a
living
beast
the
way
he
get
bringing
me
the
dark
destruction
he
promised
and
i
looking
fearful
at
the
flames
are
burning
in
his
eyes
thinks
the
lad
sure
enough
in
a
month
time
he
was
in
a
field
and
the
appearance
of
the
black
bull
came
against
him
three
times
it
struck
him
the
way
he
was
tormented
with
the
agony
of
the
goring
horns
with
that
the
likeness
of
the
living
beast
faded
from
the
place
leaving
the
young
lad
sore
and
sorry
but
alive
he
had
peace
for
a
short
space
only
to
be
thinking
on
his
escape
did
a
second
warning
come
in
the
night
to
restore
the
cold
fear
to
his
heart
he
seen
a
black
goat
come
at
him
in
standing
leps
and
the
eyes
of
it
were
glowing
like
a
turf
in
the
heart
of
a
strong
fire
it
is
less
power
the
devil
be
giving
him
this
time
thinks
the
lad
all
the
while
is
an
ill
hour
stands
before
me
the
like
of
yon
beast
will
be
middling
weighty
and
it
striking
me
in
a
standing
lep
with
no
one
of
its
four
feet
upon
the
ground
all
came
about
as
it
was
put
on
his
eyes
in
the
vision
not
a
many
days
went
by
before
the
likeness
of
the
great
black
goat
threw
its
strength
against
him
in
the
field
three
sore
batterings
he
be
to
endure
the
way
he
was
left
lying
on
the
grass
with
every
bone
of
him
tormented
in
pain
and
a
cold
fear
at
his
soul
when
the
wounds
were
healed
on
his
body
and
the
passing
of
time
restored
his
mind
to
a
better
peace
did
he
behold
a
third
dream
of
the
night
he
stood
in
the
lane
between
his
house
and
the
field
and
the
appearance
of
a
great
turkey
cock
flew
down
upon
him
from
the
sky
at
that
he
let
a
hearty
laugh
and
he
roused
up
in
his
bed
sure
the
devil
has
little
wit
to
be
thinking
i
take
my
death
from
the
like
says
he
and
how
would
it
be
possible
a
fine
lad
could
be
scared
by
the
fowls
of
the
sky
he
laughed
that
night
and
he
laughed
at
the
noon
of
day
when
the
bird
flew
against
him
in
the
lane
but
the
appearance
of
the
turkey
cock
opened
the
joining
of
his
skull
with
one
blow
of
the
beak
like
a
sharpened
knife
was
upon
it
the
second
stroke
and
the
third
dashed
the
brains
from
his
head
and
scattered
them
grey
on
the
brown
and
dusty
path
and
that
is
the
how
he
came
to
a
bad
death
as
his
companion
promised
him
and
the
dark
oath
was
accomplished
no
spite
of
the
power
of
the
grave
we
that
are
yet
in
this
world
know
well
where
we
are
but
ignorance
is
on
us
of
where
we
be
to
repair
sure
the
passing
of
the
spirit
is
the
strangest
and
awfullest
thing
was
ever
devised
or
heard
tell
of
it
was
said
in
the
ancient
times
and
is
well
known
to
this
present
that
the
soul
quits
the
body
by
the
joining
of
the
skull
the
eyes
have
seen
evil
the
ears
have
heard
it
and
the
mouth
has
made
laughter
and
speech
of
the
same
how
then
would
they
be
a
right
and
a
fitting
doorway
for
the
feet
of
the
spirit
to
pass
moreover
i
have
heard
tell
that
the
skull
of
man
and
the
skull
of
woman
are
different
one
from
another
and
it
is
the
soul
of
herself
has
the
sorest
departure
from
the
flesh
v
fairy
gold
it
happened
one
time
that
a
poor
man
dreamt
three
nights
after
other
of
a
sack
of
fairy
gold
was
buried
in
under
the
roots
of
a
lone
bush
and
it
growing
in
a
field
convenient
to
his
house
it
may
be
there
is
nothing
in
it
says
he
to
himself
but
i
will
be
digging
in
that
place
and
if
i
find
a
treasure
it
will
be
a
big
reward
for
the
labour
he
never
let
on
a
word
of
his
intentions
to
any
person
nor
did
he
evenly
pass
any
remark
on
the
strange
dreams
were
after
coming
to
him
at
the
fall
of
the
day
he
took
a
loy
in
his
hand
and
set
out
for
the
lone
bush
he
was
not
a
great
while
at
work
before
the
steel
blade
struck
against
a
substance
that
had
no
feel
of
clay
and
the
man
was
full
sure
it
was
not
a
stone
he
was
after
striking
against
he
wraught
hard
to
bring
whatever
was
in
it
to
light
and
what
had
he
only
a
powerful
fine
sack
of
pure
gold
and
splendid
jewels
he
raised
it
up
on
his
shoulders
and
set
out
for
home
staggering
under
the
load
it
was
maybe
a
hundredweight
of
treasure
he
had
with
him
and
he
went
along
planning
out
the
uses
of
that
wealth
sure
the
burden
was
a
rejoicement
to
him
and
no
hardship
at
all
evenly
if
it
had
him
bent
double
like
an
aged
and
crippled
man
when
he
came
to
his
own
place
he
went
to
the
byre
and
it
was
there
he
put
down
the
sack
in
front
of
three
cows
were
standing
in
the
bails
for
he
was
not
wishful
to
be
making
a
display
of
that
splendour
before
the
neighbours
all
and
it
was
likely
he
would
find
some
person
within
making
their
cailee
sure
enough
when
he
went
in
on
the
door
of
the
house
he
seen
two
men
sitting
by
the
fire
and
they
in
no
haste
to
depart
now
the
strangers
had
the
english
only
and
the
people
of
the
house
spoke
irish
with
one
another
says
himself
using
the
gaelic
i
have
a
beautiful
treasure
without
bars
of
fine
gold
are
in
it
and
jewels
would
be
the
delight
of
a
queen
of
the
world
oh
bring
it
into
the
house
says
she
sure
it
will
rise
my
heart
to
be
looking
on
the
like
the
hunger
of
it
is
put
on
my
eyes
by
your
words
speaking
i
have
better
wit
than
to
make
display
of
my
fortune
to
every
person
is
living
in
the
land
says
he
let
you
content
yourself
until
the
two
men
have
departed
and
then
we
fetch
the
sack
in
from
the
byre
where
i
left
it
in
front
of
the
cows
when
the
man
and
woman
of
the
house
were
shut
of
the
company
they
went
out
to
the
yard
and
they
fair
wild
with
delight
himself
told
the
story
of
the
three
dreams
and
the
finding
of
the
gold
in
under
the
roots
of
the
lone
bush
did
you
spit
on
it
she
inquires
i
did
not
says
he
with
that
she
allowed
he
was
after
making
a
big
mistake
how
would
that
be
he
asks
my
father
had
great
knowledge
of
the
like
says
herself
i
often
heard
him
tell
of
how
those
treasures
do
be
enchanted
and
power
is
on
them
for
to
melt
away
but
if
a
man
was
to
spit
on
fairy
gold
get
keeping
it
surely
am
i
after
bringing
it
this
far
says
he
and
the
weight
of
it
destroying
my
shoulders
with
bruises
and
pains
not
the
least
sign
of
melting
was
on
yon
article
and
it
a
warrant
to
bring
down
the
scales
at
a
hundred
and
more
with
that
they
went
into
the
byre
and
they
seen
the
three
cows
were
striving
to
break
out
of
the
bails
they
are
in
dread
of
what
lying
there
in
front
says
herself
the
cattle
of
the
world
have
good
wisdom
surely
and
they
do
be
looking
on
more
nor
the
eye
of
man
gets
leave
to
behold
quit
raving
about
the
cows
says
he
look
at
my
lovely
sack
and
it
bulging
full
when
the
two
went
up
to
the
head
of
the
bails
the
woman
let
a
great
cry
out
of
her
what
are
you
after
bringing
to
this
place
from
among
the
roots
of
the
lone
bush
it
has
the
movement
of
life
in
it
and
how
could
the
like
be
treasure
at
all
hold
your
whisht
woman
says
the
husband
and
he
middling
vexed
at
her
words
will
you
look
at
the
bag
is
turning
over
on
the
ground
says
she
he
seen
there
was
truth
in
her
words
but
all
the
while
he
would
not
give
in
to
be
scared
it
is
likely
a
rat
is
after
creeping
in
he
allows
and
he
is
having
his
own
times
striving
to
win
out
let
you
open
the
sack
and
i
will
be
praying
aloud
for
protection
on
us
for
it
is
no
right
thing
is
in
it
at
all
says
herself
with
that
he
went
over
and
he
turned
the
hundredweight
of
treasure
until
he
had
it
propped
up
against
the
bails
when
he
began
for
to
open
the
bag
the
cows
went
fair
wild
striving
and
roaring
and
stamping
to
get
away
from
the
place
entirely
the
head
of
a
great
eel
looked
out
from
under
the
man
hand
where
he
was
groping
for
the
treasure
the
eyes
of
it
were
the
colour
of
flame
and
as
blinding
to
the
sight
as
the
naked
sun
at
noon
of
a
summer
day
the
man
gave
one
lep
that
carried
him
to
the
door
and
there
the
paralysis
of
dread
held
him
down
herself
let
a
scream
could
be
heard
in
the
next
townland
but
she
never
asked
to
stir
from
where
she
was
standing
the
appearance
of
the
eel
twisted
itself
out
of
the
sack
and
travelled
along
the
ground
putting
the
six
feet
of
its
length
into
the
awfullest
loops
and
knots
were
ever
seen
then
it
reared
up
its
head
and
neck
to
stand
swaying
for
a
while
a
full
half
of
it
in
the
air
the
man
and
woman
were
convenient
to
the
door
but
the
both
were
too
scared
to
go
out
on
it
they
watched
the
eel
and
they
seen
it
twist
up
round
a
bail
until
the
head
of
it
was
touching
the
roof
did
it
break
away
out
through
the
thatch
and
whether
it
melted
off
the
face
of
the
earth
or
travelled
to
other
parts
was
never
heard
tell
but
the
likeness
of
that
beast
was
the
whole
and
only
treasure
came
out
of
the
sack
the
poor
man
dug
from
under
the
roots
of
the
lone
bush
where
the
fairy
gold
was
hid
vi
of
connacht
i
there
was
a
fine
young
gentleman
the
name
of
he
had
a
most
beautiful
countenance
and
for
strength
and
prowess
there
was
none
to
equal
him
in
the
baronies
of
connacht
but
he
began
to
dwine
away
and
no
person
knew
what
ailed
him
he
used
no
food
at
all
and
he
became
greatly
reduced
the
way
he
was
not
able
to
rise
from
his
bed
and
he
letting
horrid
groans
and
lamentations
out
of
him
his
father
sent
for
three
skilled
doctors
to
come
and
find
out
what
sort
of
disease
it
might
be
and
a
big
reward
was
promised
for
the
cure
three
noted
doctors
came
on
the
one
day
and
they
searched
every
vein
in
young
body
but
they
could
put
no
name
on
the
sickness
nor
think
of
a
remedy
to
relieve
it
they
came
down
from
the
room
and
reported
that
the
disease
had
them
baffled
entirely
am
i
to
be
at
the
loss
of
a
son
is
the
finest
boy
in
all
ireland
says
the
father
now
one
of
the
doctors
had
a
man
with
him
was
a
very
person
and
he
up
and
says
maybe
your
honours
would
be
giving
me
permission
to
visit
the
young
gentleman
i
have
a
tongue
on
me
is
that
sweet
i
do
be
drawing
the
secrets
of
the
world
out
of
men
and
women
and
little
children
well
they
brought
him
up
to
the
room
and
they
left
him
alone
with
he
sat
down
by
the
side
of
the
bed
and
began
for
to
flatter
him
the
like
of
such
conversation
was
never
heard
before
at
long
last
he
says
let
your
lordship
honour
be
telling
me
what
is
it
ails
you
at
all
you
will
never
let
on
to
a
living
soul
asks
is
it
that
i
be
lodging
an
information
against
a
noble
person
like
yourself
says
the
man
with
that
the
young
gentleman
began
telling
the
secrets
of
his
heart
it
is
no
disease
is
on
me
says
he
but
a
terrible
misfortune
is
heart
scalded
i
am
that
you
have
either
a
sorrow
or
a
sickness
and
you
grand
to
look
on
and
better
to
listen
to
says
the
other
it
is
in
love
i
am
says
and
how
would
that
be
a
misfortune
to
a
fine
lad
like
yourself
asks
the
man
let
you
never
let
on
says
the
way
of
it
is
this
i
am
lamenting
for
no
lady
is
walking
the
world
nor
for
one
is
dead
that
i
could
be
following
to
the
grave
i
have
a
little
statue
has
the
most
beautiful
countenance
on
it
was
ever
seen
and
it
is
destroyed
with
grief
i
am
that
it
will
never
be
speaking
to
me
at
all
with
that
he
brought
the
image
out
from
under
his
pillow
and
the
loveliness
of
it
made
the
man
lep
off
the
chair
i
be
stealing
the
wee
statue
from
your
honour
if
i
stopped
in
this
place
says
he
but
let
you
take
valour
into
your
heart
for
that
is
the
likeness
of
a
lady
is
living
in
the
world
you
will
be
finding
her
surely
with
that
he
went
down
to
the
three
doctors
and
the
old
man
were
waiting
below
for
all
his
promises
to
young
he
told
the
lot
of
them
all
he
was
after
hearing
the
doctors
allowed
that
if
the
gentleman
life
was
to
be
saved
he
must
be
got
out
of
his
bed
and
sent
away
on
his
travels
for
a
time
he
will
be
hopeful
of
finding
her
says
the
oldest
doctor
then
the
whole
notion
will
pass
off
him
and
he
seeing
strange
lands
and
great
wonders
to
divert
him
the
father
was
that
anxious
for
the
son
recovery
that
he
agreed
to
sell
the
place
and
give
him
a
big
handful
of
money
for
the
journey
it
is
little
i
be
needing
for
myself
from
this
out
and
i
am
old
man
near
ripe
for
the
grave
says
he
so
they
all
went
up
to
the
room
and
told
young
to
rise
from
his
bed
and
eat
a
good
dinner
for
the
grandest
arrangements
out
were
made
for
his
future
and
he
surely
meet
the
lady
when
he
seen
that
no
person
was
mocking
him
he
got
into
the
best
of
humour
and
he
came
down
and
feasted
with
them
not
a
long
afterwards
he
took
the
big
handful
of
money
and
set
out
on
his
travels
bringing
the
statue
with
him
he
went
over
the
provinces
of
ireland
then
he
took
sea
to
england
and
wandered
it
entirely
away
to
france
with
him
next
and
from
that
to
every
art
and
part
of
the
world
he
had
the
strangest
adventures
and
he
seen
more
wonders
than
could
ever
be
told
or
remembered
at
the
latter
end
he
came
back
to
the
old
country
again
with
no
more
nor
a
coin
or
two
left
of
the
whole
great
fortune
of
money
the
whole
time
he
never
seen
a
lady
was
the
least
like
the
wee
statue
and
the
words
of
the
old
doctor
were
only
a
deceit
for
he
did
quit
thinking
of
her
at
all
was
a
handsome
young
gentleman
and
if
it
was
small
heed
he
had
for
any
person
he
met
it
was
great
notice
was
taken
of
him
sure
it
was
a
queen
no
less
and
five
or
six
princesses
were
thinking
long
thoughts
on
himself
the
hope
was
near
dead
in
his
heart
and
the
sickness
of
grief
was
on
him
again
when
he
came
home
to
ireland
soon
after
he
landed
from
the
ship
he
chanced
to
come
on
a
gentleman
place
and
it
a
fine
big
house
he
never
had
seen
before
he
went
up
and
inquired
of
the
servants
if
he
would
get
leave
to
rest
there
he
was
given
a
most
honourable
reception
and
the
master
of
the
house
was
well
pleased
to
be
entertaining
such
an
agreeable
guest
now
himself
happened
to
be
a
jew
and
that
is
the
why
he
did
not
ask
to
eat
at
his
table
but
had
his
dinner
set
out
for
him
in
a
separate
room
the
servants
remarked
on
the
small
share
of
food
he
was
using
it
was
scarcely
what
would
keep
the
life
in
a
young
child
but
he
asked
them
not
to
make
any
observation
of
the
sort
at
first
they
obeyed
him
yet
when
he
used
no
meat
at
all
on
the
third
day
did
they
speak
with
their
master
what
is
the
cause
of
it
at
all
he
says
to
is
the
food
in
this
place
not
to
your
liking
let
you
name
any
dish
you
have
a
craving
for
and
the
cook
will
prepare
it
there
was
never
better
refreshment
set
before
an
emperor
says
it
is
civility
makes
you
that
flattering
answers
the
jew
how
would
you
be
satisfied
with
the
meat
is
set
before
you
when
you
are
not
able
to
use
any
portion
of
it
at
all
i
doubt
i
have
a
sickness
on
me
will
be
the
means
of
my
death
says
i
had
best
be
moving
on
from
this
place
the
way
i
not
be
rewarding
your
kindness
with
the
botheration
of
a
corpse
with
that
the
master
of
the
house
began
for
to
speak
in
praise
of
a
doctor
was
in
those
parts
i
see
i
must
be
telling
you
what
is
in
it
says
doctors
have
no
relief
for
the
sort
of
tribulation
is
destroying
me
he
brought
out
the
statue
and
he
went
over
the
whole
story
from
start
to
finish
how
he
set
off
on
his
travels
and
was
hopeful
for
awhile
and
how
despair
got
hold
of
him
again
let
you
be
rejoicing
now
says
the
jew
for
it
is
near
that
lady
you
are
this
day
she
comes
down
to
a
stream
is
convenient
to
this
place
and
six
waiting
maids
along
with
her
bringing
a
rod
and
line
for
to
fish
and
it
is
always
at
the
one
hour
she
is
in
it
well
was
lepping
wild
with
delight
to
hear
tell
of
the
lady
let
you
do
all
i
saying
the
jew
advises
him
i
provide
you
with
the
best
of
fishing
tackle
and
do
you
go
down
to
the
stream
for
to
fish
in
it
too
whatever
comes
to
your
line
let
you
give
to
the
lady
but
say
nothing
might
scare
her
at
all
and
do
follow
after
her
if
she
turns
to
go
home
the
next
day
went
out
for
to
fish
not
a
long
was
he
at
the
stream
before
the
lady
came
down
and
the
six
waiting
maids
along
with
her
sure
enough
she
was
the
picture
of
the
statue
and
she
had
the
loveliest
golden
hair
was
ever
seen
had
the
luck
to
catch
a
noble
trout
and
he
took
it
off
the
hook
rolled
it
in
leaves
and
brought
it
to
the
lady
according
to
the
advice
of
the
jew
she
was
pleased
to
accept
the
gift
of
it
but
did
she
turn
home
at
once
and
the
six
waiting
maids
along
with
her
when
she
went
into
her
own
house
she
took
the
fish
to
her
father
there
was
a
noble
person
at
the
stream

day
she
says
and
he
made
me
a
present
of
the
trout
next
morning
went
to
fish
again
and
he
seen
the
lady
coming
and
her
six
waiting
maids
walking
behind
her
he
caught
a
splendid
fine
trout
and
brought
it
over
to
her
with
that
she
turned
home
at
once
father
says
she
when
she
went
in
the
gentleman

after
giving
me

the
next
time

the
stream

noble

this
place

says
her
father
well
sure
enough
got
the
biggest
trout
of
all
the
third
time
the
lady
was
in
the
height
of
humour
and
she
asked
would
he
go
up
to
the
house
with
her
that
day
she
walked
with
beside
her
and
the
six
waiting
maids
behind
them
they
conversed
very
pleasantly
together
and
at
last
he
found
courage
for
to
tell
her
of
how
he
travelled
the
world
to
seek
no
person
less
than

asking
me
off
him
i
do
be
thinking
i

at
all
unless
a
king
would
be
persuading
himself
of
the
advancement
is
in
having
a
wearing
a
golden
crown
upon
his
head
the
whole
time

great
freedom

and
i
walking
where

me
with
six
waiting
maids
along
with

the
old
man

a
notion
they
inform
him

she
and
it
is
a
good
reception
you
be
getting
only
let
you
not
be
speaking
of
marriage
with
me
for
he
can
not
endure
to
hear
tell
of
the
like
well
the
old
man
made
welcome
and
he
had
no
suspicion
the
two
were
in
notion
of
other
but
did
they
arrange
all
unbeknownst
to
him
and
plan
out
an
elopement
went
back
to
the
jew
and
he
told
him
all
but
says
he

am
after
spending
my
whole
great
fortune
of
money

territory
of
the
world

must
be
finding
a
good
situation
the
way

make
suitable
provision
for

be
in
the
least
distress
says
the
jew
i
did
not
befriend
you
this
far
to
be
leaving
you
in
a
bad
case
at
the
latter
end
oblige
you
with
the
loan
of
what
money
will
start
you
in
a
fine
place
you
will
be
making
repayment
at
the
end
of
three
years
when
you
have
made
your
profit
on
the
business
the
young
gentleman
accepted
the
offer
and
he
fair
wild
with
delight
moreover
the
jew
gave
himself
and
the
lady
grand
assistance
at
the
elopement
the
way
they
got
safe
out
of
it
and
escaped
from
her
father
was
raging
in
pursuit
was
rejoicing
surely
and
he
married
to
a
wife
was
the
picture
of
the
statue
herself
was
in
the
best
of
humour
too
for
it
was
small
delight
she
had
in
her
own
place
roaming
the
fields
or
stopping
within
and
six
waiting
maids
along
with
her
a
fine
handsome
husband
was
the
right
company
for
her
like
they
bought
a
lovely
house
and
farm
of
land
with
the
money
was
lent
by
the
jew
and
they
fixed
all
the
grandest
ever
was
seen
after
a
while
got
a
good
commission
to
be
an
officer
the
way
nothing
more
in
the
world
was
needful
to
their
happiness
ii
and
his
lady
had
a
fine
life
of
it
they
lacking
for
no
comfort
or
splendour
at
all
the
officer
commission
he
had
brought
himself
over
to
england
from
time
to
time
and
the
lady
would
mind
all
until
he
was
home
he
saved
up
what
money
was
superfluous
and
all
was
gathered
to
repay
the
loan
to
the
jew
only
for
a
few
pounds
well
it
happened
that
went
to
england
and
there
he
fell
in
with
a
droll
sort
of
a
man
was
the
best
of
company
they
played
cards
together
and
they
drank
a
great
power
of
wine
in
the
latter
end
a
dispute
came
about
between
them
for
the
both
claimed
to
have
the
best
woman
i
have
a
lady
beyond
in
ireland
says
and
she
is
an
ornament
to
the
roads
when
she
is
passing
along
but
no
person
gets
seeing
her
these
times
and
that
is
a
big
misfortune
to
the
world
what
the
cause
asks
the
englishman
i
have
a
grief
on
me
to
think
another
man
might
be
looking
on
her
and
i
not
standing
by
says
so
she
gives
me
that
satisfaction
on
her
promised
word
all
the
time
i
do
be
away
she
never
quits
the
house
and
no
man
body
is
allowed
within
the
englishman
let
a
great
laugh
out
of
him
at
the
words
you
are
simple
enough
says
he
do
you
know
rightly
when
you
are
not
in
it
herself
will
be
feasting
and
entertaining
and
going
on
with
every
diversion
was
raging
at
the
impertinence
of
him
and
he
offered
for
to
fight
what
would
that
be
proving
says
the
englishman
let
you
make
a
powerful
big
bet
with
myself
that
i
will
not
be
able
for
to
bring
you
a
token
from
your
lady
and
a
full
description
of
her
appearance
i
be
winning
the
money
off
you
surely
says
not
at
all
says
the
englishman
i
not
in
the
least
uneasy
about
it
for
i
full
sure
it
the
truth
i
after
speaking
of
how
she
does
be
playing
herself
in
your
absence
you
find
me
in
this
place
and
you
coming
back
says
let
you
be
prepared
with
the
money
to
have
along
with
you
the
englishman
took
ship
to
ireland
and
he
came
to
the
house
of
the
lady
herself
was
in
the
kitchen
making
a
cake
and
she
seen
the
man
walking
up
to
the
door
away
she
run
to
the
parlour
and
in
the
hurry
she
forgot
the
lovely
pearl
ring
she
took
off
her
finger
when
she
began
at
the
cooking
well
he
found
the
door
standing
open
and
he
seen
the
ring
on
the
kitchen
table
it
was
easy
knowing
it
was
no
common
article
would
be
in
the
possession
of
any
one
but
the
mistress
of
the
house
what
did
the
lad
do
only
slip
in
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
with
that
the
waiting
maid
came
and
asked
his
business
the
lady
was
after
sending
her
down
oh
no
business
at
all
says
he
but
i
am
weary
travelling
and
i
thought
i
might
rest
in
this
place
he
began
for
to
flatter
the
girl
and
to
offer
her
bribes
and
in
the
latter
end
he
got
her
to
speak
she
told
him
all
what
the
mistress
of
the
house
was
like
how
she
had
a
mole
under
her
right
arm
and
one
on
her
left
knee
moreover
she
gave
him
a
few
long
golden
hairs
she
got
out
of
the
lady
comb
the
englishman
went
back
to
brought
him
the
tokens
and
demanded
the
payment
of
the
bet
and
that
is
the
way
the
poor
gentleman
spent
the
money
he
had
saved
up
for
the
jew
sent
word
to
his
wife
that
he
was
coming
home
and
for
her
to
meet
him
on
the
ship
she
put
her
grandest
raiment
upon
her
and
started
away
at
once
she
went
out
to
the
ship
and
got
up
on
the
deck
where
she
seen
her
husband
standing
when
she
went
over
to
him
he
never
said
a
word
at
all
but
he
swept
her
aside
with
his
arm
the
way
she
fell
into
the
water
then
he
went
on
shore
full
sure
he
had
her
drowned
but
there
was
another
ship
coming
in
and
a
miller
that
was
on
her
seen
the
lady
struggling
in
the
sea
he
was
an
aged
man
yet
he
ventured
in
after
her
and
he
saved
the
poor
creature
life
well
the
miller
was
a
good
sort
of
a
man
and
he
had
great
compassion
for
herself
when
she
told
him
her
story
she
had
no
knowledge
of
the
cause
of
her
husband
being
vexed
with
her
and
she
thought
it
hard
to
believe
the
evidence
of
her
senses
that
he
was
after
striving
to
make
away
with
her
the
miller
advised
the
lady
to
go
on
with
the
ship
was
sailing
to
another
port
for
may
be
if
she
went
home
after
the
man
he
would
be
destroying
her
when
the
ship
came
into
harbour
the
news
was
going
of
a
great
lawsuit
the
miller
heard
all
and
he
brought
word
to
the
lady
that
was
in
danger
of
death
there
are
three
charges
against
him
says
the
miller
your
father
has
him
impeached
for
stealing
you
away
and
you
not
wishful
to
be
with
him
that
is
the
first
crime
that
is
a
false
charge
says
she
for
i
helped
for
to
plan
the
whole
elopement
my
father
is
surely
saying
all
in
good
faith
but
it
is
a
lie
the
whole
time
a
jew
has
him
accused
for
a
sum
of
money
was
borrowed
and
it
due
for
repayment
that
is
the
second
crime
says
the
miller
the
money
was
all
gathered
up
for
to
pay
the
debt
says
the
lady
where
can
it
be
if
will
not
produce
it
the
law
has
him
committed
for
the
murder
of
yourself
and
that
is
the
third
crime
says
the
miller
and
a
false
charge
too
seeing
you
saved
me
in
that
ill
hour
i
am
thinking
i
do
well
to
be
giving
evidence
in
court
of
law
for
maybe
an
inglorious
death
they
be
giving
him
says
she
is
that
what
he
laid
out
for
yourself
asks
the
miller
it
is
surely
whatever
madness
came
to
him
but
i
have
a
good
wish
for
him
the
whole
time
if
that
is
the
way
of
it
we
had
best
be
setting
out
says
he
the
lady
and
the
miller
travelled
overland
it
being
a
shorter
journey
nor
the
one
they
were
after
coming
by
sea
when
they
got
to
the
court
of
law
was
the
judge
after
condemning
and
it
was
little
the
poor
gentleman
cared
for
the
sentence
of
death
was
passed
on
him
my
life
is
bitter
and
poisoned
on
me
says
he
maybe
the
grave
is
the
best
place
with
that
the
lady
stood
up
in
the
court
and
gave
out
that
she
had
not
been
destroyed
at
all
for
the
miller
saved
her
from
the
sea
they
began
the
whole
trial
over
again
and
herself
told
how
she
planned
the
elopement
and
her
father
had
no
case
at
all
she
could
not
tell
why
was
wishful
to
destroy
her
and
he
had
kept
all
to
himself
at
the
first
trial
but
by
degrees
all
was
brought
to
light
the
villainy
of
the
englishman
and
the
deceit
was
practised
on
them
by
him
and
the
servant
girl
it
was
decreed
that
the
money
was
to
be
restored
by
that
villain
and
the
jew
was
to
get
his
payment
out
of
it
the
lady
father
was
in
such
rejoicement
to
see
his
daughter
and
she
alive
that
he
forgave
herself
and
the
husband
for
the
elopement
did
the
three
of
them
go
away
home
together
and
they
the
happiest
people
were
ever
heard
tell
of
in
the
world
vii
nallagh
child
in
the
ancient
days
there
were
a
power
of
the
good
people
travelling
the
land
of
breffny
it
was
easy
knowing
they
were
middling
proud
and
conceity
in
themselves
for
they
rode
upon
what
appeared
to
be
horses
and
had
music
with
them
no
less
children
were
changed
by
the
fairies
too
and
no
matter
what
way
they
were
reared
the
like
never
grew
to
be
right
things
there
was
once
a
man
the
name
of
nallagh
lived
in
a
tidy
little
place
beyond
the
river
the
wife
and
himself
had
one
child
a
gosoon
that
could
never
be
learned
to
speak
nor
walk
nor
stand
upright
nor
evenly
to
crawl
upon
the
floor
the
whole
time
the
creature
had
all
his
makes
and
shapes
natural
and
good
only
for
a
powerful
great
head
was
on
him
the
mother
had
her
own
times
minding
the
youngster
evenly
when
he
was
right
big
she
be
lifting
him
out
of
the
bed
at
the
morning
of
the
day
and
fixing
him
up
in
a
chair
there
he
sit
watching
the
fire
until
the
fall
of
night
seemingly
contented
and
in
the
best
of
humour
he
had
great
observation
for
all
that
would
be
doing
in
the
place
and
if
the
least
thing
went
astray
he
have
an
odious
cor
on
him
the
fire
was
his
whole
delight
when
a
turf
fell
and
the
sparks
flew
he
open
his
mouth
until
you
swear
he
was
going
to
let
a
crow
out
of
him
but
never
a
sound
came
at
all
it
happened
one
time
that
nallagh
and
the
wife
went
to
market
leaving
the
servant
boy
and
servant
girl
to
mind
the
place
let
you
keep
up
a
good
fire
for
the
youngster
the
way
he
will
not
be
lonesome
and
he
looking
on
the
glowing
turf
is
his
whole
delight
let
you
attend
to
your
business
the
same
as
if
myself
was
standing
by
to
bid
you
do
all
things
particular
and
tasty
says
the
mistress
and
she
going
out
at
the
door
not
a
long
were
the
two
by
their
lone
before
they
quit
working
and
began
for
to
play
themselves
through
the
kitchen
says
the
servant
boy
we
do
well
to
be
making
a
little
feast
considering
herself
is
not
in
it
and
the
wee
coley
but
a
silent
creature
will
not
be
clashing
on
us
at
all
with
that
they
brought
the
best
of
butter
cream
and
the
like
from
the
dairy
and
the
girl
mixed
all
in
a
meskin
for
to
make
a
butter
cake
they
built
the
fire
with
turf
enough
to
roast
the
dinner
of
a
giant
set
the
in
the
ears
of
the
pan
and
let
down
the
crook
for
to
hang
it
on
with
the
help
of
the
living
powers
be
the
luscious
bit
says
the
servant
girl
putting
down
the
batter
for
to
bake
the
whole
time
they
were
at
their
diversions
nallagh
child
never
quit
watching
the
pair
maybe
it
in
expectation
he
was
of
getting
his
taste
of
the
feast
the
butter
cake
was
doing
nicely
turning
a
grand
colour
and
a
lovely
smell
rising
off
it
the
two
heroes
were
in
the
best
of
humour
chatting
other
and
funning
when
all
of
a
sudden
the
servant
boy
chanced
to
look
out
over
the
half
door
i
declare
to
man
destroyed
entirely
says
he
himself
and
the
mistress
are
without
sure
enough
it
was
nallagh
and
the
wife
were
after
delaying
in
the
market
but
a
short
space
only
the
girl
hearing
tell
of
them
coming
in
on
her
sooner
nor
they
were
expected
had
the
wit
to
whip
the
butter
cake
off
the
fire
and
she
slipped
it
in
under
the
chair
where
the
child
was
all
times
sitting
it
the
queer
old
cor
he
putting
on
his
countenance
says
she
but
what
about
it
considering
he
is
unable
for
to
clash
on
us
with
that
the
father
and
mother
came
into
the
kitchen
and
the
four
near
fell
dead
with
wonderment
and
fear
for
when
he
seen
the
parents
the
wee
lad
cried
out
hot
hot
under
my
chair
the
servants
were
in
odious
dread
full
sure
they
be
found
out
and
hunted
from
the
place
for
the
butter
cake
was
steaming
mad
from
the
fire
and
the
child
never
quit
shouting
hot
hot
under
my
chair
he
did
let
another
word
out
of
him
but
only
the
one
thing
saying
it
maybe
a
hundred
times
after
other
hot
hot
under
my
chair
well
if
he
was
to
say
it
a
hundred
times
or
a
thousand
itself
nallagh
and
the
wife
could
not
know
what
in
under
the
shining
heaven
he
was
striving
for
to
tell
they
were
all
of
a
tremblement
with
the
wonder
of
the
speech
coming
to
him
and
they
never
thought
to
consider
was
there
sense
in
the
words
at
all
it
was
a
great
miracle
surely
to
hear
the
creature
that
never
made
a
sound
before
and
he
roaring
out
hot
hot
under
my
chair
the
old
people
were
that
put
about
they
never
thought
to
look
round
the
place
to
see
was
anything
astray
and
i
promise
you
the
two
heroes
did
ask
to
clash
on
themselves
the
whole
house
was
left
through
other
until
the
fall
of
night
and
every
person
in
it
was
weary
to
the
world
with
the
dread
and
surprise
was
on
them
after
dark
the
mother
puts
the
son
to
bed
fixing
him
up
right
comfortable
but
it
was
not
a
sweet
rest
was
laid
out
for
the
people
of
that
house
in
the
darkness
of
the
black
midnight
a
powerful
great
storm
shook
the
place
it
was
like
as
if
the
four
winds
of
heaven
were
striving
together
and
they
horrid
vexed
with
one
another
there
were
strange
noises
in
it
too
music
and
shouting
the
way
it
was
easy
knowing
the
good
people
were
out
playing
themselves
or
maybe
disputing
in
a
war
thinking
the
child
might
be
scared
at
the
commotion
herself
took
a
light
in
her
hand
and
went
over
to
his
bed
is
all
well
with
you
sonny
says
she
for
she
had
a
fashion
of
speaking
with
him
evenly
if
it
was
no
answers
he
give
but
the
little
fellow
was
not
in
it
at
all
he
was
away
travelling
the
world
with
the
fairy
horsemen
were
after
coming
for
him
the
whole
disturbance
died
out
as
speedy
and
sudden
as
it
came
the
music
dwined
in
the
far
distance
and
the
wind
was
still
as
the
dawn
of
a
summer
day
sure
it
was
no
right
tempest
at
all
but
an
old
furl
blast
the
good
people
had
out
for
their
diversion
the
child
was
never
restored
to
nallagh
and
the
wife
the
fairies
left
them
in
peace
from
that
out
they
never
heard
the
music
on
the
distant
hills
nor
the
regiments
of
horsemen
passing
by
the
whole
time
it
was
lonesome
they
be
and
they
looking
on
the
empty
chair
where
the
strange
child
delighted
to
sit
silent
watching
the
turf
was
glowing
red
viii
the
enchanted
hare
there
was
a
strong
farmer
one
time
and
he
had
nine
beautiful
cows
grazing
on
the
best
of
land
surely
that
was
a
great
prosperity
and
you
be
thinking
him
the
richest
man
in
all
the
countryside
but
it
was
little
milk
he
was
getting
from
his
nine
lovely
cows
and
no
butter
from
the
milk
they
be
churning
in
that
house
for
three
hours
or
maybe
for
five
hours
of
a
morning
and
at
the
end
of
all
a
few
wee
grains
of
butter
the
dead
spit
of
spiders
eggs
would
be
floating
on
the
top
of
the
milk
evenly
that
much
did
not
remain
to
it
for
when
herself
ran
the
strainer
in
under
them
they
melted
from
the
churn
there
were
great
confabulations
held
about
the
loss
of
the
yield
but
the
strength
of
the
spoken
word
was
powerless
to
restore
what
was
gone
herself
allowed
that
her
man
be
to
have
the
evil
eye
and
it
was
overlooking
his
own
cattle
he
was
by
walking
through
them
and
he
fasting
at
the
dawn
of
day
the
notion
did
please
him
too
well
indeed
he
was
horrid
vexed
at
her
for
saying
the
like
but
he
went
no
more
among
the
cows
until
after
his
breakfast
time
sure
that
done
no
good
at
all
it
was
less
and
less
milk
came
in
each
day
and
butter
going
a
lovely
price
in
the
market
to
leave
it
a
worse
annoyance
to
have
none
for
to
sell
the
man
of
the
house
kept
a
tongue
hound
that
was
odious
wise
the
two
walked
the
cattle
together
and
it
happened
one
day
that
they
came
on
a
hare
was
running
with
the
nine
cows
through
the
field
the
hound
gave
tongue
and
away
with
him
after
the
hare
she
making
a
great
offer
to
escape
maybe
there
is
something
in
it
says
the
man
to
himself
i
have
heard
my
old
grandfather
tell
that
hares
be
enchanted
people
let
it
be
true
or
no
i
doubt
they
not
right
things
in
any
case
with
that
he
set
out
for
to
follow
his
tongue
hound
and
the
hunt
went
over
the
ditches
and
through
the
quick
hedges
and
down
by
the
lake
begob
it
odious
weighty
i
am
to
be
diverting
myself
like
a
little
gosoon
says
the
man
and
indeed
he
was
a
big
hearty
farmer
was
leaving
powerful
gaps
behind
him
where
he
burst
through
the
hedges
there
was
a
small
wee
house
up
an
old
laneway
and
that
was
where
the
hunt
headed
for
the
hare
came
in
on
the
street
not
a
yard
in
front
of
the
tongue
hound
and
she
made
a
lep
for
to
get
into
the
cabin
by
a
hole
on
the
wall
convenient
to
the
door
the
hound
got
a
grip
of
her
and
she
rising
from
the
ground
but
the
farmer
was
coming
up
close
behind
them
and
did
he
let
a
great
crow
out
of
him
hold
your
hold
my
bully
boy
hold
your
hold
the
tongue
hound
turned
at
the
voice
of
the
master
calling
and
the
hare
contrived
for
to
slip
from
between
his
teeth
one
spring
brought
her
in
on
the
hole
in
the
wall
but
she
splashed
it
with
blood
as
she
passed
and
there
was
blood
on
the
mouth
of
the
hound
the
man
came
up
cursing
himself
for
spoiling
the
diversion
but
he
was
well
determined
to
follow
on
he
took
the
coat
off
his
back
and
he
stuffed
it
into
the
opening
the
way
the
hare
had
no
chance
to
get
out
where
she
was
after
entering
then
he
walked
round
the
house
for
to
see
was
there
any
means
of
escape
for
what
was
within
there
was
evenly
a
space
where
a
fly
might
contrive
to
slip
through
and
himself
was
satisfied
the
hunt
was
shaping
well
he
went
to
the
door
and
it
was
there
the
tongue
hound
went
wild
to
be
making
an
entry
but
a
lock
and
a
chain
were
upon
it
the
farmer
took
up
a
stone
and
he
broke
all
before
him
to
get
in
after
the
hare
they
followed
so
far
the
old
house
is
empty
this
long
time
says
he
and
evenly
if
i
be
to
repair
the
destruction
i
make
sure
what
is
the
price
of
a
chain
and
a
lock
to
a
fine
warm
man
like
myself
with
that
he
pushed
into
the
kitchen
and
there
was
neither
sight
nor
sign
of
a
hare
to
be
found
but
an
old
woman
lay
in
a
corner
and
she
bleeding
the
tongue
hound
gave
the
mournfullest
whine
and
he
juked
to
his
master
feet
it
was
easy
knowing
the
beast
was
in
odious
dread
the
farmer
gave
a
sort
of
a
groan
and
he
turned
for
to
go
away
home
it
a
queer
old
diversion
i
after
enjoying
says
he
surely
there
not
a
many
in
the
world
do
be
hunting
hares
through
the
fields
and
catching
old
women
are
bleeding
to
death
when
he
came
to
his
own
place
the
wife
ran
out
of
the
house
will
you
look
at
the
gallons
of
beautiful
milk
the
cows
are
after
giving
this
day
says
she
pulling
him
in
on
the
door
sure
enough
from
that
out
there
was
a
great
plenty
of
milk
and
a
right
yield
of
butter
on
the
churn
ix
the
bridge
of
the
kist
there
was
once
a
man
the
name
of
michael
hugh
and
he
was
tormented
with
dreams
of
a
kist
was
buried
in
under
a
bridge
in
england
for
awhile
he
took
no
heed
to
the
visions
were
with
him
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
but
at
long
last
the
notion
grew
in
his
mind
that
he
be
to
visit
that
place
and
find
out
was
there
anything
in
it
i
could
make
right
use
of
a
treasure
thinks
he
to
himself
for
is
heart
scalded
i
am
with
dwelling
in
poverty
and
a
great
weariness
is
on
me
from
toiling
for
a
miserable
wage
then
he
bethought
of
the
foolishness
of
making
the
journey
if
all
turned
out
a
deceit
sure
i
be
rid
of
belief
in
the
dreams
are
driving
me
daft
with
their
grandeur
and
perseverance
says
he
evenly
failure
will
bring
a
sort
of
satisfaction
for
i
get
fooling
whatever
spirit
does
be
bringing
the
vision
upon
me
so
my
brave
michael
hugh
took
an
ash
plant
in
his
hand
and
away
with
him
oversea
to
england
to
discover
the
bridge
of
the
kist
he
was
a
twelvemonth
travelling
and
rambling
with
no
success
to
rise
his
heart
and
he
began
for
to
consider
he
had
better
return
to
his
own
place
but
just
as
he
was
making
ready
to
turn
did
he
chance
on
a
strong
flowing
river
and
the
sight
near
left
his
eyes
when
he
found
it
was
spanned
by
the
bridge
he
was
after
dreaming
of
well
michael
hugh
went
over
and
he
looked
down
on
the
black
depth
of
water
was
flowing
in
under
the
arch
it
be
a
hard
thing
surely
to
be
digging
for
a
kist
in
that
place
says
he
i
thinking
a
man
would
find
a
sore
death
and
no
treasure
at
all
if
he
lepped
into
the
flood
but
maybe
it
laid
out
for
me
to
gather
my
fortune
here
and
some
person
may
come
for
to
give
me
instruction
with
that
he
walked
up
and
down
over
the
bridge
hoping
for
further
advice
since
he
could
not
contrive
a
wisdom
for
his
use
there
was
a
house
convenient
to
the
river
and
after
awhile
a
man
came
from
it
are
you
waiting
on
any
person
in
this
place
says
he
to
michael
hugh
it
bitter
weather
to
be
abroad
and
you
be
to
be
as
hardy
as
a
wild
duck
to
endure
the
cold
blast
on
the
bridge
i
hardy
surely
michael
hugh
makes
his
answer
but
is
no
easy
matter
to
tell
if
i
waiting
on
any
person
you
funning
me
says
the
englishman
how
would
you
be
abroad
without
reason
and
you
having
a
beautiful
wise
countenance
on
you
with
that
michael
hugh
told
him
the
story
of
the
dreams
that
brought
him
from
ireland
and
how
he
was
expectant
of
a
sign
to
instruct
him
to
come
at
the
kist
the
englishman
let
a
great
laugh
you
a
simple
fellow
says
he
let
you
give
up
heeding
the
like
of
visions
and
ghosts
for
there
is
madness
in
the
same
and
no
pure
reason
at
all
there
few
has
more
nor
better
knowledge
than
myself
of
how
they
be
striving
to
entice
us
from
our
work
but
a
reasonable
man
and
i
never
gave
in
to
them
yet
might
i
make
so
free
as
to
ask
says
michael
hugh
what
sort
of
a
vision
are
you
after
resisting
i
tell
you
and
welcome
says
the
englishman
there
is
a
night
of
my
life
but
i
hear
a
voice
calling
with
you
to
ireland
and
seek
out
a
man
the
name
of
michael
hugh
there
is
treasure
buried
in
under
a
lone
bush
in
his
garden
and
that
is
in
breffny
of
connacht
the
poor
irishman
was
near
demented
with
joy
at
the
words
for
he
understood
he
was
brought
all
that
journey
to
learn
of
gold
was
a
stone
throw
from
his
own
little
cabin
door
but
he
was
a
conny
sort
of
a
person
and
he
never
let
on
to
the
other
that
michael
hugh
was
the
name
of
him
nor
that
he
came
from
breffny
of
connacht
the
englishman
invited
him
into
his
house
for
to
rest
there
that
night
and
he
did
spare
his
advice
that
dreams
were
a
folly
and
sin
you
have
me
convinced
of
the
meaning
of
my
visions
says
michael
hugh
and
what
more
i
go
home
as
you
bid
me
next
morning
he
started
out
and
he
made
great
haste
with
the
desire
was
on
him
to
get
digging
the
gold
when
he
came
to
his
own
place
in
connacht
he
made
straight
for
a
loy
and
then
for
the
lone
bush
not
a
long
was
he
digging
before
he
hoked
out
a
precious
crock
full
of
treasure
and
he
carried
it
into
the
house
there
was
a
piece
of
a
flag
stone
lying
on
top
of
the
gold
and
there
was
a
writing
cut
into
it
what
might
be
the
meaning
of
that
michael
hugh
had
no
notion
for
the
words
were
not
gaelic
nor
english
at
all
it
happened
one
evening
that
a
poor
scholar
came
in
for
to
make
his
cailee
can
you
read
me
that
inscription
mister
asks
michael
hugh
bringing
out
the
flag
aye
surely
says
the
poor
scholar
that
is
a
latin
writing
and
i
am
well
learned
in
the
same
what
meaning
is
in
it
asks
the
other
same
at
the
far
side
says
the
scholar
and
that
is
a
droll
saying
surely
when
it
gives
no
information
beyond
maybe
it
will
serve
my
turn
mister
says
michael
hugh
in
the
best
of
humour
after
the
scholar
was
gone
on
his
way
did
himself
take
the
loy
and
out
to
the
garden
he
began
for
to
dig
at
the
far
side
of
the
lone
bush
and
sure
enough
he
found
a
second
beautiful
kist
the
dead
spit
of
the
first
it
was
great
prosperity
he
enjoyed
from
that
out
and
he
bought
the
grandest
of
raiment
the
way
the
neighbours
began
for
to
call
him
michael
hughie
the
cock
x
the
child
and
the
fiddle
there
was
a
woman
one
time
and
she
had
the
fretfullest
child
in
all
ireland
he
lay
in
the
cradle
and
lamented
from
morning
to
night
and
from
dark
to
the
dawn
of
day
there
was
no
prosperity
nor
comfort
in
that
house
from
he
came
to
it
all
things
went
astray
within
in
the
kitchen
and
without
upon
the
farm
the
cattle
fell
sick
the
potatoes
took
a
blight
there
was
not
a
taste
of
butter
on
the
churn
and
evenly
the
cat
began
for
to
dwine
and
dwine
away
but
of
all
the
misfortunes
that
come
the
woefullest
was
the
continual
strife
between
the
man
and
woman
of
the
house
and
they
a
couple
that
were
horrid
fond
aforetime
it
happened
when
the
child
was
about
eighteen
months
of
age
that
a
strange
man
was
hired
to
work
on
the
farm
surely
he
never
have
ventured
into
the
place
if
he
had
heard
tell
of
the
ill
luck
was
in
it
but
he
was
from
distant
parts
and
did
know
a
heth
one
day
he
chanced
to
be
in
from
the
work
a
while
before
the
master
of
the
house
and
herself
was
gone
to
the
spring
for
water
the
hired
man
sat
down
by
the
kitchen
fire
taking
no
heed
of
the
child
was
watching
him
from
the
cradle
the
little
fellow
quit
his
lamenting
he
sat
up
straight
with
a
countenance
on
him
like
a
wise
old
man
i
will
be
playing
you
a
tune
on
the
fiddle
for
i
thinking
is
fond
of
the
music
you
are
says
he
the
man
near
fell
into
the
fire
with
wonderment
to
hear
the
talk
he
did
say
one
word
in
answer
but
he
waited
to
see
what
would
be
coming
next
the
small
weak
infant
pulled
a
fiddle
out
from
under
the
pillow
of
the
cradle
and
he
began
for
to
play
the
loveliest
music
was
ever
heard
in
this
world
he
had
reels
and
jigs
songs
and
sets
merry
tunes
would
rise
the
heart
of
man
and
mournful
tunes
would
fill
the
mind
with
grief
the
man
sat
listening
and
he
was
all
put
through
other
thinking
the
child
was
no
right
thing
after
a
time
the
little
lad
quit
playing
he
put
back
the
fiddle
where
he
took
it
from
and
began
at
his
old
whimpering
again
herself
came
in
at
the
door
with
a
bucket
of
water
in
her
hand
well
the
man
walked
out
and
he
called
her
after
him
that
is
a
strange
child
you
have
mistress
says
he
a
strange
child
surely
and
a
sorrowful
she
makes
answer
it
is
tormented
with
his
roaring
you
are
no
person
could
be
enduring
it
continually
did
ever
he
play
on
the
fiddle
in
your
hearing
asks
the
man
is
it
raving
you
are
says
she
i
am
not
mistress
he
answers
he
is
after
giving
me
the
best
of
entertainment
with
reels
and
marches
and
jigs

quit
funning
me
says
she
getting
vexed
i
see
you
are
doubting
my
words

replies

into
the
kitchen
and

with
that
he
went
in
leaving
herself
posted
convenient
to
the
window
says
he
to
the
child
i
thinking
there
not
above
a
score
of
fiddlers
in
all
ireland
having
better
knowledge
of
music
nor
yourself
sure
that
is
a
great
wonder
and
you
but
an
innocent
little
thing
maybe
it
not
that
innocent
i
am
says
the
child
and
let
me
tell
you
there
is
one
fiddler
itself
to
be
my
equal
in
the
land
you
boasting
you
bold
wee
coley
says
the
man
the
child
sat
up
in
a
great
rage
pulled
the
fiddle
from
under
the
pillow
and
began
for
to
play
a
tune
was
grander
nor
the
lot
he
gave
first
the
man
went
out
to
herself
are
you
satisfied
now
he
asks
my
heart
beats
time
to
his
reels
says
she
run
down
to
the
field
and
send
the
master
to
this
place
that
he
may
hear
him
too
the
man
of
the
house
came
up
in
a
terrible
temper
if
it
lies
you
are
telling
me
i
brain
the
pair
of
you
with
the
loy
says
he
when
he
heard
the
news
of
the
fiddle
put
your
ear
to
the
window
it
soft
he
is
playing
now
says
his
wife
but
the
words
were
out
of
her
mouth
before
a
blast
of
loud
music
was
heard
himself
ran
in
on
the
door
and
he
seen
the
gosoon
sitting
up
playing
tunes
let
you
be
off
out
of
this
says
he
or
i
throw
you
at
the
back
of
the
fire
for
you
are
no
right
thing
at
all
with
that
the
little
fellow
made
a
powerful
great
lep
out
of
the
cradle
across
the
floor
and
away
with
him
out
over
the
fields
but
he
left
his
fiddle
behind
and
the
master
of
the
house
threw
it
down
on
the
burning
turf
and
that
was
no
true
fiddle
at
all
only
a
piece
of
an
old
bog
stick
was
rotten
with
age
xi
the
cutting
of
the
tree
there
was
a
wild
sort
of
a
lad
the
name
of
francis
pat
and
he
was
a
great
warrant
to
be
entertaining
the
people
with
his
airy
talk
he
was
the
whole
go
in
every
spree
and
join
was
held
in
the
countryside
and
the
neighbours
all
had
a
fine
welcome
when
he
come
to
make
his
cailee
he
joined
the
world
when
he
was
about
thirty
years
of
age
and
he
got
a
fine
sensible
woman
with
a
nice
little
handful
of
money
herself
did
care
to
be
rambling
at
all
and
she
sit
with
her
stitching
or
knitting
when
he
went
out
after
dark
it
chanced
one
time
not
a
long
from
they
were
married
that
francis
pat
went
to
a
raffle
was
held
in
the
next
townland
when
the
company
set
out
for
to
go
away
home
in
the
black
darkness
of
the
night
every
person
in
it
was
afraid
to
pass
down
by
the
fort
what
is
on
you
at
all
says
francis
pat
i
think
scorn
on
the
lot
of
you
are
in
dread
of
the
good
people
god
be
with
them
and
their
faces
from
us
their
backs
to
us
the
way
they
good
friends
says
an
old
man
i
have
great
experience
to
know
that
it
a
danger
to
evenly
make
fun
in
speech
of
the
like
away
with
you
by
the
long
hard
road
says
francis
pat
is
i
will
walk
my
lone
past
the
fort
and
i
dare
the
fairies
to
molest
me
the
neighbours
strove
to
break
his
intention
but
he
was
persistent
and
proud
when
he
came
to
the
fort
he
seen
a
light
he
heard
voices
speaking
and
the
blows
of
an
axe
against
wood
there
is
one
more
daring
nor
myself
abroad
this
hour
thinks
francis
pat
i
never
heard
tell
of
any
person
having
audacity
to
interfere
with
the
trees
of
the
circle
curiosity
came
on
him
to
know
who
could
it
be
and
he
juked
over
to
the
light
he
seen
no
sign
of
the
men
however
he
peeped
but
he
heard
the
words
and
the
blows
where
we
carry
the
wood
says
a
voice
to
the
house
on
the
hill
says
another
we
be
to
bring
out
the
wife
of
francis
pat
and
the
tree
may
stop
there
in
her
stead
he
never
know
the
differ
says
the
first
it
a
fine
thing
surely
to
make
an
image
from
a
tree
that
a
man
could
know
from
herself
with
that
there
was
great
laughter
and
cheering
but
the
lad
did
wait
to
hear
more
he
sped
away
home
to
the
house
on
the
hill
not
a
heth
did
he
let
on
to
the
wife
about
what
he
was
after
discovering
but
he
had
a
strong
oath
taken
in
his
own
mind
that
the
fairies
should
not
lift
her
from
him
he
bolted
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
the
two
went
into
the
room
after
awhile
there
came
a
cry
on
the
street
without
and
it
dwined
away
into
the
byre
the
cows
began
for
to
stamp
and
strive
to
get
free
of
the
bails
let
you
go
out
and
see
what
ails
the
creatures
says
herself
there
is
nothing
on
them
says
he
i
not
leave
this
place
till
the
sun
rises
for
day
then
there
came
a
powerful
blast
of
wind
and
the
pigs
set
up
the
awfullest
lamentation
i
not
that
lazy
but
i
find
out
what
it
is
says
herself
you
stop
where
you
are
says
he
did
you
hear
the
blast
going
by
and
every
person
knows
that
pigs
see
the
wind
whatever
they
beholding
this
minute
is
a
sore
distress
to
the
creatures
she
answers
aye
he
allows
the
wind
is
red
and
that
is
the
cause
of
them
crying
there
came
a
crash
on
the
door
of
the
kitchen
and
it
blew
in
the
plates
were
dashed
off
the
dresser
and
the
saucepans
fell
from
the
nails
on
the
wall
francis
pat
had
to
hold
herself
by
the
arm
to
keep
her
from
running
to
gather
the
delf
voices
came
shouting
and
there
was
a
stamping
of
feet
through
the
house
the
woman
began
for
to
cry
and
to
roar
but
himself
kept
a
hold
on
her
and
nothing
enticed
him
away
at
dawn
the
commotion
died
out
what
was
it
at
all
asks
herself
sure
what
would
it
be
only
a
wind
was
fit
to
batter
the
horns
off
the
cows
says
francis
pat
when
they
went
into
the
kitchen
what
did
they
find
only
the
image
lying
on
the
floor
the
wood
was
cut
into
the
living
likeness
of
the
woman
of
the
house
and
the
good
people
had
thrown
it
there
in
the
anger
of
the
disappointment
was
on
them
so
my
brave
francis
pat
told
his
wife
the
whole
story
of
the
cutting
of
the
tree
xii
the
little
settlement
there
was
a
strong
farmer
one
time
and
he
was
the
boastfullest
man
in
all
ireland
he
had
a
tidy
comfortable
place
sure
enough
but
to
hear
him
speaking
you
be
thinking
his
house
was
built
of
silver
and
thatched
with
the
purest
gold
herself
was
a
very
different
sort
of
a
person
kindly
and
she
took
no
pleasure
in
making
out
she
had
more
property
and
grandeur
than
another
body
and
she
was
neither
envious
uncharitable
nor
a
clash
the
two
had
but
one
child
a
daughter
and
she
was
their
whole
delight
bride
was
a
beautiful
white
girl
with
a
countenance
on
her
would
charm
a
king
from
his
golden
throne
to
be
walking
the
bogs
with
herself
the
boys
were
flocking
after
her
by
the
score
and
she
had
but
to
raise
her
hand
to
draw
any
one
of
them
to
her
side
but
being
a
seemly
lass
she
took
her
diversion
without
any
consideration
of
marriage
at
all
well
satisfied
her
father
would
be
making
a
fitting
settlement
for
her
when
the
time
came
the
youth
of
the
world
will
always
be
playing
themselves
and
chatting
together
all
the
while
them
that
have
right
wit
and
a
good
upbringing
do
leave
their
settlement
in
the
hands
of
the
parents
have
the
best
understanding
for
the
same
i
thinking
says
himself
one
evening
that
it
old
and
stiff
i
am
growing
it
might
be
a
powerful
advantage
to
take
a
into
the
place
the
way
i
get
sitting
in
peace
by
the
hearth
and
he
out
in
the
fields
attending
to
the
management
of
all
bride
is
full
young
to
be
joining
the
world
says
his
wife
but
i
will
not
be
putting
any
hindrance
in
the
way
of
it
for
maybe
better
contented
she
be
to
have
a
fine
man
of
her
own
foreby
to
be
looking
on
an
old
pair
like
ourselves
and
we
dozing
by
the
fire
of
an
evening
i
be
making
a
little
settlement
for
her
surely
says
himself
the
next
day
he
gave
out
through
the
country
that
bride
was
to
be
married
what
with
the
little
handful
of
money
the
fine
farm
of
land
and
the
looks
of
the
girl
the
suitors
were
coming
in
plenty
there
were
strong
farmers
small
farmers
tradesmen
and
dealers
a
cow
doctor
a
blacksmith
and
evenly
a
man
that
travelled
in
tea
himself
was
disgusted
with
all
he
put
out
the
farmers
and
dealers
very
civil
and
stiff
but
the
tea
man
he
stoned
down
the
road
for
a
couple
of
miles
the
next
suitor
to
come
was
a
beautiful
young
lad
the
name
of
shan
alec
he
was
a
tasty
worker
and
he
had
the
best
of
good
money
was
left
him
by
his
da
now
if
you
were
to
seek
all
ireland
ten
times
through
i
go
bail
you
would
be
finding
a
more
suitable
match
nor
shan
alec
and
bride
the
girl
and
her
mother
were
fair
wild
with
delight
but
they
got
an
odious
disappointment
for
did
himself
run
the
poor
boy
out
of
the
house
i
surprised
at
you
says
the
wife
why
could
you
have
wit
and
give
that
decent
lad
an
honourable
reception
is
it
to
give
my
daughter
to
yon
country
coley
says
he
and
i
the
warmest
man
in
these
parts
a
better
match
for
her
like
is
walking
this
earth
says
the
wife
hold
your
whisht
woman
says
he
i
sooner
let
the
devil
have
her
than
see
her
join
the
world
with
shan
alec
what
is
on
you
at
all
to
be
speaking
such
foolishness
asks
herself
i
have
you
to
know
says
he
that
i
have
a
gentleman
for
my
and
no
common
person
at
all
it
is
the
raving
of
prosperity
is
on
you
says
she
and
that
is
the
worst
madness
out
speak
easy
says
he
or
maybe
i
correct
you
with
the
pot
stick
with
that
she
allowed
he
be
to
be
gone
daft
entirely
or
he
never
have
such
an
unseemly
thought
as
to
raise
his
hand
to
a
woman
hold
your
whisht
he
answers
surely
is
both
hand
and
foot
be
giving
you
unless
you
quit
tongueing
not
a
long
afterwards
a
splendid
gentleman
came
to
the
house
and
he
riding
on
a
horse
i
have
heard
tell
says
he
to
the
farmer
that
you
are
seeking
a
suitable
settlement
for
your
daughter
if
your
honour
wants
a
wife
says
himself
let
you
be
stepping
in
for
it
maybe
in
this
house
you
find
her
with
that
the
gentleman
got
down
off
his
horse
and
it
was
an
honourable
reception
they
made
him
evenly
herself
was
content
to
remember
the
scorn
put
on
poor
shan
alec
when
she
seen
the
magnificent
suitor
was
come
the
gentleman
had
a
smile
on
his
face
when
he
heard
all
the
boasts
of
the
farmer
my
good
man
says
he
i
think
scorn
on
your
money
and
land
for
i
have
you
to
know
that
i
am
a
king
in
my
own
place
but
that
girl
sitting
by
the
hearth
has
a
lovely
white
countenance
on
her
and
her
heart
i
am
seeking
for
love
of
the
same
oh

says
bride
in
a
whisper
will
you
send
him

it
raving

go
through
fire
and
water
for
my
poor
shan
alec
says
bride
will
you
hold
your
whisht
says
her
mother
that
is
no
right
talk
for
a
girl
the
farmer
and
the
gentleman
made
their
agreement
and
opened
the
bottle
of
whiskey
there
was
to
be
a
nice
little
feast
for
to
celebrate
the
settlement
and
the
cloth
was
set
in
the
parlour
on
account
of
the
grandeur
of
the
suitor
and
he
not
used
to
a
kitchen
at
all
when
the
supper
was
served
did
the
servant
girl
call
the
mistress
out
to
the
kitchen
oh
mam
says
she
i
could
get
word
with
you
in
private
before

you
hunt
that
lad
from
the
place
and
why

i
ask

herself
sure
how
would
he
be
a
right
gentleman
and
he
having
a
foot
on
him
like
a
horse
says
the
girl
with
that
the
mistress
began
to
lament
and
to
groan
what
i
do
what
i
do
and
i
scared
useless
with
dread

go
in
and
impeach

says
the
servant

in
she
went
to
the
parlour

she

place

master

from
the
room

under
the
table
at
your
lovely
gentleman
foot
says
she
the
farmer
done
as
she
bid
but
he
was
that
set
in
his
own
conceit
he
just
answers
what
harm
is
in
a
reel

no
ornament
surely
but
all
there
is
to
it

the
gentleman
i

the
devil
and
no
person
less

the
servant

skelp
with

pot
stick

the
devil
for

man

house

your
hand

the
woman
of
the
house
he
made
you
no
offer
of
his
bones

his
flesh

tongues
of
three
women

argue
the
devil
to
death
says
he
and
away
with
him
in
a
grey
puff
of
smoke
the
man
and
woman
of
the
house
began
for
to
pray
but
says

the
servant

slip
off
to
shan
alec
and
bid
him
come
up

maybe
an
honourable
reception

here
xiii
the
tillage
in
the
fort
there
was
a
man
in
these
parts
and
he
thought
it
hard
to
see
a
square
inch
of
ground
go
to
loss
he
had
a
small
wee
farm
on
the
top
of
a
windy
hill
and
there
was
a
fort
on
the
sweetest
of
the
fields
he
could
pass
by
but
he
think
of
how
much
potatoes
might
be
grown
within
in
the
circle
well
with
the
dint
of
consideration
did
he
finally
decide
for
to
plant
it
he
never
let
on
to
his
wife
but
away
out
with
the
loy
and
he
made
great
work
before
the
fall
of
night
when
he
came
in
he
carried
a
lengthy
thorn
root
in
his
hand
what
are
you
holding
asks
herself
an
old
thorn
i
hoked
out
of
the
ground
says
he
i
brought
it
in
for
the
fire
is
it
making
gaps
in
the
quick
hedges
you
are
she
asks
not
at
all
says
he
i
have
the
circle
beyond
rooted
up
for
to
set
potatoes
in
it
is
it
the
fort
says
she
when
she
heard
what
he
was
after
doing
she
began
for
to
roar
and
to
cry
it
is
destroyed
we
are
in
this
ill
hour
she
lamented
the
good
people
will
be
following
us
surely
with
the
black
wrath
of
vengeance
and
spite
never
before
did
i
hear
of
a
man
setting
spuds
in
a
fort
quit
raving
says
he
many
and
many
the
time
i
have
seen
them
they
riding
down
by
the
hill
their
fiddles
and
fifes
i
have
heard
their
shouts
and
their
laughs
but
i
had
no
cause
for
a
dread
till
it
come
on
me
now
she
replies
with
that
herself
took
the
thorn
from
the
fire
where
he
was
after
casting
it
down
she
left
it
out
on
the
door
of
the
house
let
their
branch
stop
beyond
on
the
street
says
she
the
way
they
will
not
be
entering
here
and
they
seeking
for
to
bring
it
away
in
the
black
darkness
of
midnight
there
came
the
awfullest
cry
on
the
street
on
past
the
house
and
into
the
byre
then
a
great
lamentation
came
from
the
cows
and
the
ass
the
creatures
are
a
killing
this
night
says
herself
the
man
rose
out
of
his
bed
and
he
kindled
a
light
he
had
the
heart
to
go
out
to
the
beasts
to
see
what
ailed
them
at
all
there
was
no
loss
on
the
cows
nor
the
ass
and
the
cry
and
the
shouting
were
gone
he
went
back
to
the
house
but
not
a
long
was
he
in
before
the
very
same
trouble
rose
in
the
byre
out
with
him
again
to
make
sure
what
was
wrong
and
he
found
not
a
single
heth
astray
he
was
back
in
his
bed
when
a
third
cry
passed
on
the
wind
the
ass
let
a
roar
was
more
nor
horrid
lonesome
and
the
cows
were
stamping
and
roaring
with
dread
all
the
while
there
was
nothing
in
it
when
the
master
went
out
there
was
no
sound
more
until
hard
on
the
break
of
day
a
laugh
that
was
hateful
to
hear
passed
the
house
and
a
hand
struck
hard
on
the
window
himself
rose
early
and
he
opened
the
door
what
did
he
see
only
the
ass
lying
dead
on
the
street
and
the
two
cows
were
destroyed
in
the
byre
was
the
fairies
surely
says
he
and
they
brought
this
destruction
upon
me
for
hoking
a
hole
in
their
farm
it
a
powerful
great
price
they
after
charging
you
for
the
hire
of
a
small
piece
of
ground
says
herself
coming
out
but
the
thorn
stick
is
gone
off
the
street
where
i
threw
it
last
night
and
if
that
had
remained
in
the
house
they
have
murdered
ourselves
xiv
the
new
deck
of
cards
of
all
the
contrivances
of
the
art
and
learning
of
man
there
is
none
more
curious
nor
cards
they
have
a
connection
with
beings
are
not
right
things
at
all
and
it
is
well
known
that
an
evil
angel
can
house
himself
for
a
while
in
a
new
deck
of
cards
there
was
a
young
lad
called
terry
the
luck
and
he
a
great
warrant
for
gaining
all
games
of
skill
and
of
chance
he
was
that
strongly
renowned
the
roulette
men
would
warn
him
away
from
their
boards
in
a
fair
and
the
thimble
trick
man
fled
clean
from
the
street
when
he
come
the
gosoons
were
in
dread
to
toss
pence
with
himself
for
the
coin
fell
head
or
tail
as
he
called
now
it
happened
one
night
that
terry
the
luck
was
on
his
way
home
from
the
sports
and
he
carried
a
new
deck
of
cards
in
his
hand
he
was
in
the
best
of
humour
for
he
was
after
winning
a
powerful
bet
on
a
race
part
of
the
gain
was
snug
in
his
pocket
and
the
remainder
had
paid
for
the
drink
of
his
friends
and
himself
the
road
to
his
home
was
lonely
for
he
lived
in
a
backward
townland
the
river
passed
within
sight
of
his
door
and
it
spanned
by
a
bridge
was
four
arches
long
when
terry
the
luck
set
his
foot
on
the
bridge
did
he
wheel
away
round
and
start
in
the
wrong
direction
that
a
strange
thing
says
he
sure
my
legs
were
right
steady
till
now
with
that
he
went
at
it
again
but
he
could
succeed
for
to
cross
he
went
back
about
twenty
yards
and
took
a
run
at
it
that
was
no
use
either
well
any
person
that
seen
his
antics
that
night
would
have
died
of
the
laughter
back
he
go
and
race
up
to
the
bridge
for
all
he
was
worth
but
whenever
his
foot
came
upon
it
he
turn
like
a
leaf
on
the
wind
and
away
to
where
he
started
from
what
was
more
nor
horrid
vexatious
for
the
poor
fellow
was
to
see
the
light
shining
in
his
own
kitchen
window
beyond
and
he
not
fit
to
get
home
is
enchanted
i
am
says
he
at
long
last
he
thought
of
the
new
deck
of
cards
and
he
laid
them
down
by
the
roadside
before
he
made
another
attempt
to
go
home
he
passed
the
bridge
without
the
least
hindrance
but
when
he
went
into
the
house
he
began
to
consider
it
was
all
a
foolishness
only
what
use
is
there
in
laying
out
money
for
cards
and
throwing
them
there
to
be
rotting
with
damp
says
he
back
he
went
across
the
river
to
fetch
the
new
deck
of
cards
but
if
he
was
to
strive
till
he
died
of
exhaustion
he
could
get
over
the
bridge
and
they
in
his
hand
i
lay
them
in
under
a
stone
until
dawn
says
he
maybe
whatever
is
in
them
will
quit
before
then
so
he
settled
his
cards
in
a
safe
hiding
hole
and
away
with
him
to
his
bed
he
rose
with
the
early
dawn
for
to
bring
out
the
deck
but
there
was
a
heth
to
be
found
where
he
stowed
it
away
and
the
earth
by
the
stone
was
all
burnt
into
ash
xv
the
lifting
of
a
child
there
was
a
woman
a
short
while
since
and
she
lived
on
a
snug
little
farm
convenient
to
the
lough
she
went
to
the
byre
for
to
milk
of
a
may
morning
and
no
person
stopped
in
the
house
only
a
young
child
in
the
cradle
not
a
long
was
herself
without
maybe
the
half
of
an
hour
and
when
she
came
in
there
was
no
appearance
of
any
disorder
or
strife
in
the
kitchen
but
the
poor
wee
child
lay
cold
and
dead
in
the
cradle
the
mother
began
for
to
roar
and
lament
and
her
heart
was
feeble
with
dread
there
came
a
knock
on
the
door
and
a
neighbouring
man
lifted
the
latch
and
walked
in
he
never
let
on
to
observe
the
woeful
countenance
of
herself
but
he
says
in
a
hearty
voice
will
you
tell
me
how
is
the
child
he
is
after
dying
on
us
she
answers
and
he
right
well
this
hour
past
the
man
went
over
to
the
cradle
and
he
lepped
three
foot
off
the
floor
when
he
seen
the
wee
corpse
lying
there
it
the
strangest
thing
at
all
she
laments
and
what
i
be
saying
to
himself
when
he
lands
in
from
his
work
let
you
be
telling
him
says
the
man
that
the
little
fellow
is
in
my
house
this
day
is
queer
advice
you
are
speaking
to
be
bidding
me
utter
the
like
of
yon
lie
forenenst
the
innocent
corpse
says
herself
not
a
lie
in
the
world
mam
he
answers
sure
i
am
just
after
leaving
your
child
by
my
own
kitchen
fire
and
he
wrapped
up
in
a
shawl
with
that
she
took
a
hold
of
the
pot
stick
for
to
run
him
from
the
place
she
was
odious
vexed
to
think
he
make
mock
of
her
sore
lamentations
you
the
ungrateful
besom
says
he
to
go
destroying
a
decent
neighbour
with
a
pot
stick
and
he
after
saving
your
son
from
the
power
of
the
good
people
let
you
tell
a
straight
story
or
quit
off
from
here
she
answers
for
i
am
heart
scalded
listening
to
your
old
nonsense
and
lies
is
striving
i
was
not
to
give
you
your
death
of
a
scare
says
he
but
the
strangest
thing
is
after
coming
to
pass
in
this
house
let
you
sit
down
and
have
good
courage
the
way
i
be
telling
you
a
rejoiceful
news
with
that
herself
brought
him
over
a
chair
dusting
it
clean
on
her
apron
then
she
pulled
up
the
creepy
and
sat
down
to
attend
to
his
words
did
you
hear
any
noise
of
disturbance
says
he
wherever
you
were
i
did
not
she
answers
and
not
a
far
was
i
from
this
place
at
all
i
went
to
the
byre
for
to
milk
and
no
noise
was
in
it
only
the
cow
breathing
and
the
splash
of
the
milk
in
the
can
that
more
nor
horrid
strange
says
he
for
i
was
passing
down
by
the
lough
and
i
heard
a
powerful
commotion
up
here
there
was
laughter
and
cheering
the
tramp
of
men
boots
on
the
street
and
horses
galloping
by
thinks
i
to
myself
fairies
are
out
contriving
some
old
villainy
this
morning
of
may
what
did
i
do
only
walk
up
among
them
and
i
seen
no
person
at
all
when
i
came
to
the
house
the
poor
wee
child
was
a
handing
out
on
the
window
but
i
could
not
behold
the
fairies
were
at
the
lifting
well
i
have
you
to
know
i
a
brave
and
venturesome
man
with
a
heart
as
strong
as
an
eagle
what
did
i
do
only
make
my
way
in
among
the
whole
throng
of
good
people
and
i
standing
on
their
feet
and
pushing
them
off
to
the
wall
to
make
space
for
myself
i
took
a
hold
of
the
child
for
to
pull
him
from
the
invisible
hands
were
lifting
him
out
and
as
sure
as
i
sitting
here
i
brought
him
safe
from
the
lot
there
went
a
whole
roar
of
annoyance
from
the
fairies
and
they
mounted
up
on
their
horses
and
away
but
i
brought
the
little
fellow
to
my
own
house
for
fear
they
return
for
him
to
this
place
the
poor
mother
was
wild
with
delight
to
hear
tell
the
son
was
alive
let
be
going
to
fetch
him
says
she
and
he
never
be
left
in
the
house
by
his
lone
from
this
out
the
two
went
down
to
the
neighbour
house
and
sure
enough
the
child
was
in
it
asleep
by
the
fire
the
man
had
to
carry
him
home
for
herself
was
exhausted
with
fright
maybe
the
good
people
are
gone
up
to
remove
what
they
left
in
the
cradle
says
she
but
when
they
went
into
the
kitchen
was
the
old
corpse
in
it
yet
we
be
to
bury
yon
article
says
herself
but
the
man
allowed
there
was
no
need
to
be
treating
the
like
the
same
as
a
right
thing
throw
it
in
on
the
back
of
the
fire
says
he
herself
was
in
dread
to
lay
her
hand
on
the
likeness
of
the
child
so
the
man
lifted
it
out
of
the
cradle
and
threw
it
down
on
the
fire
and
it
blazed
away
up
the
chimney
for
a
second
time
and
departed
in
a
puff
of
smoke
xvi
the
voice
at
the
door
there
was
one
time
a
poor
widow
woman
he
name
of
cathleen
the
hollow
for
her
house
was
down
in
a
dip
of
the
ground
she
had
two
fine
beautiful
sons
shan
the
hollow
and
hughie
cathleen
shan
was
a
dancer
could
step
on
a
plate
and
not
put
a
break
in
the
delf
and
hughie
could
sing
every
ballad
and
song
was
ever
heard
tell
of
at
all
they
were
wild
daring
lads
too
the
way
there
was
great
talk
of
them
in
the
countryside
and
the
lamentations
of
the
youth
of
the
world
were
more
nor
a
fright
when
news
came
round
to
the
neighbours
that
hughie
was
dead
he
lay
down
of
a
friday
night
and
he
in
the
best
of
health
on
the
saturday
morning
the
brother
went
to
rouse
him
and
found
him
perished
dead
well
there
was
a
most
elegant
wake
not
a
one
in
those
parts
but
paid
respect
to
the
corpse
and
there
was
the
least
suspicion
but
that
hughie
come
by
his
death
of
some
natural
cause
it
was
maybe
a
fortnight
after
the
burying
that
the
sleep
quit
shan
the
hollow
entirely
if
evenly
he
began
for
to
doze
in
his
bed
be
roused
up
again
by
a
rap
on
the
door
but
when
he
stepped
out
there
was
no
person
visible
there
oh
mother
says
he
i
thinking
poor
hughie
is
walking
the
world
he
is
not
says
she
for
he
was
a
decent
lad
would
find
peace
in
the
grave
but
there
is
some
person
making
free
with
this
house
for
not
a
day
goes
by
but
i
miss
some
article
of
food
shan
let
it
be
but
his
mind
was
uneasy
for
hugh
and
not
a
long
after
he
heard
a
voice
go
past
in
the
night
and
it
singing
a
beautiful
song
he
rose
and
he
went
to
the
door
oh
hughie
says
he
is
that

spirit

the
earth
it
myself
is
walking
the
world
and

the
voice
the
good
people

me
away
and
the
corpse
was
an
old
image
cut
from
bog
stick
that
they
left
in
my
bed
to
deceive
you
then
it

using
the
food
from
this
house
my
poor
boy
says
shan
aye

the
voice
and
sometimes
it
little
i
find
it
does
be
hard
on
me
to
refuse
the
noble
refreshment
the
fairies
set
out
but
if
i
eat
of
the
like
i
could
never
escape
from
their
power
do
you
tell
herself
to
leave
me
a
mug
of
sweet
milk
and
a
morsel
of
bread
on
the
sill
of
the
window
to
keep
me
from
hungering

street
singing
till

sound
dwined
out
in
the
distance
but
my
poor
shan
was
that
put
about
he
could
decide
what
to
do
at
the
dawn
of
the
morning
he
set
off
to
visit
the
priest
and
he
informed
him
every
word
he
was
after
hearing
well
his
reverence
could
believe
there
was
anything
in
it
only
a
dream
of
the
night
let
your
reverence
go
to
the
cassidy
and
keep
herself
from
their
hands
says
shan
for
the
good
people
are
determined
to
lift
her
away
go
home
now
and
attend
to
your
farm
says
the
priest
is
the
raving
of
grief
is
on
you
for
the
brother
you
lost
still
and
all
his
reverence
set
out
for
cassidy
that
evening
to
see
was
anything
wrong
did
he
find
the
good
people
before
him
and
they
had
herself
brought
away
oh
if
only
i
had
come
in
time
says
he
but
i
might
be
some
hindrance
to
them
yet
with
that
he
went
down
to
the
hollow
and
shan
was
sitting
within
in
the
house
says
the
priest
let
you
not
stir
from
this
for
the
calling
of
voices
that
pass
you
are
after
informing
me
of
an
intention
you
have
for
to
rescue
your
brother
on
a
set
and
certain
night
now
give
me
your
promise
to
make
no
attempt
of
the
sort
for
it
into
the
power
of
the
fallen
angels
you
go
and
you
not
get
him
rescued
at
all
i
be
to
make
an
offer
anyway
says
shan
very
well
says
the
priest
i
send
four
strong
men
of
this
parish
to
rope
you
down
in
your
bed
on
that
ill
night
did
they
hold
my
poor
shan
from
his
offer
to
bring
home
the
brother
and
surely
it
was
well
done
for
his
own
destruction
was
in
it
but
the
voice
came
no
more
to
the
window
and
the
bread
lay
uncut
on
the
sill
xvii
the
earl
son
of
the
sea
when
the
good
people
fell
from
the
heavens
above
did
some
of
them
sink
in
the
sea
and
there
they
are
dwelling
this
day
many
and
many
a
story
is
told
of
their
diversions
and
how
they
be
wrecking
the
ships
but
the
strangest
account
i
ever
heard
tell
was
the
fisherman
daughter
that
met
the
earl
son
of
the
sea
she
was
travelling
the
sands
by
her
lone
on
the
west
coast
of
ireland
and
when
she
came
near
to
the
rocks
she
heard
the
notes
of
a
harp
of
course
she
was
curious
to
know
who
was
out
playing
in
that
place
and
no
dwelling
near
so
over
she
went
towards
the
sound
and
what
did
she
come
on
only
a
beautiful
man
it
destroyed
in
a
short
space
you
be
she
calls
out
for
the
tide
is
beginning
to
rise
and
you
be
dashed
dead
on
the
rocks
do
you
know
who
i
am
says
he
i
do
not
she
answers
but
you
surely
a
stranger
to
these
parts
or
you
would
sit
there
with
the
waves
beginning
to
rise
maybe
i
travelled
this
bay
before
you
were
born
says
he
with
that
she
let
a
laugh
out
of
her
i
thinking
the
two
of
us
are
about
the
one
age
says
she
so
quit
your
talk
and
come
on
out
of
that
till
i
show
you
the
way
up
the
cliff
you
a
beautiful
girl
says
the
stranger
and
the
wish
is
on
me
to
please
you
climb
up
out
of
reach
of
the
rising
sea
and
i
play
you
a
tune
on
the
harp
well
she
travelled
back
over
the
sand
and
up
by
the
path
to
the
cliff
never
doubting
but
the
stranger
was
following
on
but
when
she
looked
down
she
seen
him
below
on
the
rock
it
is
drownded
you
be
she
calls
out
let
you
not
be
uneasy
says
he
with
that
he
began
for
to
play
on
the
harp
and
the
music
enchanted
the
fisherman
child
and
the
tears
ran
down
from
her
eyes
when
she
looked
again
to
the
rock
was
the
stranger
washed
from
it
and
a
big
white
wave
curled
up
from
the
place
i
after
finding
and
losing
a
beautiful
boy
says
she
and
she
went
away
home
lamenting
his
death
not
a
long
after
she
was
travelling
the
sands
and
she
heard
the
music
again
there
was
himself
sitting
up
on
the
rock
as
sound
as
a
salmon
at
play
i
doubt
you
no
right
thing
says
she
maybe
not
he
allows
but
i
rise
your
heart
with
a
tune
if
it
was
crying
i
had
you
the
last
time
it
laughing
i
see
you
this
day
with
that
he
played
the
cleverest
dancing
tune
on
the
harp
and
he
had
the
fisherman
daughter
in
the
best
of
humour
after
a
while
he
says
i
thinking
you
have
a
poor
way
of
living
in
your
home
for
it
hard
set
to
earn
a
bit
and
a
sup
that
the
fishermen
are
in
this
place
we
miserable
surely
she
answers
i
be
making
you
a
great
advancement
says
he
for
i
have
you
to
know
that
there
plenty
of
wealth
in
my
power
let
you
quit
from
your
own
friends
and
marry
myself
it
a
beautiful
castle
build
you
out
on
a
rock
in
the
ocean
and
jewels
and
pearls
for
your
portion
to
wear
a
lonesome
life
says
she
to
be
watching
the
wild
birds
fly
over
the
waves
and
maybe
a
ship
passing
by
moreover
you
are
no
right
thing
evenly
if
you
have
the
appearance
of
a
beautiful
gentleman
a
poor
man
of
these
parts
will
join
the
world
with
myself
sure
i
an
earl
son
of
the
sea
he
allows
but
the
grandeur
did
tempt
her
at
all
a
sea
marriage
would
be
no
marriage
she
answers
and
with
that
she
bid
him
let
your
man
never
travel
the
sea
he
answers
for
i
destroy
the
ship
from
under
his
feet
and
leave
him
dead
on
a
wave
he
lepped
down
into
the
water
and
away
with
him
from
out
of
her
sight
the
fisherman
daughter
never
heard
him
out
harping
again
nor
seen
a
sight
of
his
face
and
after
a
while
she
forgot
the
queer
lad
entirely
did
she
marry
a
farmer
inland
and
it
was
a
comfortable
life
they
enjoyed
but
a
notion
took
himself
that
he
prosper
more
in
the
states
for
he
was
greedy
for
gold
he
took
passage
for
the
two
on
a
great
big
ship
and
away
with
them
from
ireland
not
a
long
were
they
at
sea
before
a
sudden
furl
blast
met
the
ship
and
a
wave
twenty
times
as
high
as
a
house
stood
up
over
the
deck
and
broke
down
every
person
was
killed
dead
and
smashed
into
the
wood
of
the
ship
only
the
fisherman
daughter
she
felt
the
vessel
sink
down
from
under
her
and
she
looked
up
and
seen
a
beautiful
castle
rise
up
on
a
rock
on
the
sea
the
earl
son
came
past
on
a
wave
and
he
lifted
her
up
by
the
hair
of
her
head
for
to
land
her
out
on
the
rock
the
fisherman
daughter
lived
in
that
place
for
fourteen
years
and
she
lamenting
the
lonesome
hours
of
each
day
she
seen
the
wild
gulls
flying
and
whales
and
every
sort
sailing
the
waves
she
took
no
delight
in
the
jewels
nor
the
dresses
were
stored
in
that
house
and
the
earl
son
of
the
sea
allowed
she
grew
ugly
and
old
it
happened
one
day
he
was
travelling
in
other
parts
that
herself
seen
a
ship
coming
down
and
she
waved
a
white
flag
out
the
window
a
man
came
out
from
the
ship
in
a
small
little
boat
and
who
was
it
only
her
own
brother
michael
oh
sister
dear
says
he
is
it
sitting
on
a
rock
you
are
for
fourteen
weary
years
sure
we
heard
tell
of
the
loss
of
the
vessel
was
bringing
you
out
to
the
states
it
a
fine
castle
is
here
says
she
but
it
lonesome
i
am
for
my
home
i
see
no
more
nor
a
rock
and
it
green
with
the
weed
of
the
sea
says
michael
it
on
your
eyes
that
there
more
in
it
for
i
see
nothing
at
all
with
that
she
told
him
the
whole
story
and
he
was
in
dread
for
to
bring
her
away
lest
the
earl
son
might
destroy
them
i
tell
you
what
i
do
says
he
it
back
to
ireland
sail
and
i
get
an
image
made
the
down
likeness
of
yourself
when
we
set
that
up
on
the
rock
himself
will
believe
you
are
in
it
and
we
may
get
away
so
he
rowed
his
wee
boat
to
the
ship
and
home
he
sailed
to
ireland
he
got
the
finest
image
made
and
it
the
dead
spit
of
herself
with
that
in
his
keeping
he
travelled
the
sea
till
he
came
to
the
rock
and
his
sister
still
sat
there
lamenting
but
she
had
a
red
flag
hung
out
and
that
was
the
sign
they
agreed
for
him
not
to
come
near
so
he
be
to
wait
until
she
put
up
a
white
one
and
then
he
knew
that
the
earl
son
was
not
near
he
got
her
safe
to
the
boat
and
they
left
the
old
image
stuck
up
on
the
rock
there
two
little
fellows
like
he
left
to
watch
when
he
gone
says
herself
but
they
did
see
me
slip
out
and
never
think
but
the
statue
is
me
i
have
the
least
fear
of
them
bringing
him
word
there
is
anything
wrong
but
if
he
returns
we
are
lost
for
he
wo
be
that
easy
deceived
they
made
great
sailing
to
ireland
and
the
ship
was
coming
in
on
the
harbour
the
way
they
were
sure
they
come
safe
what
did
they
see
only
the
earl
son
and
he
riding
on
a
big
white
wave
to
catch
up
to
them
the
image
was
with
him
and
he
threw
it
after
the
ship
the
way
a
hole
was
cleft
in
her
side
and
she
sank
but
the
daughter
her
brother
and
the
sailors
got
on
shore
in
a
boat
before
he
came
at
them
again
they
seen
him
from
the
shore
and
he
flittering
something
with
his
two
hands
what
was
it
only
the
and
he
threw
the
bits
of
them
up
on
the
shore
he
came
in
himself
but
they
pelted
him
from
it
with
stones
for
his
power
was
lost
on
the
land
but
not
a
one
of
that
family
to
this
present
day
may
venture
into
the
waves
for
the
earl
son
watches
out
to
destroy
them
for
vengeance
and
spite
xviii
the
girl
and
the
fairies
there
was
a
beautiful
young
girl
living
in
these
parts
and
she
was
greatly
admired
by
every
person
that
seen
her
it
happened
when
she
was
about
nineteen
years
of
age
that
she
fainted
one
day
on
the
street
before
the
house
where
she
was
washing
the
spuds
for
dinner
the
mother
and
sister
went
out
for
to
carry
her
in
and
they
laid
her
down
on
the
bed
the
poor
girl
never
rose
from
it
more
maybe
a
week
she
was
lingering
dying
not
a
word
ever
came
from
her
lips
and
she
used
no
food
at
all
not
a
long
after
the
burying
her
mother
heard
a
rapping
on
the
window
close
upon
midnight
she
rose
and
she
says
oh
bridget
dear
is
it
you
it
is
indeed
mamma
says
a
voice
let
you
give
me
a
drink
of
sweet
milk
and
a
small
taste
of
bread
i
heard
tell
of
the
dead
were
uneasy
but
never
of
one
needing
food
says
the
mother
the
fairies
have
me
away
answers
bridget
is
myself
is
living
this
day
and
you
are
after
giving
decent
burial
to
an
old
thing
they
left
in
my
place
with
that
the
poor
mother
brought
milk
and
bread
to
the
window
and
handed
it
out
will
you
ever
contrive
to
get
home
my
poor
bridget
says
she
aye
surely
answers
the
girl
if
the
men
of
this
place
are
worthy
their
keep
let
you
make
inquiries
among
them
until
you
find
two
strong
daring
boys
are
willing
to
attempt
my
rescue
she
went
away
off
the
street
and
the
mother
went
back
to
her
bed
the
next
evening
there
were
some
of
the
neighbours
came
in
and
herself
gave
out
all
she
was
after
hearing
there
were
two
clever
lads
in
it
and
they
promised
for
to
bring
the
girl
snug
and
safe
to
her
home
not
a
long
after
bridget
came
back
to
the
window
to
speak
with
the
mother
so
when
she
heard
of
the
offer
was
made
she
says
the
good
people
are
going
away
over
the
moor
on
wednesday
night
and
i
must
journey
with
them
it
is
mounted
on
horses
we
be
and
tell
the
two
lads
i
told
them
to
stand
by
the
gap
and
watch
for
the
squad
going
through
i
be
upon
the
third
grey
horse
to
go
by
and
let
the
two
lads
take
a
hold
of
me
one
at
each
side
now
if
not
full
sure
they
have
courage
and
daring
to
hold
their
hold
let
them
not
come
near
me
at
all
for
if
i
pass
on
with
the
fairies
they
kill
me
dead
for
vengeance
that
night
the
mother
promised
she
give
the
lads
great
warning
to
keep
their
hold
and
do
all
as
bridget
was
saying
well
on
the
wednesday
night
the
venturesome
lads
went
down
to
the
gap
of
the
fort
field
and
there
they
stood
waiting
one
at
each
side
of
the
pass
not
a
long
were
they
in
it
before
the
good
people
began
to
go
through
one
grey
horse
went
down
beside
another
and
a
third
came
behind
with
bridget
sitting
upon
his
back
the
two
lads
caught
a
hold
of
her
but
did
the
horse
let
a
stag
lep
and
they
lost
their
grip
on
the
girl
she
gave
the
lonesomest
cry
as
she
was
carried
from
them
and
the
fairies
began
for
to
cheer
and
to
laugh
we
follow
the
good
people
on
says
one
of
the
boys
and
maybe
we
vanquish
them
yet
so
the
two
travelled
after
the
riders
away
towards
the
moor
the
river
flows
convenient
to
that
place
and
a
fine
bridge
spans
it
across
it
was
there
that
the
awfullest
cry
rose
out
of
the
throng
of
the
fairies
and
when
the
boys
came
on
to
the
bridge
they
seen
it
all
red
with
my
poor
bridget
blood
the
horsemen
were
after
dashing
her
down
on
the
stones
to
her
death
xix
my
brave
michael
there
was
a
big
gathering
of
neighbours
sitting
round
a
fire
telling
stories
of
an
evening
and
some
person
says
there
the
strongest
bolt
and
lock
in
all
ireland
on
the
door
there
beyond
and
it
could
be
broken
at
all
with
that
the
good
people
were
listening
outside
began
for
to
laugh
did
they
whip
the
lock
off
the
door
and
away
with
them
through
the
fields
says
the
man
of
the
house
i
thinking
there
danger
abroad
let
the
lot
of
you
stop
here
till
dawn
but
there
was
a
big
venturesome
man
in
it
and
he
allowed
he
go
home
no
spite
of
the
fairies
he
started
off
by
his
lone
and
he
had
a
wet
sort
of
field
to
pass
through
with
a
great
shaking
scraw
to
one
side
it
was
an
awful
and
dangerous
place
to
any
person
not
used
to
the
like
but
he
knew
his
way
by
the
pass
he
was
travelling
at
a
good
speed
when
all
on
a
sudden
he
heard
the
tramping
of
a
score
of
horses
behind
him
then
they
came
up
round
himself
but
he
seen
no
person
at
all
nor
a
sign
of
a
horse
or
an
ass
the
fairies
are
in
it
says
he
with
that
one
of
them
took
a
hold
of
him
by
the
collar
and
turned
him
round
on
the
path
my
brave
michael
says
the
horsemen
then
another
of
them
took
him
by
the
shoulder
and
faced
him
away
round
again
my
brave
michael
says
he
well
the
whole
score
of
fairies
kept
turning
him
round
until
he
seen
the
stars
dropping
down
from
the
sky
and
his
ears
were
deafened
with
a
sound
like
the
sea
and
every
one
that
took
him
by
the
shoulder
would
say
my
brave
michael
the
poor
fellow
did
know
what
in
under
the
shining
heaven
was
he
to
do
he
seen
they
were
setting
him
astray
but
he
could
continue
for
to
keep
on
the
path
and
he
was
in
odious
dread
they
furl
him
into
the
shaking
scraw
where
he
sink
from
the
sight
of
man
a
sudden
thought
struck
his
mind
of
a
saying
he
heard
from
his
ma
he
whipped
the
coat
off
his
back
and
he
put
it
on
with
the
wrong
side
turned
out
and
then
he
found
he
was
standing
alone
in
the
field
on
the
edge
of
the
scraw
and
no
person
near
him
at
all
so
he
went
away
home
without
any
mishap
but
indeed
he
was
trembling
with
dread
xx
the
lad
and
the
old
lassie
song
there
was
a
young
lad
living
in
these
parts
not
long
since
at
all
and
his
name
was
francis
john
it
chanced
of
a
may
morning
that
water
was
scarce
for
the
tea
the
way
his
mother
put
a
bucket
in
his
hand
and
hunted
him
off
to
the
spring
now
an
old
lassie
lived
by
her
lone
in
a
little
wee
house
was
built
right
close
to
the
path
the
door
stood
open
that
morning
and
my
brave
francis
john
looked
in
when
he
went
on
his
way
to
the
well
he
seen
the
old
girl
sitting
on
a
small
creepy
stool
by
the
fire
with
a
row
of
clay
images
baking
in
front
of
the
turf
was
she
singing
a
song
and
a
queer
cracked
voice
was
her
own
every
word
of
it
came
good
and
plain
to
the
ears
of
the
lad
ye
that
i
bake
before
the
fire
bring
me
the
milk
from
my
neighbour
byre

the
butter
from
off
the
churn
and
set
it
forenenst
me
before
you
burn
francis
john
did
ask
to
disturb
her
diversions
at
all
so
he
went
on
his
way
and
filled
up
his
can
at
the
spring
but
all
the
road
home
the
old
lassie
song
tormented
his
mind
and
as
he
came
in
at
the
door
he
began
for
to
sing
ye
that
she
bakes
before
the
fire
bring
me
the
milk
from
the
neighbour
byre
gather
the
butter
from

and
set
it
forenenst
me
before
you
burn
with
the
power
of
the
words
coming
from
him
did
the
boots
on
his
feet
fill
up
with
sweet
milk
and
it
running
out
on
the
lace
holes
man
but
that
an
enchanted
song
says
he
and
what
did
he
do
only
step
into
four
pounds
of
butter
that
fell
on
the
threshold
before
him
for
he
never
remarked
it
at
all
xxi
the
basket
of
eggs
there
was
a
woman
one
time
and
she
on
her
way
to
the
market
counting
the
price
of
her
basket
of
eggs
if
eggs
are
up
says
she
i
be
gaining
a
handful
of
silver
and
evenly
if
prices
be
down
i
not
do
too
badly
at
all
for
i
have
a
weighty
supply
with
that
she
remarked
a
little
wee
boy
sitting
down
by
the
hedge
he
stitching
away
at
a
brogue
if
i
had
a
hold
of
yon
lad

she
i
make
him
discover
a
treasure
for
the
like
of
him
knows
where
gold
does
be
hid
she
juked
up
behind
him
like
a
cat
would
be
after
a
bird
and
she
caught
a
strong
grip
of
his
neck
well
he
let
an
odious
screech
out
of
him
for
he
was
horrid
surprised
i
have
you
my
gosoon
says
she
oh
surely

have
mam
he
answers
the
strength
of
your
thumb

destroying
my
thrapple
this
day
will
you
show
me
a
treasure
says
she
i
have
you
to
know
he
replies
that
the
pot
of
gold
i
could
convey
you
in
sight
of
is
guarded
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
strange
frog
what
do
i
care
for
the
creeping
beasts
of
the
world
says
she
worse
nor
a
frog
would
scare
me
at
all
you
a
terrible
fine
woman
mistress

says
the
leprachaun
i
travelled
a
power
of
the
earth
and
i
never
came
in
with
your
equal
go
on
with
your
chat
she
replies
but
she
was
middling
well
pleased
all
the
same
i
a
small
little
fellow
says
he
and
i
could
keep
up
with
yourself
but
it
light
in
the
body
i
am
the
way
i
be
never
a
burden
at
all
and
i
sitting
up
on
the
handle
of
the
basket
up
with
you
she
answers
for
i
soon
put
you
down
to
walk
by
my
side
if
you
are
not
speaking
the
truth
but
she
did
find
the
least
burden
more
on
the
basket
when
himself
was
on
the
handle
he
was
a
great
warrant
to
flatter
and
he
had
her
in
humour
that
day
all
the
while
he
was
watching
out
for
a
chance
to
escape
but
she
kept
a
hold
of
his
ear
what
did
he
do
only
put
his
two
wee
hands
down
into
the
basket
and
he
began
for
to
bail
out
the
eggs
she
fetched
him
a
terrible
clout
but
the
harder
she
beat
him
the
faster
he
threw
out
the
eggs
oh
mam
oh
mam
says
he
what
for
are
you
skelping
my
head
to
make
you
quit
breaking
my
eggs
you
unmannerly
coley
says
she
sure
it
doing
you
favour
i
am

replies
i
have
you
to
know
when
i
spill
an
egg
on
the
ground
a
spring
chicken
leps
out

raving
says
she
if
you
doubt
my
word
he
makes
answer
let
you
turn
and
look
back
at
the
chickens
are
flocking
along
with
that
she
turned
her
head
and
the
leprachaun
slipped
from
her
grasp
he
made
one
spring
from
the
basket
into
the
hedge
and
he
vanished
away
from
the
place
the
wee
lad
has
fooled
me
entirely
says
she
and
my
beautiful
eggs
are
destroyed
but
i
am
the
finest
woman
he
seen
and
that
is
a
good
thing
to
know

the
broken
branch
there
was
a
man
in
the
olden
time
and
he
owned
a
snug
little
farm
what
did
he
do
of
a
winter
day
only
break
a
great
branch
off
a
lone
bush
for
to
burn
in
the
fire
a
thorn
went
into
his
hand
and
it
pierced
it
through
that
was
a
sore
jag
says
he
but
there
was
a
little
grey
woman
sitting
in
under
the
lone
bush
and
she
let
a
terrible
laugh
there
were
two
of
the
neighbours
seen
what
occurred
and
they
passing
down
through
the
field
one
of
them
ran
away
home
but
the
other
a
venturesome
lad
came
across
what
are
you
after
doing
my
poor
fellow
says
he
i
am
after
destroying
my
hand
with
a
thorn
says
the
man
the
neighbour
allowed
there
was
worse
in
it
nor
that
did
you
hear
the
grey
woman
laugh
he
inquires
there
is
no
woman
here
says
the
other
i
seen
her
a
while
past
and
i
coming
down
to
your
side
she
was
sitting
in
under
the
bush
but
now
she
is
gone
when
you
drove
the
thorn
through
your
hand
she
let
a
lamentable
laugh
that
was
worse
nor
a
cry
the
man
did
believe
it
at
all
but
the
jag
in
his
hand
festered
up
and
he
died
for
breaking
the
branch
of
the
thorn

digging
for
gold
in
the
ancient
times
a
poor
decent
labouring
man
dreamt
three
nights
of
finding
a
kist
was
hid
in
the
fort
near
his
home
so
away
there
he
went
for
to
dig
and
not
long
was
he
working
at
all
when
he
came
on
the
beautiful
gold
in
troth
i
am
rich
from
this
out
he
calls
at
the
height
of
his
voice
with
that
the
whole
treasure
fell
down
through
the
earth
he
should
not
have
spoken
at
all
then
there
came
a
powerful
great
cat
and
it
was
the
guard
of
the
kist
now
the
man
had
the
wit
to
take
hold
of
the
appearance
before
him
and
let
it
strive
never
so
hard
it
could
not
contrive
to
escape
i
hold
you
says
he
till
you
tell
me
where
is
the
gold
dig
at
the
far
side
says
a
voice
but
whether
it
came
from
the
cat
was
past
the
man
wit
for
to
know
well
he
went
over
and
began
for
to
dig
at
the
far
side
and
he
came
on
a
big
copper
pot
but
no
gold
was
in
it
at

xxiv
story
of
a
churn
there
was
a
woman
renowned
for
making
the
best
of
good
butter
now
it
chanced
in
the
spring
that
her
man
had
three
boys
hired
for
to
work
at
the
setting
of
spuds
one
morning
they
passed
through
the
house
when
the
churn
was
a
making
and
not
one
put
his
hand
to
the
work
nor
uttered
a
blessing
upon
it
herself
was
horrid
annoyed
to
think
they
be
that
unseemly
and
ignorant
yet
she
passed
no
remark
of
the
sort
did
her
whole
morning
work
go
to
loss
for
no
yield
come
on
the
churn
she
was
not
very
great
with
her
neighbours
and
the
first
time
she
chanced
for
to
speak
of
what
happened
that
day
was
next
time
she
seen
her
own
mother
the
old
woman
says
if
you
have
one
of
them
three
lads
impeached
for
taking
the
yield
from
the
churn
let
you
write
his
name
backwards
on
a
small
slip
of
paper
and
burn
it
in
a
shovel
over
the
fire
what
good
that
be
asks
the
daughter
it
will
be
the
means
of
restoring
the
butter
was
lifted
away
says
the
mother
i
doubt
not
and
it
two
months
and
more
since
the
loss
says
the
young
woman
but
she
brought
out
the
paper
and
ink
for
to
write
down
the
name
of
the
lad
she
impeached
she
set
it
down
backwards
and
burnt
it
over
the
fire
now
says
the
mother
go
out
to
the
churn
what
did
she
find
only
five
pounds
of
butter
sitting
within
on

dry
wood
xxv
the
gankeynogue
in
the
oak
chest
there
was
once
a
man
of
these
parts
and
he
had
a
great
longing
for
to
find
a
treasure
it
chanced
one
evening
that
he
seen
a
gankeynogue
in
the
field
sitting
in
under
a
bush
and
he
says
yon
lad
will
surely
be
worth
a
powerful
weight
of
gold
with
that
he
went
over
and
caught
a
hold
of
the
gankey
let
you
discover
a
treasure
says
he
or
else
i
keep
you
like
a
dog
on
a
chain
from
this
out
keep
away
says
the
gankey
how
would
a
poor
creature
like
myself
be
finding
treasure
for
a
strong
farmer
let
you
not
let
on
to
be
miserable
says
the
man
for
well
i
know
it
great
wealth
you
enjoy
is
it
me
says
the
gankeynogue
sure
i
support
a
lengthy
family
entirely
by
my
own
industry
but
the
farmer
would
not
believe
a
word
of
the
sort
he
carried
the
gankey
to
his
house
and
put
him
into
a
big
oak
chest
you
never
get
out
except
for
to
show
me
where
treasure
is
lodged
he
allows
but
the
gankeynogue
was
in
notion
of
giving
the
least
information
he
sat
up
in
the
oak
chest
hammering
shouting
and
singing
until
he
had
the
people
heads
light
all
the
while
the
farmer
was
determined
to
get
the
better
of
him
and
he
never
agreed
to
let
him
go
the
lad
was
his
tenth
day
in
the
chest
when
the
man
of
the
house
came
running
in
that
evening
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
darragh
fort
on
fire
darragh
fort
on
fire
with
that
the
gankey
began
the
most
woeful
lamentations
and
he
hammering
like
mad
to
get
out
of
the
chest
what
ails
you
at
all
asks
the
farmer
my
wife
and
family
are
in
that
place
says
the
gankey
let
me
away
to
bring
them
safe
from
the
fire
will
you
show
me
a
treasure
asks
the
man
aye
surely
says
the
gankeynogue
but
let
go
first
to
darragh
fort
to
save
my
weak
family
and
then
i
bestow
the
treasure
so
the
two
started
off
for
darragh
fort
and
it
not
on
fire
at
all
that
was
a
story
the
man
was
after
inventing
for
to
scare
the
gankeynogue
when
they
landed
in
sight
of
the
place
the
man
allowed
the
fire
be
to
have
burnt
out
did
the
gankey
make
a
run
and
lep
in
among
the
trees
i
safe
from
you
now
says
he
but
the
man
never
let
on
to
be
vexed
that
he
could
see
the
lad
any
more
he
listened
to
his
voice
speaking
for
to
know
the
direction
he
went
then
he
lay
down
in
that
part
of
the
fort
and
let
on
to
be
asleep
after
a
while
he
heard
the
gankeynogue
telling
his
wife
about
how
he
was
kept
in
the
chest
i
was
ten
days
in
that
place
says
he
and
i
full
of
venom
against
the
farmer
but
it
the
cunning
lad
i
am
for
i
never
let
on
where
the
treasure
is
buried
at
all
where
is
it
asks
the
gankeynogue
wife
under
a
stone
in
the
street
before
his
house
says
the
gankey
and
herself
tripped
and
spilled
a
bucket
of
milk
just
over
the
place
this
morning
i
was
looking
out
on
a
hole
in
the
chest
and
still
i
never
let
on
one
word
when
i
seen
what
happened
you
a
wise
little
fellow
sure
enough
says
his
wife
the
farmer
got
up
and
away
home
with
him
after
hearing
what
they
said
he
asked
herself
where
she
spilled
the
milk
at
the
morning
of
the
day
by
that
stone
says
she
setting
her
foot
on
a
flag
in
the
street
he
brought
the
loy
and
a
crowbar
for
to
hoke
up
the
place
and
he
discover
a
beautiful
treasure
of
gold
xxvi
the
maker
of
brogues
there
was
a
young
lad
travelling
the
road
to
a
fair
and
he
passed
convenient
to
a
field
had
a
sand
pit
in
the
middle
of
it
what
did
he
see
sitting
up
in
that
place
with
his
legs
dangling
over
the
edge
of
the
pit
only
a
little
wee
man
making
brogues
the
lad
took
one
lep
into
the
field
and
he
walked
up
to
the
cobbler
mister
says
he
might
i
make
so
bold
as
to
ask
what
work
you
are
doing
this
hour
of
the
morning
dew
and
what
makes
you
fancy
the
edge
of
a
pit
for
a
seat
is
making
brogues
i
am
says
the
leprachaun
and
they
for
the
good
people
wear
i
thinking
you
watching
a
treasure
says
the
lad
i
not
says
the
leprachaun
but
i
know
where
there
plenty
hid
you
be
to
discover
it
for
me
says
the
lad
let
you
wait
till
this
one
pair
of
brogues
is
made
says
the
fairy
so
the
lad
agreed
and
he
sat
down
to
watch
him
at
work
begob
says
he
i
never
seen
any
person
could
hammer
in
nails
such
a
rate
it
a
slow
worker
i
counted
in
these
parts
says
the
leprachaun
let
you
look
down
into
the
pit
at
the
man
is
cobbling
below
i
warrant
it
three
nails
he
driving
for
each
one
of
mine
the
lad
looked
over
the
edge
there
is
no
man
in
it
at
all
says
he
with
that
the
leprachaun
let
a
laugh
there
is
not
says
he
there
a
sore
chastisement
waiting
on
you
for
deceiving
me
answers
the
other
but
when
he
stood
on
his
feet
and
looked
round
was
the
leprachaun
gone
i
the
fool
of
the
whole
wide
world
says
the
lad
and
he
travelled
away
to
the
fair
glossary
a
