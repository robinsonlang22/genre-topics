preface
repeatedly
since
returning
to
the
united
states
people
have
asked
me
why
do
you
write
a
book
on
korea
i
have
invariably
replied
that
it
was
not
necessary
and
referred
the
inquirers
to
the
large
work
of
griffis
entitled
corea
the
hermit
kingdom
which
covers
the
subject
in
a
charming
manner
my
object
in
writing
this
book
was
to
correct
the
erroneous
impressions
i
have
found
somewhat
prevalent
that
the
koreans
were
a
people
and
believing
that
the
object
could
be
accomplished
best
in
displaying
the
thought
life
and
habits
of
the
people
as
portrayed
in
their
native
lore
i
have
made
these
translations
which
while
they
are
so
chosen
as
to
cover
various
phases
of
life
are
not
to
be
considered
as
especially
selected
i
also
wished
to
have
some
means
of
answering
the
constant
inquiries
from
all
parts
of
the
country
concerning
korean
life
and
characteristics
people
in
washington
have
asked
me
if
korea
was
an
island
in
the
mediterranean
others
have
asked
if
korea
could
be
reached
by
rail
from
europe
others
have
supposed
that
korea
was
somewhere
in
the
south
seas
with
a
climate
that
enabled
the
natives
to
dispense
with
clothing
i
have
therefore
included
two
chapters
introductory
and
descriptive
in
character
concerning
the
subjects
of
the
majority
of
such
questions
globe

miles
distant

stroll
through
the

miserable
temporary
huts
occupied
by
the

and

transient
scum

write

korea
corea
or
chosen
morning
calm
occupies
the
peninsula
hanging
down
from
manchooria
and
russian
siberia
between
china
and
japan
and
extending
from
the
to
the
parallels
of
north
latitude
the
area
including
the
outlying
islands
is
about
one
hundred
thousand
square
miles
the
population
according
to
the
most
reliable
estimate
is
a
little
more
than
sixteen
millions
yet
as
the
people
live
in
cities
towns
and
hamlets
the
country
does
not
seem
to
be
thickly
settled
the
climate
varies
much
at
the
extremities
of
the
peninsula
owing
to
the
fact
that
the
southern
portion
is
somewhat
affected
by
the
warm
southern
currents
that
give
japan
its
tropical
climate
but
which
are
warded
off
from
korea
proper
by
the
japanese
islands
the
climate
of
the
central
and
northern
provinces
is
much
the
same
as
that
of
the
northern
central
united
states
with
fewer
changes
the
large
river
at
the
capital
is
not
uncommonly
frozen
over
for
weeks
at
a
time
during
the
winter
so
that
heavy
carts
pass
over
on
the
ice
ice
is
always
preserved
for
general
use
in
summer
the
country
is
decidedly
mountainous
and
well
watered
heavy
timber
abounds
in
the
northeast
the
valleys
are
very
fertile
and
are
well
tilled
as
the
people
are
mainly
devoted
to
agriculture
the
mineral
resources
have
only
been
developed
in
a
crude
way
yet
sufficiently
to
demonstrate
the
great
wealth
of
the
ore
deposits
especially
is
this
true
in
reference
to
the
gold
mines
the
most
pessimistic
visitors
to
korea
are
unstinted
in
their
praise
of
the
beautiful
scenery
which
is
fully
appreciated
by
the
natives
as
well
from
ancient
times
they
have
had
setting
forth
the
natural
charms
of
particular
localities
and
excursions
to
distant
places
for
the
sole
purpose
of
enjoying
the
views
are
a
common
occurrence
the
king
rules
as
absolute
monarch
he
is
assisted
by
the
and
his
two
associates
the
ministers
of
the
left
and
right
next
to
these
come
the
heads
of
the
six
departments
of
etiquette
and
ceremonies
finance
war
public
works
justice
and
registration
with
the
heads
of
the
two
new
departments
that
have
been
added
as
the
result
of
the
opening
up
of
foreign
intercourse
the
foreign
or
outside
office
and
the
home
or
interior
office
this
body
of
officials
forms
the
grand
council
of
the
king
each
of
the
eight
provinces
is
ruled
by
a
governor
who
has
under
him
prefects
local
magistrates
supervisors
of
hamlets
and
petty
officials
so
that
the
whole
scale
makes
a
very
complete
system
and
affords
no
lack
of
officials
there
are
several
special
officers
appointed
by
the
king
one
of
whom
is
the
government
inspector
whose
duty
it
is
to
go
about
in
disguise
learn
the
condition
of
the
people
and
ascertain
if
any
magistrate
abuses
his
office
and
oppresses
the
people
unjustly
any
such
he
may
bring
to
speedy
justice
the
present
dynasty
has
existed
years
being
founded
by
a
revolting
general
named
ye
it
is
known
as
the
ye
dynasty
the
king
name
however
is
never
used
he
is
almost
sacred
to
his
people
those
officials
of
sufficiently
high
rank
to
go
in
before
him
bow
to
the
ground
in
his
presence
and
only
speak
when
spoken
to
then
they
use
a
highly
honorific
language
only
understood
at
court
the
revenues
are
paid
in
kind
hence
the
annual
income
of
an
official
may
consist
of
a
certain
quantity
of
rice
and
other
products
in
addition
to
his
money
compensation
the
king
also
has
the
whole
revenue
resulting
from
the
sale
of
the
ginseng
for
which
the
country
is
noted
this
forms
his
private
purse
the
currency
is
the
common
copper
cash
worth
some
twelve
hundred
to
the
mexican
dollar
though
now
that
the
new
mint
is
in
operation
copper
silver
and
gold
coins
are
being
made
the
old
perforated
cash
will
however
be
hard
to
supplant
owing
to
its
convenience
in
small
transactions
banks
proper
do
not
exist
though
the
government
does
a
kind
of
banking
business
in
granting
orders
on
various
provincial
offices
so
that
a
travelling
official
need
not
be
burdened
with
much
ready
money
a
number
of
large
brokers
at
the
capital
assist
in
the
government
financial
transactions
all
unoccupied
land
belongs
to
the
king
but
any
man
may
take
up
a
homestead
and
after
tilling
it
and
paying
taxes
on
it
for
a
period
of
three
years
it
becomes
his
own
and
must
be
purchased
should
the
government
need
it
deeds
are
given
in
the
form
of
receipts
and
by
the
seller
these
may
be
registered
with
the
local
magistrate
wills
as
understood
in
western
countries
are
not
executed
though
a
father
wishing
to
provide
especially
for
the
children
of
his
concubines
may
make
a
will
or
statement
the
proper
execution
of
which
devolves
upon
the
eldest
son
records
of
the
births
of
males
are
kept
as
are
also
records
of
deaths
but
these
are
not
always
reliable
all
males
of
fifteen
years
of
age
are
registered
at
the
hang
sung
poo
or
department
of
registration
which
issues
to
them
tablets
bearing
their
name
and
address
children
are
also
generally
provided
with
these
tablets
to
prevent
their
getting
lost
the
people
are
well
built
and
strong
as
a
rule
they
are
a
loyal
contented
race
not
grasping
and
rather
too
easy
in
disposition
they
are
intelligent
and
learn
with
great
ease
possessed
of
many
characteristics
in
common
with
their
neighbors
the
chinese
and
japanese
they
yet
seem
to
have
a
personality
indicative
of
a
different
parentage
which
continually
calls
forth
inquiry
as
to
their
origin
in
some
slight
degree
they
resemble
the
aborigines
of
america
and
it
is
believed
that
their
ancestors
came
from
the
north
the
question
opens
up
a
fertile
field
for
study
their
written
records
are
said
to
date
back
three
thousand
years
their
traditional
first
king
descended
from
heaven
five
thousand
years
ago
with
a
civilization
of
such
age
they
might
well
be
excused
for
so
long
barring
their
doors
against
the
new
civilization
of
the
young
nations
of
the
west
while
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
difference
existing
between
the
two
is
more
one
of
degree
than
essence
perhaps
more
vices
may
be
found
in
the
civilization
of
the
west
than
are
known
to
this
people
and
with
a
few
exceptions
the
virtues
taught
by
the
modern
civilization
have
been
practised
for
centuries
behind
the
bars
of
isolation
that
shut
in
this
people
the
people
dress
in
imported
cotton
sheetings
mostly
padding
them
well
with
for
winter
use
and
using
the
plain
bleached
white
or
dying
the
cloth
a
light
shade
of
blue
or
green
rice
is
the
staple
article
of
food
in
the
central
and
southern
provinces
wheat
enters
more
largely
into
the
diet
of
the
northern
people
their
cattle
are
as
large
and
fine
as
may
be
found
anywhere
the
people
eat
much
beef
and
hides
are
a
prominent
article
of
export
their
houses
are
well
built
and
comfortable
foreigners
adapt
them
to
their
own
use
with
little
trouble
the
houses
are
heated
by
means
of
a
system
of
flues
underneath
the
floor
which
is
made
of
large
flagstone
placed
over
the
flues
and
well
cemented
over
all
thick
strong
oil
paper
is
placed
making
a
rich
dark
highly
polished
floor
through
which
no
smoke
can
come
though
it
is
always
agreeably
warm
the
houses
are
all
one
story
built
around
a
court
and
several
sets
of
buildings
each
within
a
separate
wall
usually
make
up
a
gentleman
compound
the
buildings
are
covered
with
a
thick
layer
of
earth
and
capped
with
tile
laid
on
in
graceful
curves
this
roof
insures
coolness
in
summer
the
rooms
are
made
almost
by
the
plentiful
use
of
paper
on
the
walls
outside
and
in
as
well
as
for
doors
and
windows
there
are
three
great
classes
in
korea
the
nobility
the
middle
class
and
the
commoners
a
commoner
not
of
the
proscribed
orders
may
rise
to
nobility
by
successfully
passing
the
competitive
examinations
the
officials
are
appointed
from
the
noble
classes
the
language
is
peculiar
to
the
country
and
while
written
official
documents
are
done
in
the
common
character
of
china
and
japan
the
spoken
language
of
neither
of
these
people
is
understood
in
korea
the
native
language
of
korea
possesses
an
alphabet
and
grammar
and
is
polysyllabic
thus
resembling
english
more
than
it
does
chinese
in
religious
matters
the
koreans
are
peculiar
in
that
they
may
be
said
to
be
without
a
religion
properly
speaking
prior
to
the
advent
of
the
present
dynasty
buddhism
reigned
but
for
years
it
has
been
in
such
disfavor
that
no
priest
dare
enter
a
walled
city
they
still
maintain
temples
in
the
mountains
but
exert
but
little
if
any
influence
in
morals
the
people
are
confucianists
and
their
reverent
devotion
to
their
ancestors
may
serve
in
part
as
a
religion
in
times
of
distress
they
pray
to
heaven
and
seem
really
to
be
very
devoutly
inclined
christianity
came
into
disfavor
through
the
indiscretion
of
its
early
teachers
the
distrust
is
slowly
passing
away
now
and
missionaries
are
openly
employed
in
doing
the
educational
work
that
must
precede
any
successful
attempt
to
secure
the
adoption
of
beliefs
so
radically
different
from
all
existing
ideas
some
of
the
results
of
the
outside
intercourse
that
has
been
indulged
in
for
the
past
eight
years
may
be
mentioned
a
maritime
customs
service
under
the
charge
of
american
and
european
officers
is
in
very
successful
operation
so
is
a
hospital
supported
by
the
government
and
operated
by
american
physicians
gratuitously
furnished
by
the
american
presbyterian
mission
the
government
supports
a
school
for
which
american
teachers
are
employed
american
military
officers
have
charge
of
the
reorganization
of
the
army
and
conduct
a
school
for
the
purpose
of
instructing
the
young
officers
a
mint
silk
filatures
an
electric
light
and
a
telegraph
and
cable
line
are
some
of
the
new
institutions
recently
adopted
and
as
a
rule
now
in
successful
operation
steamships
have
also
been
purchased
more
for
the
purpose
of
transporting
tribute
rice
than
as
a
nucleus
for
a
navy
in
regard
to
the
relations
existing
between
korea
and
china
the
reader
is
respectfully
referred
to
a
paper
delivered
before
the
american
oriental
society
by
the
chinese
scholar
rockhill
secretary
of
legation
at
pekin
and
contained
in
vol
iii
of
the
society
publications
for
in
his
preface
rockhill
says
the
nature
of
korea
relations
with
china
has
for
the
last
thirty
years
been
a
puzzle
for
western
nations
were
they
with
the
ambiguous
utterance
of
the
chinese
government
before
them
that
though
a
vassal
and
tributary
state
of
china
was
entirely
independent
so
far
as
her
government
religion
and
intercourse
with
foreign
states
were
concerned
to
consider
it
as
an
integral
part
of
the
chinese
empire
or
should
they
treat
it
as
a
sovereign
state
enjoying
absolute
international
rights
the
problem
was
practically
solved
by
the
conclusion
of
the
treaty
between
japan
and
later
on
the
united
states
and
korea
but
this
has
not
materially
altered
the
nature
of
the
relations
existing
for
the
last
four
centuries
at
least
between
china
and
its
vassal
that
china
has
however
derived
profit
from
the
opening
of
korea
to
the
commerce
of
nations
there
can
be
no
doubt
for
she
too
being
at
liberty
to
conclude
treaties
with
korea
and
open
this
new
market
to
her
merchants
has
done
so
like
other
nations
though
she
has
chosen
to
call
her
treaty
by
the
euphonious
name
of
and
trade
regulations
for
the
subjects
of
china
and
korea
and
her
diplomatic
representative
in
seoul
resident
for
political
and
commercial
affairs
what
china
relations
with
korea
were
prior
to
the
opening
of
the
latter
kingdom
by
the
treaty
of
i
propose
to
show
in
the
following
pages
taking
as
my
authorities
official
chinese
publications
and
writings
of
men
in
official
position
korean
tales
descriptive
seoul
the
capital
as
paris
is
france
so
seoul
may
be
said
to
be
korea
for
it
is
the
centre
from
which
nearly
every
thing
for
the
country
either
originates
or
is
disseminated
officers
ruling
over
country
districts
usually
have
their
house
in
town
and
expect
to
spend
a
portion
at
least
of
their
time
within
the
walls
of
the
capital
while
some
of
the
provincial
capitals
are
said
to
contain
more
people
and
to
be
more
celebrated
for
certain
reasons
seoul
is
the
home
of
the
king
and
the
mecca
of
his
faithful
subjects
a
description
of
this
city
may
therefore
answer
for
all
the
capital
is
a
city
of
some
inhabitants
half
of
whom
perhaps
live
in
the
extensive
suburbs
without
the
walls
it
lies
in
a
basin
of
granite
sand
surrounded
by
high
mountains
and
their
projecting
ridges
over
which
climbs
the
high
thick
encircling
wall
of
masonry
pierced
at
convenient
points
by
massive
gates
amply
strong
enough
for
defense
against
the
weapons
of
war
in
use
at
the
time
of
building
this
great
relic
of
seclusion
the
city
is
traversed
by
broad
avenues
from
which
runs
a
perfect
labyrinth
of
narrow
streets
originally
none
of
these
streets
were
less
than
twenty
feet
wide
and
some
of
the
avenues
leading
up
to
the
imposing
gates
of
the
palaces
are
even
now
a
good
two
hundred
feet
in
width
but
the
streets
have
all
been
encroached
upon
by
the
little
temporary
thatched
booths
of
the
petty
retail
dealers
so
that
with
the
exception
of
the
approaches
to
the
palaces
the
line
is
broken
the
streets
made
tortuous
and
only
here
and
there
a
broad
open
spot
indicates
the
original
width
of
the
thoroughfare
originally
every
street
was
furnished
with
its
sewer
open
in
the
smaller
streets
while
the
avenues
were
drained
by
great
covered
sewers
of
stonework
occasionally
the
proprietor
of
one
of
the
little
temporary
booths
would
put
a
foundation
under
his
structure
bridging
over
the
sewer
until
now
the
streets
have
in
many
cases
become
mere
crooked
alleys
and
but
for
the
bountiful
rains
the
excellent
natural
drainage
and
the
character
of
the
soil
the
mortality
would
be
very
great
instead
of
being
less
than
in
ordinary
american
cities
no
attempt
is
made
towards
street
decoration
as
that
would
attract
the
attention
of
thieves
the
magnificent
grounds
of
a
nobleman
with
their
artificial
lakes
flower
gardens
pillars
of
ancient
rock
and
quaintly
twisted
trees
may
be
enclosed
by
a
row
of
that
would
never
indicate
the
beauty
to
be
found
hidden
within
its
forbidding
exterior
travellers
never
seem
to
realize
that
a
street
in
the
east
is
apt
to
be
but
a
way
between
two
points
and
as
the
usual
oriental
odors
greet
their
nostrils
and
their
eyes
rest
on
the
dirty
servants
and
their
dirtier
hovels
they
at
once
denounce
the
whole
town
there
is
attraction
enough
however
in
a
korean
street
for
any
one
who
is
in
search
of
strange
sights
looking
down
one
of
the
broad
thoroughfares
of
seoul
from
a
point
on
the
city
wall
the
sun
rays
falling
on
the
gowns
of
the
pedestrians
as
they
saunter
along
amid
the
bulls
and
ponies
produce
a
kaleidoscopic
effect
that
is
certainly
charming
passing
down
into
the
throng
it
will
be
seen
to
be
made
up
mostly
of
men
with
here
and
there
a
group
of
common
women
each
closely
veiled
with
a
bright
green
gown
made
like
the
long
outer
garment
of
the
men
and
possessing
little
sleeves
of
crimson
this
strange
garment
is
never
worn
but
is
always
used
as
a
covering
for
the
fair
face
tradition
teaches
that
in
ancient
times
when
wars
were
frequent
veils
were
discarded
and
these
gowns
were
worn
by
the
wives
and
sisters
that
in
case
of
sudden
call
to
arms
they
could
be
given
to
their
husbands
and
brothers
to
be
worn
to
battle
hence
the
red
sleeves
upon
which
the
gory
sword
was
to
be
wiped
the
peculiar
gauze
hat
of
the
men
about
which
so
much
has
been
said
also
has
its
origin
in
tradition
as
follows
in
ancient
days
conspiracies
were
common
to
prevent
these
an
edict
was
issued
compelling
all
men
to
wear
great
earthenware
hats
the
size
of
an
umbrella
type
of
the
mourner
hat
in
korea
except
that
the
latter
is
made
of
finely
woven
this
law
became
very
odious
for
in
addition
to
the
weight
of
the
hats
not
more
than
a
very
few
men
could
come
close
enough
together
to
converse
and
even
then
spies
could
hear
their
necessarily
loud
whispering
little
by
little
therefore
the
law
began
to
be
infringed
upon
till
the
people
got
down
to
the
present
airy
structure
of
horsehair
silk
and
bamboo
another
story
is
that
petty
wars
being
too
frequent
between
rival
sections
all
men
were
compelled
to
wear
these
umbrella
hats
of
clay
in
case
one
became
broken
the
possessor
was
punished
by
decapitation
naturally
they
stopped
their
fighting
and
took
good
care
of
their
hats
till
the
law
was
repealed
the
custom
of
wearing
white
so
extensively
as
they
do
is
also
accounted
for
by
tradition
mourning
is
a
serious
business
in
korea
for
on
the
death
of
a
father
the
son
must
lay
aside
his
gay
robes
and
clothe
himself
in
unbleached
cotton
of
a
very
coarse
texture
he
wraps
his
waist
with
a
rope
girdle
and
puts
on
the
umbrella
hat
which
conceals
the
whole
upper
portion
of
his
person
for
further
protection
against
intrusion
he
carries
a
white
fan
and
should
he
smoke
his
pipe
must
be
wrapped
with
white
for
three
years
he
must
wear
this
guise
and
must
do
no
work
so
that
the
resources
of
even
a
large
and
prosperous
family
may
be
thus
exhausted
should
a
king
die
the
whole
nation
would
be
compelled
to
don
this
mourning
garb
or
rather
they
would
be
compelled
to
dress
in
white
the
mourning
color
once
during
a
period
of
ten
years
three
kings
died
necessitating
a
constant
change
of
dress
on
the
part
of
the
people
and
a
great
outlay
of
money
for
a
korean
wardrobe
is
extensive
and
costly
tradition
has
it
therefore
that
to
be
ready
for
the
caprice
of
their
kings
in
the
future
the
people
adopted
white
as
the
national
color
the
nobility
and
wealthy
persons
who
can
afford
it
dress
in
rich
gayly
colored
silks
and
even
the
common
people
add
a
little
blue
or
green
to
their
outside
robes
so
that
when
they
wander
about
over
the
beautiful
green
hills
in
their
favorite
pastime
of
admiring
the
natural
beauties
of
a
remarkably
beautiful
and
well
preserved
landscape
their
bright
gowns
but
add
to
the
general
effect
and
a
long
procession
of
monks
emerging
from
their
high
mountain
temple
and
descending
along
the
green
mountain
path
might
be
taken
for
a
company
of
the
spirits
with
which
their
literature
abounds
especially
will
this
be
the
case
if
as
is
common
the
region
of
the
temple
is
shrouded
with
clouds
but
little
of
home
life
is
seen
along
the
streets
and
the
favored
ones
who
may
pass
the
great
gates
and
traverse
the
many
courts
which
lead
to
the
fine
inclosures
of
the
nobility
would
see
but
little
of
home
life
as
the
women
have
quarters
by
themselves
and
are
only
seen
by
the
men
of
their
own
family
it
is
pleasant
however
to
see
the
little
groups
of
the
working
class
sitting
around
the
fire
which
is
cooking
their
evening
meal
and
at
the
same
time
heating
the
platform
of
paper
and
stones
which
form
the
floor
of
their
bed
chamber
and
on
which
they
will
spread
their
mats
and
sleep
they
will
all
be
found
to
be
smoking
and
if
tobacco
was
ever
a
blessing
to
any
people
it
is
to
the
lower
classes
in
korea
who
find
in
it
their
greatest
comfort
no
one
could
see
the
solid
enjoyment
taken
by
a
korean
coolie
with
his
pipe
without
blessing
the
weed
as
the
fires
burn
low
and
one
by
one
the
smokers
have
knocked
the
ashes
from
their
pipes
and
sought
the
warm
stone
floor
a
deep
stillness
settles
over
the
profoundly
dark
city
the
rich
deep
notes
of
a
great
centrally
located
bell
ring
out
as
the
watchman
draws
back
a
huge
suspended
beam
of
wood
and
releasing
it
lets
it
strike
the
bronze
side
of
the
heavy
bell
from
which
vibration
after
vibration
is
sent
forth
upon
the
still
some
weird
music
which
has
been
likened
to
that
of
scotch
bagpipes
is
heard
from
the
direction
of
the
city
gates
and
the
traveller
who
is
still
threading
the
streets
to
his
abode
feels
thankful
that
he
has
arrived
in
time
for
now
the
massive
gates
are
closed
and
none
may
enter
without
royal
permission
the
street
traveller
will
also
hasten
to
his
home
or
for
between
the
ringing
of
the
evening
chimes
and
the
tolling
of
the
bell
to
announce
the
approach
of
dawn
all
men
must
absent
themselves
from
the
streets
which
then
are
taken
possession
of
by
the
women
who
even
then
as
they
flit
about
from
house
to
house
with
their
little
paper
lanterns
go
veiled
lest
some
passing
official
should
see
their
faces
the
midnight
stillness
is
broken
by
the
barking
of
countless
dogs
but
as
cats
are
in
disfavor
their
serenades
are
seldom
heard
another
sound
is
often
in
busy
times
heard
throughout
the
whole
night
it
is
peculiar
to
korea
and
to
one
who
has
lived
long
in
the
country
it
means
much
it
is
the
drumming
of
the
korean
laundry
to
give
the
gowns
their
highly
prized
lustre
they
must
be
well
pounded
for
this
purpose
the
cloth
is
wrapped
around
a
long
hard
roller
which
is
fixed
in
a
low
frame
two
women
then
sit
facing
each
other
with
in
each
hand
a
round
hard
stick
something
like
a
small
bat
and
they
commence
beating
the
cloth
alternating
so
as
to
make
quite
a
musical
tinkle
heard
at
some
distance
this
rhythmic
rattle
is
not
unpleasant
and
one
is
assured
that
in
the
deep
night
that
has
settled
so
like
a
pall
over
the
city
two
persons
are
and
industriously
engaged
while
when
the
tapping
ceases
for
a
bit
one
is
comforted
with
the
thought
that
the
poor
things
are
enjoying
a
rich
bit
of
gossip
or
welcoming
a
friend
who
is
more
fortunate
in
having
finished
her
ironing
in
time
to
enjoy
the
freedom
of
the
night
inside
the
palace
the
night
is
turned
into
day
as
nearly
as
can
be
done
by
the
electric
light
the
business
of
the
government
is
mostly
transacted
at
night
that
the
wheels
of
administration
may
run
smoothly
during
the
day
at
several
lights
may
be
seen
on
the
summit
of
the
beautiful
ever
green
south
mountain
which
forms
the
southern
limit
of
the
city
as
does
a
grim
stony
peak
on
the
north
serve
a
similar
purpose
on
that
side
the
south
mountain
faces
the
palaces
it
also
commands
a
good
view
of
the
outlying
peaks
upon
some
of
which
situated
in
suitable
localities
are
stationed
watchmen
so
placed
as
to
command
a
view
of
others
farther
and
farther
removed
thus
forming
lines
from
the
distant
borders
of
the
country
to
the
capital
on
these
peaks
small
are
nightly
kindled
and
as
the
lights
are
seen
by
the
watchman
on
the
south
mountain
he
builds
the
proper
number
of
fires
upon
little
altars
in
full
view
of
the
palace
then
a
body
of
gray
old
officers
go
in
before
his
majesty
and
bowing
their
heads
to
the
floor
make
known
the
verdict
of
the
as
to
whether
peace
reigns
in
the
borders
or
not
soon
after
this
the
officials
assemble
and
the
business
of
the
government
begins
the
king
giving
his
personal
attention
to
all
matters
of
importance
there
are
three
palace
inclosures
in
the
city
only
one
of
which
is
occupied
one
is
an
old
ruined
place
that
was
built
for
the
use
of
a
ruler
who
chanced
to
be
regent
for
his
father
and
as
he
could
not
reside
in
the
palace
proper
this
smaller
place
was
prepared
for
him
the
buildings
now
are
in
ruins
while
the
large
grounds
are
used
by
the
foreign
silk
expert
as
a
nursery
for
the
present
palace
includes
some
hundreds
of
acres
and
is
the
home
of
more
than
three
thousand
attendants
the
grounds
are
beautifully
diversified
by
little
lakes
of
several
acres
in
extent
one
of
which
surrounds
a
magnificent
and
stately
pavilion
supported
on
great
stone
pillars
a
fine
picture
and
description
of
this
and
other
parts
of
the
palace
may
be
found
in
lowell
chosen
the
other
lake
possesses
a
bright
little
pavilion
around
which
plays
a
steam
launch
dividing
the
lotus
flowers
which
grow
in
the
water
and
startling
the
swan
duck
and
other
aquatic
animals
that
make
this
their
home
these
lakes
are
fed
and
drained
by
a
mountain
stream
that
enters
and
leaves
the
palace
inclosure
through
built
under
the
walls
some
of
the
bridges
spanning
this
brook
are
quaint
pieces
of
artistic
masonry
having
animals
carved
in
blocks
of
stone
represented
in
the
act
of
plunging
into
the
liquid
depths
below
this
carved
stone
work
abounds
throughout
the
palace
buildings
the
largest
of
which
is
the
great
with
its
pillars
supporting
a
ceiling
at
an
elevation
of
near
one
hundred
feet
above
the
tiled
floor
the
of
the
royal
family
are
built
upon
the
banks
of
one
of
the
small
lakes
and
are
surrounded
by
walls
for
greater
seclusion
the
rooms
are
furnished
with
costly
articles
from
european
markets
together
with
the
finest
native
furniture
cooks
are
employed
and
the
dinners
sometimes
given
to
distinguished
foreign
guests
are
in
entire
accord
with
modern
western
methods
royalty
is
never
present
at
these
banquets
which
are
presided
over
by
one
of
the
heads
of
departments
the
royal
family
maybe
witnessing
the
novel
sight
from
a
secluded
place
where
their
presence
may
not
be
known
the
king
only
leaves
the
palace
upon
certain
occasions
as
when
he
goes
to
bow
before
the
tombs
of
his
ancestors
on
these
occasions
the
streets
are
cleared
of
the
little
booths
of
the
petty
retail
merchants
as
well
as
of
all
other
unsightly
objects
the
street
is
roped
off
and
sprinkled
with
fresh
earth
and
the
people
don
their
holiday
garb
for
it
is
indeed
a
great
gala
day
to
them
the
procession
is
a
gorgeous
relic
of
mediæval
times
with
bits
of
the
present
strangely
incorporated
there
may
be
regiments
of
soldiers
in
the
ancient
fiery
coats
of
mail
preceded
or
followed
by
soldiers
dressed
in
the
queer
hybrid
uniforms
of
the
modern
army
and
bearing
the
bayoneted
rifles
of
the
present
day
instead
of
the
quaint
and
ugly
spears
of
the
ancient
guard
the
wild
weird
music
of
the
native
bands
may
be
followed
by
the
tooting
of
the
buglers
of
the
modern
soldiery
the
strange
chair
of
an
official
with
its
numbers
of
pushers
and
supporters
will
probably
be
followed
by
an
artillery
company
dragging
gatling
guns
his
majesty
himself
will
be
borne
in
a
great
chair
of
red
work
supported
on
the
shoulders
of
oddly
attired
bearers
while
high
officials
in
the
government
service
may
be
mounted
on
horse
back
or
borne
in
less
pretentious
chairs
the
length
of
the
procession
varies
but
it
is
seldom
less
than
an
hour
in
passing
a
given
place
the
king
is
years
of
age
the
queen
is
one
year
his
senior
the
crown
prince
is
fifteen
years
old
and
has
no
brothers
or
sisters
foreigners
who
have
been
granted
an
audience
with
the
king
are
always
pleased
with
his
affability
and
brightness
he
is
quick
of
perception
and
very
progressive
by
having
foreign
newspapers
translated
to
him
he
keeps
fully
abreast
of
the
times
he
is
to
a
fault
and
much
concerned
for
the
welfare
of
his
people
his
word
is
law
and
an
official
would
never
think
of
failing
to
carry
out
his
instructions
or
perish
in
the
attempt
owing
to
his
great
seclusion
and
the
amount
of
ceremony
with
which
he
is
hedged
in
and
the
fact
that
as
a
rule
nothing
disagreeable
must
be
brought
to
his
notice
he
is
somewhat
at
the
mercy
of
his
favorites
and
a
trusted
eunuch
having
the
king
ear
continually
may
become
a
great
power
for
good
or
bad
as
the
case
may
be
as
decapitation
is
the
usual
punishment
for
most
crimes
however
and
as
an
official
who
should
deceive
the
king
would
probably
meet
with
such
an
end
the
responsibility
of
the
place
is
apt
to
sober
an
otherwise
fickle
mind
and
insure
honest
reports
the
rabbit
and
other
legends
stories
of
birds
and
animals
the
koreans
are
great
students
of
nature
nothing
seems
to
escape
their
attention
as
they
plod
through
the
fields
or
saunter
for
pleasure
over
the
green
hills
a
naturally
picturesque
landscape
is
preserved
in
its
freshness
by
the
law
that
forbids
the
cutting
of
timber
or
fuel
in
any

the
necessity
that
compels
the
peasants
to
carefully
rake
together
all
the

underbrush

causes
even
the

present

appearance

nature
beauty
in
korea
may
be
said
to
be
enhanced
rather
than
marred
by
the
presence
of
man
since
the
bright
tints
of
the
ample
costume
worn
by
all
lends
a
quaint
charm
to
the
view
the
white
garments
of
the
peasants
at
work
in
the
fields
are
not
especially
attractive
at
short
range
but
the
clad
in
a
gorgeous
gown
of
muslin
adds
a
pleasant
touch
to
the
general
effect
as
he
winds
about
the
hills
following
one
of
the
paths
while
the
flowing
robes
of
brightly
colored
silk
worn
by
the
frequent
parties
of
gentry
who
may
be
met
strolling
for
recreation
are
a
positive
attraction
nor
are
these
groups
uncommon
the
climate
during
most
of
the
year
is
so
delightful
the
gentry
are
so
a
people
of
leisure
and
are
so
fond
of
games
and
music
that
they
may
be
continually
met
taking
a
stroll
through
the
country
as
has
been
said
nothing
seems
to
have
escaped
their
attention
the
flowers
that
carpet
the
earth
from
snow
till
snow
have
each
been
named
and
their
seasons
are
known
the
throws
out
its
pretty
sessile
blossoms
upon
the
leafless
stem
sometimes
before
the
snows
have
left
as
though
summer
were
borne
upon
winter
bare
arm
with
no
leafy
spring
to
herald
her
approach
then
the
autumn
snows
and
frosts
often
arrive
before
the
great
chrysanthemums
have
ceased
their
blooming
while
between
the
seasons
of
the
two
heralds
bloom
myriads
of
pretty
plants
that
should
make
up
a
veritable
botanical
paradise
summer
finds
the
whole
covered
with
the
delicate
fluffy
bloom
of
the
pink
azaleas
summoning
forth
the
bands
of
beauty
seekers
who
have
already
admired
the
peach
and
the
plum
orchards
great
beds
of
nodding
lilies
of
the
valley
usher
in
the
harvest
and
even
the
forest
trees
occasionally
add
their
weight
of
blossoms
to
the
general
effect
the
coming
and
going
of
the
birds
is
looked
for
and
the
peculiarities
and
music
of
each
are
known
as
a
rule
they
are
named
in
accordance
with
the
notes
they
utter
the
pigeon
is
the
the
crow
the
the
swallow
the
and
so
on
one
bird
i
think
it
is
the
oriole
is
associated
with
a
pretty
legend
to
the
effect
that
once
upon
a
time
one
of
the
numerous
ladies
at
court
had
a
love
affair
with
one
of
the
palace
officials
a
kim
it
was
discovered
and
the
poor
thing
lost
her
life
her
spirit
could
not
be
killed
however
and
unappeased
it
entered
this
bird
in
which
form
she
returned
to
the
palace
and
sang
then
receiving
no
response
she
would
mournfully
entreat
now
in
the
language
of
korea
means
call
kim
or
tell
kim
to
come
and
kim
poh
go
sip
so
means
i
want
to
see
kim
so
even
to
this
day
the
women
and
children
feel
sad
when
they
hear
these
plaintive
notes
and
unconsciously
their
hearts
go
out
in
pity
for
the
poor
lone
lover
who
is
ever
searching
in
vain
for
her
kim
another
bird
of
sadness
is
the
cuckoo
and
the
women
dislike
to
hear
its
homesick
notes
echoing
across
the
valleys
the
pe
chu
kuh
ruk
is
a
bird
that
sings
in
the
wild
mountain
places
and
warns
people
that
robbers
are
near
when
it
comes
to
the
hamlets
and
sings
the
people
know
that
the
rice
crop
will
be
a
failure
and
that
they
will
have
to
eat
millet
the
crow
is
in
great
disfavor
as
it
eats
dead
dog
and
brings
the
dread
fever
yim
pyung
the
magpie
that
impudent
noisy
nuisance
however
is
in
great
favor
so
much
so
that
his
great
ugly
nest
is
safe
from
human
disturbance
and
his
presence
is
quite
acceptable
especially
in
the
morning
he
seems
to
be
the
champion
of
the
swallows
that
colonize
the
thick
roofs
and
build
their
little
mud
houses
underneath
the
tiles
for
when
one
of
the
great
lazy
comes
out
to
sun
himself
after
a
meal
of
young
swallows
the
bereaved
parents
and
friends
at
once
fly
off
for
the
saucy
magpie
who
comes
promptly
and
dashes
at
the
head
amid
the
encouraging
jabbering
of
the
swallows
they
usually
succeed
in
driving
the
reptile
under
the
tiles
should
the
magpie
come
to
the
house
with
his
excuse
for
a
song
in
the
morning
good
news
may
be
expected
during
the
day
father
will
return
from
a
long
journey
brother
will
succeed
in
his
examination
and
obtain
rank
or
good
news
will
be
brought
by
post
should
the
magpie
come
in
the
afternoon
with
his
jargon
a
guest
not
a
friend
may
be
expected
with
an
appetite
equal
to
that
of
a
family
of
children
while
if
the
magpie
comes
after
dark
thieves
may
be
dreaded
this
office
of
is
also
bestowed
upon
the
domestic
goose
aside
from
its
beauty
this
bird
is
greatly
esteemed
for
its
daring
in
promptly
sounding
an
alarm
should
any
untimely
visitor
enter
the
court
as
well
as
for
its
bravery
in
boldly
pecking
at
and
in
some
cases
driving
out
the
intruder
the
wild
goose
is
one
of
the
most
highly
prized
birds
in
korea
it
always
participates
in
the
wedding
ceremonies
for
no
man
would
think
himself
properly
married
had
he
not
been
presented
by
his
bride
with
a
wild
goose
even
though
the
bird
were
simply
hired
for
the
occasion
the
reason
for
this
is
that
these
observing
people
once
noticed
that
a
goose
whose
mate
was
killed
returned
to
the
place
year
after
year
to
mourn
her
loss
and
such
constancy
they
seek
by
this
pretty
custom
to
commend
to
their
wives
they
further
pledge
each
other
at
this
time
in
these
words
black
is
the
hair
that
now
crowns
our
heads
yet
when
it
has
become
as
white
as
the
fibres
of
the
onion
root
we
shall
still
be
found
faithful
to
each
other
the
white
heron
seems
to
be
the
especial
friend
of
man
many
are
the
tales
told
of
the
assistance
it
has
rendered
individuals
in
one
case
the
creature
is
said
to
have
pecked
off
its
bill
in
its
frantic
attempts
to
ring
a
temple
bell
for
the
salvation
of
a
man
one
of
the
early
stories
relates
how
a
hunter
having
shot
an
arrow
through
the
head
of
a
snake
that
was
about
to
devour
some
newly
hatched
herons
was
in
turn
saved
by
the
mother
bird
who
pecked
to
death
a
snake
that
had
gotten
into
the
man
stomach
while
he
was
drinking
at
a
spring
the
pecking
further
was
so
expertly
done
as
not
to
injure
the
man
the
swallows
are
everywhere
welcome
while
the
thievish
sparrows
are
killed
as
often
as
possible
the
former
live
in
the
roofs
of
the
houses
and
usually
awaken
the
inmates
by
their
delighted
chattering
at
each
recurrence
of
dawn
a
charming
story
is
told
of
a
rewarding
a
kind
man
who
had
rescued
it
from
a
snake
and
bound
up
its
broken
leg
the
anecdote
is
too
long
to
be
related
in
this
connection
further
than
to
say
that
the
bird
gave
the
man
a
seed
which
being
planted
brought
him
a
vast
fortune
while
a
seed
given
to
his
wicked
brother
who
was
cruel
to
the
swallows
worked
his
ruin
the
bird
held
in
the
highest
favor
however
is
the
stork
it
is
engraved
in
jade
and
gold
and
embroidered
in
silk
as
the
insignia
of
rank
for
the
nobility
it
is
the
bird
that
soars
above
the
battle
and
calls
down
success
upon
the
korean
arms
in
its
majestic
flight
it
is
supposed
to
mount
to
heaven
hence
its
wisdom
for
it
is
reputed
to
be
a
very
wise
bird
a
man
was
once
said
to
have
ridden
to
heaven
on
the
back
of
a
huge
stork
and
judging
from
the
great
strength
of
a
pair
the
writer
once
had
as
pets
the
people
are
warranted
in
believing
that
in
the
marvellous
days
of
the
ancients
these
birds
were
used
for
purposes
of
transportation
the
animals
too
have
their
stories
and
in
korea
as
in
some
other
parts
of
the
world
the
rabbit
seems
to
come
off
best
as
a
rule
one
very
good
story
is
told
concerning
a
scrape
the
rabbit
got
himself
into
because
of
his
curiosity
but
out
of
which
he
extricated
himself
at
the
expense
of
the
whole
fraternity
of
water
animals
it
seems
that
on
one
occasion
the
king
of
fishes
was
a
little
indiscreet
and
while
snapping
greedily
at
a
worm
got
a
hook
through
his
nose
he
succeeded
in
breaking
the
line
and
escaped
having
his
royal
bones
picked
by
some
hungry
mortal
but
he
was
still
in
a
great
dilemma
for
he
could
in
no
way
remove
the
cruel
hook
his
finny
majesty
grew
very
ill
all
the
officials
of
his
kingdom
were
summoned
and
met
in
solemn
council
from
the
turtle
to
the
whale
each
one
wore
an
anxious
expression
and
did
his
best
at
thinking
at
last
the
turtle
was
asked
for
his
opinion
and
announced
his
firm
belief
that
a
poultice
made
from
the
fresh
eye
of
a
rabbit
would
remove
the
disorder
of
their
sovereign
at
once
he
was
listened
to
attentively
but
his
plan
was
conceded
to
be
impracticable
since
they
had
no
fresh
rabbit
eyes
or
any
means
of
obtaining
them
then
the
turtle
again
came
to
the
rescue
and
said
that
he
had
a
passing
acquaintance
with
the
rabbit
whom
he
had
occasionally
seen
when
walking
along
the
beach
and
that
he
would
endeavor
to
bring
him
to
the
palace
if
the
doctors
would
then
take
charge
of
the
work
for
the
sight
of
blood
disagreed
with
him
and
he
would
ask
to
absent
himself
from
the
further
conduct
of
the
case
he
was
royally
thanked
for
his
offer
and
sent
off
in
haste
realizing
full
well
that
his
career
was
made
in
case
he
succeeded
while
he
would
be
very
much
unmade
if
he
failed
was
a
very
hot
day
as
the
fat
turtle
dragged
himself
up
the
where
he
fortunately
espied
the
rabbit
the
latter
having
jumped
away
a
short
distance
cocked
his
ears
and
looked
over
his
back
to
see
who
was
approaching
perceiving
the
turtle
he
went
over
and
accosted
him
with
what
are
you
doing
away
up
here
sir
i
simply
came
up
for
a
view
i
have
always
heard
that
the
view
over
the
water
from
your
hills
was
excellent
but
i
ca
say
it
pays
one
for
the
trouble
of
coming
up
and
the
turtle
wiped
off
his
long
neck
and
stretched
himself
out
to
cool
off
in
the
air
you
are
not
high
enough
just
come
with
me
if
you
want
to
see
a
view
and
the
rabbit
straightened
up
as
if
to
start
no
indeed
i
have
had
enough
for
once
i
prefer
the
water
why
you
should
see
the
magnificent
sights
down
there
there
are
beautiful
green
forests
of
waving
trees
mountains
of
cool
stones
valleys
and
caves
great
open
plains
made
beautiful
by
companies
of
brightly
robed
fishes
royal
processions
from
our
palaces
and
best
of
all
the
water
bears
you
up
and
you
go
everywhere
without
exertion
no
let
me
return
you
have
nothing
on
this
dry
hot
earth
worth
seeing
the
turtle
turned
to
go
but
the
rabbit
musingly
followed
at
length
he
said
do
you
have
any
difficulty
in
the
water
does
it
get
into
your
eyes
and
mouth
for
he
really
longed
in
his
heart
to
see
the
strange
sights
oh
no
it
bothers
us
no
more
than
air
after
we
have
once
become
accustomed
to
it
said
the
turtle
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
the
place
said
the
rabbit
rather
to
himself
but
is
no
use
i
could
live
in
the
water
like
a
fish
why
certainly
not
and
the
turtle
concealed
his
excitement
under
an
air
of
indifference
you
could
get
along
by
yourself
but
if
you
really
wish
to
see
something
that
will
surprise
you
you
may
get
on
my
back
give
me
your
and
i
will
take
you
down
all
right
after
some
further
assurance
the
rabbit
accepted
the
apparently
generous
offer
and
on
arriving
at
the
beach
he
allowed
himself
to
be
firmly
fixed
on
the
turtle
back
and
down
they
went
into
the
water
to
the
great
discomfort
of
the
rabbit
who
however
eventually
became
so
accustomed
to
the
water
that
he
did
not
much
mind
it
he
was
charmed
and
bewildered
by
the
magnificence
of
every
thing
he
saw
and
especially
by
the
gorgeous
palace
through
which
he
was
escorted
by
attendant
fishes
to
the
sick
chamber
of
the
king
where
he
found
a
great
council
of
learned
doctors
who
welcomed
him
very
warmly
while
sitting
in
an
elegant
chair
and
gazing
about
at
the
surrounding
magnificence
he
chanced
to
hear
a
discussion
concerning
the
best
way
of
securing
his
eyes
before
he
should
die
he
was
filled
with
horror
and
questioning
an
attendant
the
whole
plot
was
explained
to
him
the
poor
fellow
scratched
his
head
and
wondered
if
he
would
ever
get
out
of
the
place
alive
at
last
a
happy
thought
struck
him
he
explained
to
them
that
he
always
carried
about
two
pairs
of
eyes
his
real
ones
and
a
pair
made
of
mountain
crystals
to
be
used
in
very
dusty
weather
fearing
that
the
water
would
injure
his
real
eyes
he
had
buried
them
in
the
sand
before
getting
upon
the
turtle
back
and
was
now
using
his
crystal
ones
he
further
expressed
himself
as
most
willing
to
let
them
have
one
of
his
real
eyes
with
which
to
cure
his
disorder
and
assured
them
that
he
believed
one
eye
would
answer
the
purpose
he
gave
them
to
understand
that
he
felt
highly
honored
in
being
allowed
to
assist
in
so
important
a
work
and
declared
that
if
they
would
give
the
necessary
order
he
would
hasten
on
the
back
to
the
spot
where
he
had
buried
the
eyes
and
return
speedily
with
one
marvelling
much
at
the
rabbit
courtesy
the
fishes
slunk
away
into
the
corners
for
very
shame
at
their
own
rude
conduct
in
forcibly
kidnapping
him
when
a
simple
request
would
have
accomplished
their
purpose
the
turtle
was
rather
roughly
commanded
to
carry
the
guest
to
the
place
designated
which
he
did
once
released
by
the
turtle
to
dig
for
the
eyes
in
the
sand
the
rabbit
shook
the
water
from
his
coat
and
winking
at
his
clumsy
betrayer
told
him
to
dig
for
the
eyes
himself
that
he
had
only
one
pair
and
those
he
intended
to
keep
with
that
he
tore
away
up
the
mountain
side
and
has
ever
after
been
careful
to
give
the
turtle
a
wide
berth
the
enchanted
or
why
the
cat
and
dog
are
enemies
in
ancient
times
there
lived
an
old
man
by
the
bank
where
the
land
he
was
poor
but
honest
and
being
childless
and
compelled
to
earn
his
own
food
he
kept
a
little
which
small
though
it
was
possessed
quite
a
local
reputation
for
the
aged
proprietor
would
permit
no
quarrelling
on
his
premises
and
sold
only
one
brand
of
wine
and
this
was
of
really
excellent
quality
he
did
not
keep
a
pot
of
broth
simmering
over
the
coals
at
his
door
to
tempt
the
and
thus
increase
his
thirst
on
leaving
the
old
man
rather
preferred
the
customers
who
brought
their
little
bottles
and
carried
the
drink
to
their
homes
there
were
some
peculiarities
almost
mysteries
about
this
little
the
old
man
had
apparently
always
been
there
and
had
never
seemed
any
younger
his
wine
never
gave
out
no
matter
how
great
might
be
the
local
thirst
yet
he
was
never
seen
to
make
or
take
in
a
new
supply
nor
had
he
a
great
array
of
vessels
in
his
shop
on
the
contrary
he
always
seemed
to
pour
the
wine
out
of
the
one
and
same
old
bottle
the
long
slender
neck
of
which
was
black
and
shiny
from
being
so
often
tipped
in
his
old
hand
while
the
generous
warming
stream
gurgled
outward
to
the
bowl
this
had
long
ceased
to
be
a
matter
of
inquiry
however
and
only
upon
the
advent
of
a
stranger
of
an
inquiring
mind
would
the
subject
be
the
neighbors
were
assured
that
the
old
man
was
thoroughly
good
and
that
his
wine
was
better
furthermore
he
sold
it
as
reasonably
as
other
men
sold
a
much
inferior
article
and
more
than
this
they
did
not
care
to
know
or
at
least
if
they
did
once
care
they
had
gotten
over
it
and
were
now
content
to
let
well
enough
alone
i
said
the
old
man
had
no
children
that
is
true
yet
he
had
that
which
in
a
slight
degree
took
the
place
of
children
in
that
they
were
his
daily
care
his
constant
companions
and
the
partners
of
his
bed
and
board
these
deputy
children
were
none
other
than
a
old
dog
with
laughing
face
and
eyes
long
silken
ears
that
were
ever
on
the
alert
yet
too
soft
to
stand
erect
a
chunky
neck
and
a
large
round
body
covered
with
long
soft
tan
hair
and
ending
in
a
bushy
tail
he
was
the
very
impersonation
of
canine
wisdom
and
and
seldom
became
ruffled
unless
he
saw
his
master
worried
by
the
ill
behavior
of
one
of
his
patrons
or
when
a
festive
flea
persisted
in
attacking
him
on
all
sides
at
once
his
fellow
a
cat
would
sometimes
assist
in
the
onslaught
when
the
dog
was
about
to
be
defeated
and
completely
ruffled
by
his
tormentor
this
thomas
was
also
a
character
in
his
own
way
and
though
past
the
days
when
his
chief
ambition
had
been
to
catch
his
tail
he
had
such
a
strong
vein
of
humor
running
through
him
that
age
could
not
subdue
his
frivolous
propensities
he
had
been
known
to
drop
a
dead
mouse
upon
the
dog
nose
from
the
counter
while
the
latter
was
endeavoring
to
get
a
quiet
nap
and
then
he
would
blow
his
tail
up
as
a
balloon
hump
his
back
and
look
utterly
shocked
at
such
conduct
as
the
startled
dog
nearly
jumped
out
of
his
skin
and
growling
horribly
tore
around
as
though
he
were
either
in
chase
of
a
wild
beast
or
being
chased
by
one
this
happy
couple
lived
in
the
greatest
contentment
with
the
old
man
they
slept
in
the
little
kang
room
with
him
at
night
and
enjoyed
the
warm
stone
floor
with
its
slick
covering
as
much
as
did
their
master
when
the
old
man
would
go
out
on
a
mild
moonlit
night
to
enjoy
a
pipe
of
tobacco
and
gaze
at
the
stars
his
companions
would
rush
out
and
announce
to
the
world
that
they
were
not
asleep
but
ready
to
encounter
any
and
every
thing
that
the
darkness
might
bring
forth
so
long
as
it
did
not
enter
their
master
private
court
of
which
they
were
in
possession
these
two
were
companions
up
to
this
time
they
had
not
been
with
the
old
man
when
a
bowl
of
rice
was
a
luxury
their
days
did
not
antedate
the
period
of
the
successful
history
the
old
man
however
often
recalled
those
former
days
with
a
shudder
and
thought
with
great
complacency
of
the
time
when
he
had
befriended
a
divine
being
in
the
form
of
a
weary
human
traveller
to
whom
he
gave
the
last
drink
his
jug
contained
and
how
when
the
contents
of
the
little
jug
had
gurgled
down
the
stranger
throat
in
a
long
unbroken
draught
the
stranger
had
given
him
a
trifling
little
thing
that
looked
like
a
bit
of
amber
saying
drop
this
into
your
jug
old
man
and
so
long
as
it
remains
there
you
will
never
want
for
a
drink
he
did
so
and
sure
enough
the
jug
was
heavy
with
something
so
that
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
could
he
believe
it
a
most
delicious
stream
of
wine
poured
down
his
parched
throat
he
took
the
jug
down
and
peered
into
its
black
depths
he
shook
its
sides
causing
the
elf
within
to
dance
and
laugh
aloud
and
shutting
his
eyes
again
he
took
another
long
draught
then
meaning
well
he
remembered
the
stranger
and
was
about
to
offer
him
a
drink
when
he
discovered
that
he
was
all
alone
and
began
to
wonder
at
the
strange
circumstance
and
to
think
what
he
was
to
do
i
ca
sit
here
and
drink
all
the
time
or
i
will
be
drunk
and
some
thief
will
carry
away
my
jug
i
ca
live
on
wine
alone
yet
i
dare
not
leave
this
strange
thing
while
i
seek
for
work
like
many
another
to
whom
fortune
has
just
come
he
knew
not
for
a
time
what
to
do
with
his
finally
he
hit
upon
the
scheme
of
keeping
a
the
success
of
which
we
have
seen
and
have
perhaps
refused
the
old
man
credit
for
the
wisdom
he
displayed
in
continuing
on
in
a
small
scale
rather
than
in
exciting
unpleasant
curiosity
and
official
oppression
by
turning
up
his
jug
and
attempting
to
produce
wine
at
wholesale
the
dog
and
cat
knew
the
secret
and
had
ever
a
watchful
eye
upon
the
jug
which
was
never
for
a
moment
out
of
sight
of
one
of
the
three
pairs
of
eyes
as
the
brightest
day
must
end
in
gloom
however
so
was
this
pleasant
state
soon
to
be
marred
by
a
most
sad
and
accident
one
day
the
news
flashed
around
the
neighborhood
that
the
old
supply
of
wine
was
exhausted
not
a
drop
remained
in
his
jug
and
he
had
no
more
with
which
to
refill
it
each
man
on
hearing
the
news
ran
to
see
if
it
were
indeed
true
and
the
little
hut
and
its
small
court
encircled
by
a
mud
wall
were
soon
filled
with
anxious
seekers
after
the
truth
the
old
man
admitted
the
statement
to
be
true
but
had
little
to
say
while
the
dog
ears
hung
neglectedly
over
his
cheeks
his
eyes
dropped
and
he
looked
as
though
he
might
be
asleep
but
for
the
persistent
manner
in
which
he
refused
to
lie
down
but
dignifiedly
bore
his
portion
of
the
sorrow
sitting
upright
but
with
bowed
head
thomas
seemed
to
have
been
charged
with
agitation
enough
for
the
whole
family
he
walked
nervously
about
the
floor
till
he
felt
that
justice
to
his
tail
demanded
a
higher
plane
where
shoes
could
not
offend
and
then
betook
himself
to
the
counter
and
later
to
the
beam
which
supported
the
roof
and
made
a
sort
of
cats
and
attic
under
the
thatch
all
condoled
with
the
old
man
and
not
one
but
regretted
that
their
supply
of
cheap
good
wine
was
exhausted
the
old
man
offered
no
explanation
though
he
had
about
concluded
in
his
own
mind
that
as
no
one
knew
the
secret
he
must
have
in
some
way
poured
the
bit
of
amber
into
a
customer
jug
but
who
possessed
the
jug
he
could
not
surmise
nor
could
he
think
of
any
way
of
reclaiming
it
he
talked
the
matter
over
carefully
and
fully
to
himself
at
night
and
the
dog
and
cat
listened
attentively
winking
knowingly
at
each
other
and
puzzling
their
brains
much
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
and
how
they
were
to
assist
their
kind
old
friend
at
last
the
old
man
fell
asleep
and
then
sitting
down
face
to
face
by
his
side
the
dog
and
cat
began
a
discussion
i
am
sure
says
the
cat
that
i
can
detect
that
thing
if
i
only
come
within
smelling
distance
of
it
but
how
do
we
know
where
to
look
for
it
that
was
a
puzzler
but
the
dog
proposed
that
they
make
a
search
through
every
house
in
the
neighborhood
we
can
go
on
a
mere
kuh
kyung
look
see
you
know
and
while
you
call
on
the
cats
indoors
and
keep
your
smellers
open
i
will
yay
gee
chat
with
the
dogs
outside
and
if
you
smell
any
thing
you
can
tell
me
the
plan
seemed
to
be
the
only
good
one
and
it
was
adopted
that
very
night
they
were
not
cast
down
because
the
first
search
was
unsuccessful
and
continued
their
work
night
after
night
sometimes
their
calls
were
not
appreciated
and
in
a
few
cases
they
had
to
clear
the
field
by
battle
before
they
could
go
on
with
the
search
no
house
was
neglected
however
and
in
due
time
they
had
done
the
whole
neighborhood
but
with
no
success
they
then
determined
that
it
must
have
been
carried
to
the
other
side
of
the
river
to
which
place
they
decided
to
extend
their
search
as
soon
as
the
water
was
frozen
over
so
that
they
could
cross
on
the
ice
for
they
knew
they
would
not
be
allowed
in
the
crowded
and
while
the
dog
could
swim
he
knew
that
the
water
was
too
icy
for
that
as
it
soon
grew
very
cold
the
river
froze
so
solidly
that
ponies
and
all
passed
over
on
the
ice
and
so
it
remained
for
near
two
months
allowing
the
searching
party
to
return
each
morning
to
their
poor
old
master
who
seemed
completely
broken
up
by
his
loss
and
did
not
venture
away
from
his
door
except
to
buy
the
few
provisions
which
his
little
fund
of
savings
would
allow
time
flew
by
without
bringing
success
to
the
faithful
comrades
and
the
old
man
began
to
think
they
too
were
deserting
him
as
his
old
customers
had
done
it
was
nearing
the
time
for
the
spring
thaw
and
freshet
when
one
night
as
the
cat
was
chasing
around
over
the
roof
timbers
in
a
house
away
to
the
outside
of
the
settlement
across
the
river
he
detected
an
odor
that
caused
him
to
stop
so
suddenly
as
to
nearly
precipitate
himself
upon
a
sleeping
man
on
the
floor
below
he
carefully
traced
up
the
odor
and
found
that
it
came
from
a
soapstone
tobacco
box
that
sat
upon
the
top
of
a
high
near
by
the
box
was
dusty
with
neglect
and
thomas
concluded
that
the
possessor
had
accidentally
turned
the
coveted
gem
for
it
was
from
that
the
odor
came
out
into
his
wine
bowl
and
not
knowing
its
nature
had
put
it
into
this
stone
box
rather
than
throw
it
away
the
lid
was
so
securely
fastened
that
the
box
seemed
to
be
one
solid
piece
and
in
despair
of
opening
it
the
cat
went
out
to
consult
the
superior
wisdom
of
the
dog
and
see
what
could
be
done
i
ca
get
up
there
said
the
dog
nor
can
you
bring
me
the
box
or
i
might
break
it
i
can
not
move
the
thing
or
i
might
push
it
off
and
let
it
fall
to
the
floor
and
break
said
the
cat
so
after
explaining
the
things
they
could
not
do
the
dog
finally
hit
upon
a
plan
they
might
perhaps
successfully
carry
out
i
will
tell
you
said
he
you
go
and
see
the
chief
of
the
rat
guild
in
this
neighborhood
tell
him
that
if
he
will
help
you
in
this
matter
we
will
both
let
him
alone
for
ten
years
and
not
hurt
even
a
mouse
of
them
but
what
good
is
that
going
to
do
why
do
you
see
that
stone
is
no
harder
than
some
wood
and
they
can
take
turns
at
it
till
they
gnaw
a
hole
through
then
we
can
easily
get
the
gem
the
cat
bowed
before
the
marvellous
judgment
of
the
dog
and
went
off
to
accomplish
the
somewhat
difficult
task
of
obtaining
an
interview
with
the
master
rat
meanwhile
the
dog
wagged
his
ears
and
tail
and
strode
about
with
a
swinging
stride
in
imitation
of
the
great
yang
ban
or
official
who
occasionally
walked
past
his
door
and
who
seemed
to
denote
by
his
haughty
gait
his
superiority
to
other
men
his
importance
made
him
impudent
and
when
the
cat
returned
to
his
dismay
he
found
his
friend
engaged
in
a
genuine
fight
with
a
lot
of
curs
who
had
dared
to
intrude
upon
his
period
of
thomas
mounted
the
nearest
wall
and
howled
so
lustily
that
the
inmates
of
the
house
awakened
by
the
uproar
came
out
and
dispersed
the
contestants
the
cat
had
found
the
rat
who
upon
being
assured
of
safety
came
to
the
mouth
of
his
hole
and
listened
attentively
to
the
proposition
it
is
needless
to
say
he
accepted
it
and
a
contract
was
made
forthwith
it
was
arranged
that
work
was
to
begin
at
once
and
be
continued
by
relays
as
long
as
they
could
work
undisturbed
and
when
the
box
was
perforated
the
cat
was
to
be
summoned
the
ice
had
now
broken
up
and
the
pair
could
not
return
home
very
easily
so
they
waited
about
the
neighborhood
for
some
months
picking
up
a
scant
living
and
making
many
friends
and
not
a
few
enemies
for
they
were
a
proud
pair
and
ready
to
fight
on
provocation
it
was
warm
weather
when
one
night
the
cat
almost
forgot
his
compact
as
he
saw
a
big
fat
rat
slinking
along
towards
him
he
crouched
low
and
dug
his
long
claws
into
the
earth
while
every
nerve
seemed
on
the
jump
but
before
he
was
ready
to
spring
upon
his
prey
he
fortunately
remembered
his
contract
it
was
just
in
time
too
for
as
the
rat
was
none
other
than
the
other
party
to
the
contract
such
a
mistake
at
that
time
would
have
been
fatal
to
their
object
the
rat
announced
that
the
hole
was
completed
but
was
so
small
at
the
inside
end
that
they
were
at
a
loss
to
know
how
to
get
the
gem
out
unless
the
cat
could
reach
it
with
his
paw
having
acquainted
the
dog
with
the
good
news
the
cat
hurried
off
to
see
for
himself
he
could
introduce
his
paw
but
as
the
object
was
at
the
other
end
of
the
box
he
could
not
quite
reach
it
they
were
in
a
dilemma
and
were
about
to
give
up
when
the
cat
went
again
to
consult
with
the
dog
the
latter
promptly
told
them
to
put
a
mouse
into
the
box
and
let
him
bring
out
the
gem
they
did
so
but
the
hole
was
too
small
for
the
little
fellow
and
his
load
to
get
out
at
the
same
time
so
that
much
pushing
and
pulling
had
to
be
done
before
they
were
successful
they
got
it
safely
at
last
however
and
gave
it
at
once
to
the
dog
for
then
with
much
purring
and
wagging
of
tails
the
contract
of
friendship
was
again
renewed
and
the
strange
party
broke
up
the
rats
to
go
and
jubilate
over
their
safety
the
dog
and
cat
to
carry
the
good
news
to
their
mourning
master
again
canine
wisdom
was
called
into
play
in
devising
a
means
for
crossing
the
river
the
now
happy
dog
was
equal
to
such
a
trifling
thing
as
this
however
and
instructed
the
cat
that
he
must
take
the
gem
in
his
mouth
hold
it
well
between
his
teeth
and
then
mount
his
the
dog
back
where
he
could
hold
on
firmly
to
the
long
hair
of
his
neck
while
he
swam
across
the
river
this
was
agreed
upon
and
arriving
at
the
river
they
put
the
plan
into
execution
all
went
well
until
as
they
neared
the
opposite
bank
a
party
of
chanced
to
notice
them
coming
and
after
their
amazement
at
the
strange
sight
wore
away
they
burst
into
uproarious
laughter
which
increased
the
more
they
looked
at
the
absurd
sight
they
clapped
their
hands
and
danced
with
glee
while
some
fell
on
the
ground
and
rolled
about
in
an
exhaustion
of
merriment
at
seeing
a
cat
astride
a
back
being
ferried
across
the
river
the
dog
was
too
weary
and
consequently
to
see
much
fun
in
it
but
the
cat
shook
his
sides
till
his
agitation
caused
the
dog
to
take
in
great
gulps
of
water
in
attempting
to
keep
his
head
up
this
but
increased
the
cat
merriment
till
he
broke
out
in
a
laugh
as
hearty
as
that
of
the
children
and
in
doing
so
dropped
the
precious
gem
into
the
water
the
dog
seeing
the
sad
accident
dove
at
once
for
the
gem
regardless
of
the
cat
who
could
not
let
go
in
time
to
escape
and
was
dragged
down
under
the
water
sticking
his
claws
into
the
dog
skin
in
his
agony
of
suffocation
he
caused
him
so
much
pain
that
he
missed
the
object
of
his
search
and
came
to
the
surface
the
cat
got
ashore
in
some
way
greatly
angered
at
the
dog
rude
conduct
the
latter
however
cared
little
for
that
and
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
the
water
from
his
hide
he
made
a
lunge
at
his
unlucky
companion
who
had
lost
the
results
of
a
half
year
faithful
work
in
one
moment
of
foolishness
dripping
like
a
drowned
cat
thomas
was
however
able
to
climb
a
tree
and
there
he
stayed
till
the
sun
had
dried
the
water
from
his
fur
and
he
had
spat
the
water
from
his
inwards
in
the
constant
spitting
he
kept
up
at
his
now
enemy
who
kept
barking
ferociously
about
the
tree
below
the
cat
knew
that
the
dog
was
dangerous
when
aroused
and
was
careful
not
to
descend
from
his
perch
till
the
coast
was
clear
though
at
one
time
he
really
feared
the
ugly
boys
would
knock
him
off
with
stones
as
they
passed
once
down
he
has
ever
since
been
careful
to
avoid
the
dog
with
whom
he
has
never
patched
up
the
quarrel
nor
does
he
wish
to
do
so
for
the
very
sight
of
a
dog
causes
him
to
recall
that
horrible
cold
ducking
and
the
day
spent
up
a
tree
and
involuntarily
he
spits
as
though
still
filled
with
and
his
tail
blows
up
as
it
had
never
learned
to
do
till
the
day
when
for
so
long
its
damp
and
draggled
condition
would
not
permit
of
its
assuming
the
haughty
shape
this
accounts
for
the
scarcity
of
cats
and
the
popularity
of
dogs
the
dog
did
not
give
up
his
efforts
even
now
he
dove
many
times
in
vain
and
spent
most
of
the
following
days
sitting
on
the
river
bank
apparently
lost
in
thought
thus
the
winter
found
him
his
two
chief
aims
apparently
being
to
find
the
gem
and
to
kill
the
cat
the
latter
kept
well
out
of
his
way
and
the
ice
now
covered
the
place
where
the
former
lay
hidden
one
day
he
espied
a
man
spearing
fish
through
a
hole
in
the
ice
as
was
very
common
having
a
natural
desire
to
be
around
where
any
thing
eatable
was
being
displayed
and
feeling
a
sort
of
proprietorship
in
the
particular
part
of
the
river
where
the
man
was
fishing
and
where
he
himself
had
had
such
a
sad
experience
he
went
down
and
looked
on
as
a
fish
came
up
something
natural
seemed
to
greet
his
nostrils
and
then
as
the
man
lay
down
his
catch
the
dog
grabbed
it
and
rushed
off
in
the
greatest
haste
he
ran
with
all
his
might
to
his
master
who
poor
man
was
now
at
the
end
of
his
string
coin
in
korea
is
perforated
and
strung
on
a
string
and
was
almost
reduced
to
begging
he
was
therefore
delighted
when
his
faithful
old
friend
brought
him
so
acceptable
a
present
as
a
fresh
fish
he
at
once
commenced
dressing
it
but
when
he
slit
it
open
to
his
infinite
joy
his
gem
fell
out
of
the
fish
belly
the
dog
was
too
happy
to
contain
himself
but
jumping
upon
his
master
he
licked
him
with
his
tongue
and
struck
him
with
his
paws
barking
meanwhile
as
though
he
had
again
treed
the
cat
as
soon
as
their
joy
had
become
somewhat
natural
the
old
man
carefully
placed
the
gem
in
his
trunk
from
which
he
took
the
last
money
he
had
together
with
some
fine
clothes
relics
of
his
more
fortunate
days
he
had
feared
he
must
soon
pawn
these
clothes
and
had
even
shown
them
to
the
brokers
but
now
he
took
them
out
to
put
them
on
as
his
fortune
had
returned
to
him
leaving
the
fish
baking
on
the
coals
he
donned
his
fine
clothes
and
taking
his
last
money
he
went
and
purchased
wine
for
his
feast
and
for
a
beginning
for
he
knew
that
once
he
placed
the
gem
back
in
the
jug
the
supply
of
wine
would
not
cease
on
his
return
he
and
the
good
dog
made
a
happy
feast
of
the
generous
fish
and
the
old
man
completely
recovered
his
spirits
when
he
had
quaffed
deeply
of
the
familiar
liquid
to
which
his
mouth
was
now
such
a
stranger
going
to
his
trunk
directly
he
found
to
his
amazement
that
it
contained
another
suit
of
clothes
exactly
like
the
first
ones
he
had
removed
while
there
lay
also
a
broken
string
of
cash
of
just
the
amount
which
he
had
previously
taken
out
sitting
down
to
think
the
whole
truth
dawned
upon
him
and
he
then
saw
how
he
had
abused
his
privilege
before
in
being
content
to
use
his
talisman
simply
to
run
a
while
he
might
have
had
money
and
every
thing
else
in
abundance
by
simply
giving
the
charm
a
chance
to
work
acting
upon
this
principle
the
old
man
eventually
became
immensely
wealthy
for
he
could
always
duplicate
any
thing
with
his
piece
of
amber
he
carefully
tended
his
faithful
dog
who
never
in
his
remaining
days
molested
a
rat
and
never
lost
an
opportunity
to
attack
every
cat
he
saw
ching
yuh
and
kyain
oo
the
trials
of
two
heavenly
lovers
prelude
ching
yuh
and
kyain
oo
were
stars
attendant
upon
the
sun
they
fell
madly
in
love
with
each
other
and
obtaining
the
royal
permission
they
were
married
it
was
to
them
a
most
happy
union
and
having
reached
the
consummation
of
their
joys
they
lived
only
for
one
another
and
sought
only
each
other
company
they
were
continually
in
each
other
embrace
and
as
the
bade
fair
to
continue
during
the
rest
of
their
lives
rendering
them
unfit
for
the
discharge
of
their
duties
their
master
decided
to
punish
them
he
therefore
banished
them
one
to
the
farthest
edge
of
the
eastern
heavens
the
other
to
the
extreme
opposite
side
of
the
great
river
that
divides
the
heavenly
plains
the
milky
way
they
were
sent
so
far
away
that
it
required
full
six
months
to
make
the
journey
or
a
whole
year
to
go
and
come
as
they
must
be
at
their
post
at
the
annual
inspection
they
therefore
could
only
hope
to
journey
back
and
forth
for
the
scant
comfort
of
spending
one
short
night
in
each
other
company
even
should
they
violate
their
orders
and
risk
punishment
by
returning
sooner
they
could
only
see
each
other
from
either
bank
of
the
broad
river
which
they
could
only
hope
to
cross
at
the
season
when
the
great
bridge
is
completed
by
the
crows
who
carry
the
materials
for
its
construction
upon
their
heads
as
any
one
may
know
who
cares
to
notice
how
bald
and
worn
are
the
heads
of
the
crows
during
the
seventh
moon
naturally
this
fond
couple
are
always
and
discouraged
at
being
so
soon
compelled
to
part
after
such
a
brief
but
meeting
and
is
not
strange
that
their
grief
should
manifest
itself
in
weeping
tears
so
copious
that
the
whole
earth
beneath
is
deluged
with
rains
this
sad
meeting
occurs
on
the
night
of
the
seventh
day
of
the
seventh
moon
unless
prevented
by
some
untoward
circumstance
in
which
case
the
usual
rainy
season
is
withheld
and
the
parched
earth
then
unites
in
lamentation
with
the
fond
lovers
whose
increased
trials
so
sadden
their
hearts
that
even
the
fountain
of
tears
refuses
to
flow
for
their
relief
i
you
tah
jung
was
a
very
wise
official
and
a
remarkably
good
man
he
could
ill
endure
the
corrupt
practices
of
many
of
his
associate
officials
and
becoming
dissatisfied
with
life
at
court
he
sought
and
obtained
permission
to
retire
from
official
life
and
go
to
the
country
his
marriage
had
fortunately
been
a
happy
one
hence
he
was
the
more
content
with
the
somewhat
solitary
life
he
now
began
to
lead
his
wife
was
peculiarly
gifted
and
they
were
in
perfect
sympathy
with
each
other
so
that
they
longed
not
for
the
society
of
others
they
had
one
desire
however
that
was
ever
before
them
and
that
could
not
be
laid
aside
they
had
no
children
not
even
a
daughter
had
been
granted
them
as
you
tah
jung
superintended
the
cultivation
of
his
estate
he
felt
that
he
would
be
wholly
happy
and
content
were
it
not
for
the
lack
of
offspring
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
fascinating
pastime
of
fishing
and
took
great
delight
in
spending
the
most
of
his
time
in
the
fields
listening
to
the
birds
and
absorbing
wisdom
with
peace
and
contentment
from
nature
as
spring
brought
the
mating
and
budding
season
however
he
again
got
to
brooding
over
his
unfortunate
condition
for
as
he
was
the
last
of
an
illustrious
family
the
line
seemed
like
to
cease
with
his
childless
life
he
knew
of
the
displeasure
his
ancestors
would
experience
and
that
he
would
be
unable
to
face
them
in
paradise
while
he
would
leave
no
one
to
bow
before
his
grave
and
make
offerings
to
his
spirit
again
he
bemoaned
their
condition
with
his
poor
wife
who
begged
him
to
avail
himself
of
his
prerogative
and
remove
their
reproach
by
marrying
another
wife
this
he
stoutly
refused
to
do
as
he
would
not
risk
ruining
his
now
pleasant
home
by
bringing
another
wife
and
the
usual
discord
into
it
instead
of
estranging
them
their
misfortune
seemed
but
to
bind
this
pair
the
closer
together
they
were
very
devout
people
and
they
prayed
to
heaven
continually
for
a
son
one
night
the
wife
fell
asleep
while
praying
and
dreamed
a
remarkable
dream
she
fancied
that
she
saw
a
commotion
in
the
vicinity
of
the
north
star
and
presently
a
most
beautiful
boy
came
down
to
her
riding
upon
a
wonderful
fan
made
of
white
feathers
the
boy
came
direct
to
her
and
made
a
low
obeisance
upon
which
she
asked
him
who
he
was
and
where
he
came
from
he
said
i
am
the
attendant
of
the
great
north
star
and
because
of
a
mistake
i
fell
into
he
banished
me
to
earth
for
a
term
of
years
telling
me
to
come
to
you
and
bring
this
fan
which
will
eventually
be
the
means
of
saving
your
life
and
my
own
in
the
intensity
of
her
joy
she
awoke
and
found
to
her
infinite
sorrow
that
the
beautiful
vision
was
but
a
dream
she
cherished
it
in
her
mind
however
and
was
transported
with
joy
when
a
beautiful
boy
came
to
them
with
the
succeeding
the
beauty
of
the
child
was
the
comment
of
the
neighborhood
and
every
one
loved
him
as
he
grew
older
it
was
noticed
that
the
graces
of
his
mind
were
even
more
remarkable
than
those
of
his
person
the
next
ten
years
were
simply
one
unending
period
of
blissful
contentment
in
the
happy
country
home
they
called
the
boy
pang
noo
his
family
name
being
you
made
him
you
pang
noo
his
mother
taught
him
his
early
lessons
herself
but
by
the
expiration
of
his
first
ten
years
he
had
grown
far
beyond
her
powers
and
his
brilliant
mind
even
taxed
his
intelligent
father
in
his
attempts
to
keep
pace
with
him
about
this
time
they
learned
of
a
wonderful
teacher
a
nam
juh
oon
whose
ability
was
of
great
repute
it
was
decided
that
the
boy
should
be
sent
to
this
man
to
school
and
great
was
the
agitation
and
sorrow
at
home
at
thought
of
the
separation
he
was
made
ready
however
and
with
the
benediction
of
father
and
caresses
of
mother
he
started
for
his
new
teacher
bearing
with
him
a
wonderful
feather
fan
which
his
father
had
given
him
and
which
had
descended
from
his
this
he
was
to
guard
with
especial
care
as
since
his
mother
remarkable
dream
preceding
his
birth
it
was
believed
that
this
old
family
relic
which
bore
such
a
likeness
to
the
fan
of
the
dream
was
to
prove
a
talisman
to
him
and
by
it
evil
was
to
be
warded
off
and
good
brought
down
upon
him
ii
strange
as
it
may
seem
events
very
similar
in
nature
to
those
just
narrated
were
taking
place
in
a
neighboring
district
where
lived
another
exemplary
man
named
cho
sung
noo
he
was
a
man
of
great
rank
but
was
not
in
active
service
at
present
simply
because
of
induced
by
constant
brooding
over
his
for
like
you
tah
jung
he
was
the
last
of
an
illustrious
family
and
had
no
offspring
he
was
so
happily
married
furthermore
that
he
had
never
taken
a
second
wife
and
would
not
do
so
about
the
time
of
the
events
just
related
concerning
the
you
family
the
wife
of
cho
who
had
never
neglected
bowing
to
heaven
and
requesting
a
child
dreamed
she
had
gone
to
a
apart
from
the
house
and
sitting
in
the
moonlight
on
a
clean
plat
of
ground
free
from
the
litter
of
the
domestic
animals
she
was
gazing
into
the
heavens
hoping
to
witness
the
meeting
of
ching
yuh
and
kyain
oo
and
feeling
sad
at
the
thought
of
their
fabled
tribulations
while
thus
engaged
she
fell
asleep
and
while
sleeping
dreamed
that
the
four
winds
were
bearing
to
her
a
beautiful
litter
supported
upon
five
rich
soft
clouds
in
the
chair
reclined
a
beautiful
little
girl
far
lovelier
than
any
being
she
had
ever
dreamed
of
before
and
the
like
of
which
is
never
seen
in
real
life
the
chair
itself
was
made
of
gold
and
jade
as
the
procession
drew
nearer
the
dreamer
exclaimed
who
are
you
my
beautiful
child
oh
replied
the
child
i
am
glad
you
think
me
beautiful
for
then
may
be
you
will
let
me
stay
with
you
i
think
i
should
like
to
have
you
very
much
but
you
have
yet
answered
my
question
well
she
said
i
was
an
attendant
upon
the
queen
of
heaven
but
i
have
been
very
bad
though
i
meant
no
wrong
and
i
am
banished
to
earth
for
a
season
wo
you
let
me
live
with
you
please
i
shall
be
delighted
my
child
for
we
have
no
children
but
what
did
you
do
that
the
stars
should
banish
you
from
their
midst
well
i
will
tell
you
she
answered
you
see
when
the
annual
union
of
ching
yuh
and
kyain
oo
takes
place
i
hear
them
mourning
because
they
can
only
see
each
other
once
a
year
while
mortal
pairs
have
each
other
company
constantly
they
never
consider
that
while
mortals
have
but
eighty
years
of
life
at
most
their
lives
are
without
limit
and
they
therefore
have
each
other
to
a
greater
extent
than
do
the
mortals
whom
they
selfishly
envy
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
i
determined
to
teach
this
unhappy
couple
a
lesson
consequently
on
the
last
seventh
moon
seventh
day
when
the
bridge
was
about
completed
and
ready
for
the
eager
pair
to
cross
heaven
river
to
each
others
embrace
i
drove
the
crows
away
and
ruined
their
bridge
before
they
could
reach
each
other
i
did
it
for
mischief
true
and
did
not
count
on
the
drought
that
would
occur
but
for
my
misconduct
and
the
consequent
suffering
entailed
on
mortals
i
am
banished
and
i
trust
you
will
take
and
care
for
me
kind
lady
when
she
had
finished
speaking
the
winds
began
to
blow
around
as
though
in
preparation
for
departure
with
the
chair
minus
its
occupant
then
the
woman
awoke
and
found
it
but
a
dream
though
the
winds
were
indeed
blowing
about
her
so
as
to
cause
her
to
feel
quite
chilly
the
dream
left
a
pleasant
impression
and
when
to
their
intense
joy
a
daughter
was
really
born
to
them
the
fond
parents
could
scarcely
be
blamed
for
associating
her
somewhat
with
the
vision
of
the
ravishing
dream
the
child
was
a
marvel
of
beauty
and
her
development
was
rapid
and
perfect
the
neighbors
were
so
charmed
with
her
that
some
of
them
seemed
to
think
she
was
really
supernatural
and
she
was
popularly
known
as
the
divine
maiden
before
her
first
ten
years
were
finished
it
was
about
the
time
of
her
tenth
birthday
that
little
uhn
hah
had
the
interesting
encounter
upon
which
her
whole
future
was
to
hinge
it
happened
in
this
way
one
day
she
was
riding
along
on
her
back
on
her
way
to
visit
her
grandmother
coming
to
a
nice
shady
spot
they
sat
down
by
the
to
rest
while
they
were
sitting
there
along
came
pang
noo
on
his
way
to
school
as
uhn
hah
was
still
but
a
girl
she
was
not
veiled
and
the
lad
was
confronted
with
her
matchless
beauty
which
seemed
to
intoxicate
him
he
could
not
pass
by
neither
could
he
find
words
to
utter
but
at
last
he
bethought
him
of
an
expedient
seeing
some
oranges
in
her
lap
he
stepped
up
and
spoke
politely
to
the
nurse
saying
i
am
you
pang
noo
a
lad
on
my
way
to
school
and
i
am
very
thirsty
wo
you
ask
your
little
girl
to
let
me
have
one
of
her
oranges
uhn
hah
was
likewise
smitten
with
the
charms
of
the
beautiful
lad
and
in
her
confusion
she
gave
him
two
oranges
pang
noo
gallantly
said
i
wish
to
give
you
something
in
return
for
your
kindness
and
if
you
will
allow
me
i
will
write
your
name
on
this
fan
and
present
it
to
you
having
obtained
the
name
and
permission
he
wrote
no
girl
was
ever
possessed
of
such
incomparable
graces
as
the
beautiful
uhn
hah
i
now
betroth
myself
to
her
and
vow
never
to
marry
other
so
long
as
i
live
he
handed
her
the
fan
and
feasting
his
eyes
on
her
beauty
they
separated
the
fan
being
closed
no
one
read
the
characters
and
uhn
hah
carefully
put
it
away
for
safe
keeping
without
examining
it
sufficiently
close
to
discover
the
written
sentiment
iii
pang
noo
went
to
school
and
worked
steadily
for
three
years
he
learned
amazingly
fast
and
did
far
more
in
three
years
than
the
brightest
pupils
usually
do
in
ten
his
noted
teacher
soon
found
that
the
boy
could
even
lead
him
and
it
became
evident
that
further
stay
at
the
school
was
unnecessary
the
boy
also
was
very
anxious
to
go
and
see
his
parents
at
last
he
bade
his
teacher
to
the
sorrow
of
both
for
their
companionship
had
been
very
pleasant
and
profitable
and
they
had
more
than
the
usual
attachment
of
teacher
and
pupil
for
each
other
pang
noo
and
his
attendant
journeyed
leisurely
to
their
home
where
they
were
received
with
the
greatest
delight
his
mother
had
not
seen
her
son
during
his
schooling
and
even
her
fond
pride
was
hardly
prepared
for
the
great
improvement
the
boy
had
made
both
in
body
and
mind
since
last
she
saw
him
the
father
eventually
asked
to
see
the
ancestral
fan
he
had
given
him
and
the
boy
had
to
confess
that
he
had
it
not
giving
as
an
excuse
that
he
had
lost
it
on
the
road
his
father
could
not
conceal
his
anger
and
for
some
time
their
pleasure
was
marred
by
this
unfortunate
circumstance
such
a
youth
and
an
only
son
could
not
long
remain
unforgiven
however
and
soon
all
was
forgotten
and
he
enjoyed
the
fullest
love
of
his
parents
and
admiration
of
his
friends
as
he
quietly
pursued
his
studies
and
recreation
in
this
way
he
came
down
to
his
sixteenth
year
the
pride
of
the
neighborhood
his
quiet
was
remarked
but
no
one
knew
the
secret
cause
and
how
much
of
his
apparent
studious
attention
was
devoted
to
the
charming
little
maiden
image
that
was
framed
in
his
mental
vision
about
this
time
a
very
great
official
from
the
neighborhood
called
upon
his
father
and
after
the
usual
formalities
announced
that
he
had
heard
of
the
remarkable
son
you
tah
jung
was
the
father
of
and
he
had
come
to
consult
upon
the
advisability
of
uniting
their
families
as
he
himself
had
been
blessed
with
a
daughter
who
was
beautiful
and
accomplished
you
tah
jung
was
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
making
such
a
fine
alliance
for
his
son
and
gave
his
immediate
consent
but
to
his
dismay
his
son
objected
so
strenuously
and
withal
so
honorably
that
the
proposition
had
to
be
declined
as
graciously
as
the
rather
awkward
circumstances
would
allow
both
men
being
sensible
however
they
but
admired
the
boy
the
more
for
the
clever
rascal
had
begged
his
father
to
postpone
all
matrimonial
matters
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
till
he
had
been
able
to
make
a
name
for
himself
and
had
secured
rank
that
he
might
merit
such
attention
pang
noo
was
soon
to
have
an
opportunity
to
distinguish
himself
a
great
quaga
examination
was
to
be
held
at
the
capital
and
pang
noo
announced
his
intention
of
entering
the
lists
and
competing
for
civil
rank
his
father
was
glad
and
in
due
time
started
him
off
in
proper
style
the
examination
was
held
in
a
great
enclosure
at
the
rear
of
the
palace
where
the
king
and
his
counsellors
sat
in
a
pavilion
upon
a
raised
stage
of
masonry
the
hundreds
of
men
and
youths
from
all
parts
of
the
country
were
seated
upon
the
ground
under
large
umbrellas
pang
noo
was
given
a
subject
and
soon
finished
his
essay
after
which
he
folded
it
up
carefully
and
tossed
the
manuscript
over
a
wall
into
an
enclosure
where
it
was
received
and
delivered
to
the
board
of
examiners
these
gentlemen
as
well
as
his
majesty
were
at
once
struck
with
the
rare
merit
of
the
production
and
made
instant
inquiry
concerning
the
writer
of
course
he
was
successful
and
a
herald
soon
announced
that
pang
the
son
of
you
tah
jung
had
taken
the
highest
honors
he
was
summoned
before
the
king
who
was
pleased
with
the
young
man
brightness
and
wisdom
in
addition
to
his
own
rank
his
father
was
made
governor
of
a
province
and
made
haste
to
come
to
court
and
thank
his
sovereign
for
the
double
honor
and
to
congratulate
his
son
pang
was
given
permission
to
go
and
bow
at
the
tomb
of
his
ancestors
in
grateful
acknowledgment
for
heaven
blessings
having
done
which
he
went
to
pay
his
respects
to
his
mother
who
fairly
worshipped
her
son
now
if
she
had
not
done
so
before
during
his
absence
the
king
had
authorized
the
board
of
appointments
to
give
him
the
high
rank
of
ussa
for
though
he
was
young
his
majesty
thought
one
so
wise
and
quick
well
fitted
to
travel
in
disguise
and
spy
out
the
acts
of
evil
officials
learn
the
condition
of
the
people
and
bring
the
corrupt
and
usurous
to
punishment
pang
noo
was
amazed
at
his
success
yet
the
position
just
suited
him
for
aside
from
a
desire
to
better
the
condition
of
his
he
felt
that
in
this
position
he
would
be
apt
to
learn
the
whereabouts
of
his
whose
beautiful
vision
was
ever
before
him
donning
a
suitable
disguise
therefore
he
set
out
upon
the
business
at
hand
with
a
light
heart
iv
uhn
hah
during
all
this
time
had
been
progressing
in
a
quiet
way
as
a
girl
should
but
she
also
was
quite
the
wonder
of
her
neighborhood
all
this
time
she
had
had
many
if
not
constant
dreams
of
the
handsome
youth
she
had
met
by
the
roadside
she
had
lived
over
the
incident
time
and
again
and
many
a
time
did
she
take
down
and
gaze
upon
the
beautiful
fan
which
however
opened
and
closed
in
such
a
manner
that
ordinarily
the
characters
were
concealed
at
last
however
she
discovered
them
and
great
was
her
surprise
and
delight
at
the
message
she
dwelt
on
it
much
and
finally
concluded
it
was
a
heaven
arranged
union
and
as
the
lad
had
pledged
his
faith
to
her
she
vowed
she
would
be
his
or
never
marry
at
all
this
thought
she
nourished
longing
to
see
pang
noo
and
wondering
how
she
should
ever
find
him
till
she
began
to
regard
herself
as
really
the
wife
of
her
lover
about
this
time
one
of
his
majesty
greatest
generals
who
had
a
reputation
for
bravery
and
cruelty
as
well
came
to
stop
at
his
country
holding
near
by
and
hearing
of
the
remarkable
girl
daughter
of
the
retired
but
very
honorable
brother
official
he
made
a
call
at
the
house
of
cho
and
explained
that
he
was
willing
to
betroth
his
son
to
cho
daughter
the
matter
was
considered
at
length
and
cho
gave
his
willing
consent
upon
the
departure
of
the
general
the
father
went
to
acquaint
his
daughter
with
her
good
fortune
upon
hearing
it
she
seemed
struck
dumb
and
then
began
to
weep
and
moan
as
though
some
great
calamity
had
befallen
her
she
could
say
nothing
nor
bear
to
hear
any
more
said
of
the
matter
she
could
neither
eat
nor
sleep
and
the
roses
fled
from
her
cheeks
her
parents
were
dismayed
but
wisely
abstained
from
troubling
her
her
mother
however
betimes
lovingly
coaxed
her
daughter
to
confide
in
her
but
it
was
long
before
the
girl
could
bring
herself
to
disclose
a
secret
so
peculiar
and
apparently
so
unwomanly
the
mother
prevailed
at
last
and
the
whole
story
of
the
early
infatuation
eventually
came
forth
he
has
pledged
himself
to
me
she
said
he
recognized
me
at
sight
as
his
bride
and
i
have
pledged
myself
to
him
i
can
not
marry
another
and
should
i
never
find
him
on
earth
this
fan
shall
be
my
husband
till
death
liberates
my
spirit
to
join
his
in
the
skies
she
enumerated
his
great
charms
of
manner
and
person
and
begged
her
mother
not
to
press
this
other
marriage
upon
her
but
rather
let
her
die
insisting
however
that
should
she
die
her
mother
must
tell
pang
noo
how
true
she
had
been
to
him
the
father
was
in
a
great
dilemma
why
did
you
not
tell
this
to
your
mother
before
here
the
general
has
done
me
the
honor
to
ask
that
our
families
be
united
and
i
have
consented
now
i
must
decline
and
his
anger
will
be
so
great
that
he
will
ruin
me
at
the
capitol
and
then
after
all
this
is
but
an
absurd
piece
of
childish
foolishness
your
fine
young
man
had
he
half
the
graces
you
give
him
would
have
been
betrothed
long
before
this
no
no
she
exclaimed
he
has
pledged
himself
and
i
know
he
is
even
now
coming
to
me
he
will
not
marry
another
nor
can
i
would
you
ask
one
woman
to
marry
two
men
yet
that
is
what
you
ask
in
this
for
i
am
already
the
wife
of
pang
noo
in
my
heart
kill
me
if
you
will
but
spare
me
this
i
beg
and
entreat
and
she
writhed
about
on
her
cot
crying
till
the
mat
was
saturated
with
her
tears
the
parents
loved
her
too
well
to
withstand
her
pleadings
and
resigning
themselves
to
the
inevitable
persecution
that
must
result
they
dispatched
a
letter
to
the
general
declining
his
kind
offer
in
as
unobjectionable
a
manner
as
possible
it
had
the
result
that
was
feared
the
general
in
a
towering
rage
sent
soldiers
to
arrest
cho
but
before
he
could
go
further
a
messenger
arrived
from
seoul
with
despatches
summoning
him
to
the
capitol
immediately
as
a
rebellion
had
broken
out
on
the
borders
before
leaving
however
he
instructed
the
local
magistrate
to
imprison
the
man
and
not
release
him
till
he
consented
to
the
marriage
it
chanced
that
the
magistrate
was
an
honest
man
and
knew
the
general
to
be
a
very
cruel
relentless
warrior
he
therefore
listened
to
cho
story
and
believed
the
strange
case
furthermore
his
love
for
the
girl
softened
his
heart
and
he
bade
them
to
collect
what
they
could
and
go
to
another
province
to
live
cho
did
so
with
deep
gratitude
to
the
magistrate
while
the
latter
wrote
to
the
general
that
the
prisoner
had
avoided
arrest
and
fled
to
unknown
parts
taking
his
family
with
him
poor
pang
noo
did
his
inspection
work
with
a
heavy
heart
as
time
wore
on
and
the
personal
object
of
his
search
was
not
attained
in
the
course
of
his
travels
he
finally
came
to
his
uncle
the
magistrate
who
had
dismissed
the
cho
family
the
uncle
welcomed
his
popular
nephew
right
warmly
but
questioned
him
much
as
to
the
cause
of
his
poor
health
and
haggard
looks
which
so
a
man
of
his
youth
and
prospects
at
last
the
kind
old
man
secured
the
secret
with
its
whole
story
and
then
it
was
his
turn
to
be
sad
for
had
he
not
just
sent
away
the
very
person
the
ussa
so
much
desired
to
see
when
pang
learned
this
his
malady
increased
and
he
declared
he
could
do
no
more
active
service
till
this
matter
was
cleared
up
consequently
he
sent
a
despatch
to
court
begging
to
be
released
as
he
was
in
such
poor
health
he
could
not
properly
discharge
his
arduous
duties
longer
his
request
was
granted
and
he
journeyed
to
seoul
hoping
to
find
some
trace
of
her
who
more
and
more
seemed
to
absorb
his
every
thought
and
ambition
vi
in
the
meantime
the
banished
family
and
had
settled
temporarily
in
a
distant
hamlet
where
the
worn
and
discouraged
parents
were
taken
sick
uhn
hah
did
all
she
could
for
them
but
in
spite
of
care
and
attention
in
spite
of
prayers
and
tears
they
passed
on
to
join
their
ancestors
the
poor
girl
beat
her
breast
and
tore
her
hair
in
an
agony
of
despair
alone
in
a
strange
country
with
no
money
and
no
one
to
shield
and
support
her
it
seemed
that
she
too
must
perforce
give
up
but
her
old
nurse
urged
her
to
cheer
up
and
suggested
their
donning
male
attire
in
which
disguise
they
could
safely
journey
to
another
place
unmolested
the
idea
seemed
a
good
one
and
it
was
adopted
they
allowed
their
hair
to
fall
down
the
back
in
a
long
braid
after
the
fashion
of
the
unmarried
men
and
putting
on
men
clothes
they
had
no
trouble
in
passing
unnoticed
along
the
roads
after
having
gone
but
a
short
distance
they
found
themselves
near
the
capital
of
the
province
the
home
of
the
governor
while
sitting
under
some
trees
by
the
roadside
the
governor
procession
passed
by
the
couple
arose
respectfully
but
the
governor
it
was
pang
noo
father
espying
the
peculiar
feather
fan
ordered
one
of
the
runners
to
seize
the
women
and
bring
them
along
it
was
done
and
when
they
were
arrived
at
the
official
yamen
he
questioned
the
supposed
man
as
to
where
he
had
secured
that
peculiar
fan
it
is
a
family
relic
replied
uhn
hah
to
the
intense
amazement
of
the
governor
who
pronounced
the
statement
false
as
the
fan
was
a
peculiar
feature
in
his
own
family
and
must
be
one
that
had
descended
from
his
own
ancestors
and
been
found
or
stolen
by
the
present
possessor
however
the
governor
offered
to
pay
a
good
round
sum
for
the
fan
but
uhn
hah
declared
she
would
die
rather
than
part
with
it
and
the
two
women
in
disguise
were
locked
up
in
prison
a
man
of
clever
speech
was
sent
to
interview
them
and
he
offered
them
a
considerable
sum
for
the
fan
which
the
servant
urged
uhn
hah
to
take
as
they
were
sadly
in
want
after
the
man
had
departed
in
disgust
however
the
girl
upbraided
her
old
nurse
roundly
for
forsaking
her
in
her
time
of
trial
my
parents
are
dead
she
said
all
i
have
to
represent
my
husband
is
this
fan
that
i
carry
in
my
bosom
would
you
rob
me
of
this
never
speak
so
again
if
you
wish
to
retain
my
love
and
weeping
she
fell
into
the
servant
arms
where
exhausted
and
overwrought
nature
asserting
itself
sleep
closed
her
eyes
while
sleeping
she
dreamed
of
a
wonderful
palace
on
high
where
she
saw
a
company
of
women
who
pointed
her
to
the
reeds
that
lined
the
river
bank
below
explaining
that
their
tears
had
turned
to
blood
during
their
long
search
for
their
lovers
and
dropping
on
the
reeds
they
were
dyed
one
of
them
prophesied
however
that
uhn
hah
was
to
be
given
superhuman
strength
and
powers
and
that
she
would
soon
succeed
in
finding
her
lover
who
was
now
a
high
official
and
so
true
to
her
that
he
was
sick
because
he
could
not
find
her
she
awakened
far
more
refreshed
by
the
dream
than
by
the
nap
and
was
soon
delighted
by
being
dismissed
the
governor
steward
took
pity
on
the
handsome
boy
and
gave
him
a
parting
gift
of
wine
and
food
to
carry
with
them
as
well
as
some
cash
to
help
them
on
and
bidding
him
the
women
announced
their
intention
of
travelling
to
a
distant
province
vii
meanwhile
pang
noo
had
reached
home
and
was
weary
both
in
body
and
mind
the
king
offered
him
service
at
court
but
he
asked
to
be
excused
and
seemed
to
wish
to
hide
himself
and
avoid
meeting
people
his
father
marvelled
much
at
this
and
again
urged
the
young
man
to
marry
but
this
seemed
only
to
aggravate
his
complaint
his
uncle
happened
to
come
to
his
father
gubernatorial
seat
on
a
business
errand
and
in
pity
for
the
young
man
explained
the
cause
of
the
trouble
to
the
father
he
saw
it
all
and
recalled
the
strange
beauty
of
the
lad
who
had
risked
his
life
for
the
possession
of
the
fan
and
as
the
uncle
told
the
story
of
her
excellent
parentage
and
the
trouble
and
death
that
resulted
from
the
refusal
to
marry
he
saw
through
the
whole
strange
train
of
circumstances
and
marvelled
that
heaven
should
have
selected
such
an
exemplary
maiden
for
his
son
and
then
as
he
realized
how
nearly
he
had
come
to
punishing
her
severely
for
her
persistent
refusal
to
surrender
the
fan
and
that
whereas
he
might
have
retained
her
and
united
her
to
his
son
he
had
sent
her
away
unattended
to
wander
alone
he
heaped
blame
upon
the
son
in
no
stinted
manner
for
his
lack
of
confidence
in
not
telling
his
father
his
troubles
the
attendants
were
carefully
questioned
concerning
the
conduct
of
the
strange
couple
while
in
custody
at
the
governor
yamen
and
as
to
the
probable
direction
they
took
in
departure
the
steward
alone
could
give
information
he
was
well
rewarded
for
having
shown
them
kindness
but
his
information
cast
a
gloom
upon
the
trio
for
he
said
they
had
started
for
the
district
where
civil
war
was
in
progress
you
unnatural
son
groaned
the
father
what
have
you
done
you
secretly
pledge
yourself
to
this
noble
girl
and
then
by
your
foolish
silence
twice
allow
her
to
escape
while
you
came
near
being
the
cause
of
her
death
at
the
very
hands
of
your
father
and
even
now
by
your
foolishness
she
is
journeying
to
certain
death
oh
my
son
we
have
not
seen
the
last
of
this
rash
conduct
this
noble
woman
blood
will
be
upon
our
hands
and
you
will
bring
your
poor
father
to
ruin
and
shame
up
stop
your
lovesick
idling
and
do
something
ask
his
majesty
with
my
consent
for
military
duty
go
to
the
seat
of
war
and
there
find
your
wife
or
your
honor
the
father
advice
was
just
what
was
needed
the
son
could
not
of
necessity
disobey
nor
did
he
wish
to
but
arming
himself
with
the
courage
of
a
desperate
resolve
to
save
his
sweetheart
whom
he
fancied
already
in
danger
from
the
rebels
he
hurried
to
seoul
and
surprising
his
sovereign
by
his
strange
and
ardent
desire
for
military
service
easily
secured
the
favor
for
the
general
in
command
was
the
same
who
had
wished
to
marry
his
son
to
uhn
hah
he
was
also
an
enemy
to
pang
noo
father
and
would
like
to
see
the
only
son
of
his
enemy
killed
with
apparently
strange
haste
the
expedition
was
started
off
and
no
time
was
lost
on
the
long
hard
march
arriving
near
the
seat
of
war
the
road
led
by
a
mountain
where
the
black
stone
was
as
bare
as
a
wall
sloping
down
to
the
road
fearing
lest
he
was
going
to
his
death
the
young
commander
had
some
characters
cut
high
on
the
face
of
the
rock
which
read
standing
at
the
gate
of
war
i
you
pang
noo
humbly
bow
to
decree
is
it
victory
or
is
it
death
heaven
alone
knows
the
issue
my
only
remaining
desire
is
to
behold
the
face
of
my
lady
cho
gah
he
put
this
inscription
in
this
conspicuous
place
with
the
hope
that
if
she
were
in
the
district
she
would
see
it
and
not
only
know
he
was
true
to
her
but
also
that
she
might
be
able
to
ascertain
his
whereabouts
and
come
to
him
he
met
the
rebels
and
fought
with
a
will
bringing
victory
to
the
royal
arms
but
soon
their
provisions
gave
out
and
though
daily
despatches
arrived
no
rations
were
sent
in
answer
to
their
constant
demands
the
soldiers
sickened
and
died
many
more
driven
mad
by
hardship
and
starvation
buried
their
troubles
deep
in
the
silent
river
which
their
loyal
spears
had
stained
crimson
with
their
enemies
blood
you
pang
noo
was
about
to
retire
against
orders
when
the
rebels
emboldened
by
the
weak
condition
of
their
adversaries
came
in
force
conquered
and
slew
the
remnant
and
would
have
slain
the
commander
but
for
the
counsel
of
two
of
their
number
who
urged
that
he
be
imprisoned
and
held
for
ransom
viii
again
fate
had
interfered
to
further
separate
the
lovers
for
instead
of
continuing
her
journey
uhn
hah
had
received
news
that
induced
her
to
start
for
seoul
while
resting
on
one
occasion
they
had
some
conversation
with
a
he
was
from
the
capital
and
stated
that
he
had
gone
there
from
a
place
near
uhn
hah
childhood
home
as
an
attendant
of
the
ussa
you
pang
noo
who
had
taken
sick
at
his
uncle
the
magistrate
and
had
gone
to
seoul
where
he
was
excused
from
ussa
duty
and
offered
service
at
court
he
knew
not
of
the
recent
changes
but
told
his
eager
listener
all
he
knew
of
pang
noo
family
the
weary
girl
and
her
companion
turned
their
faces
toward
the
capital
hoping
at
last
to
be
rewarded
by
finding
the
object
of
their
search
that
evening
darkness
overtook
them
before
they
had
found
shelter
and
spying
a
light
through
the
trees
they
sought
it
out
and
found
a
little
hut
occupied
by
an
old
man
he
was
reading
a
book
but
laid
it
aside
as
they
answered
his
invitation
to
enter
given
in
response
to
their
knock
the
usual
salutations
were
exchanged
but
instead
of
asking
who
the
visitors
were
where
they
lived
the
old
man
called
her
by
her
true
name
cho
nang
jah
i
am
not
a
nang
jah
a
female
appellation
she
exclaimed
i
am
a
man
oh
i
know
you
laughed
the
old
man
you
are
cho
nang
jah
in
very
truth
and
you
are
seeking
your
future
husband
in
this
disguise
but
you
are
perfectly
safe
here
ask
me
no
questions
said
he
as
she
was
about
to
utter
some
surprised
inquiries
i
have
been
waiting
for
you
and
expecting
you
you
are
soon
to
do
great
things
for
which
i
will
prepare
you
never
mind
your
hunger
but
devour
this
pill
it
will
give
you
superhuman
strength
and
courage
he
gave
her
a
pill
of
great
size
which
she
ate
and
then
fell
asleep
on
the
floor
the
old
man
went
away
and
soon
the
tired
servant
slept
also
when
they
awoke
it
was
bright
morning
and
the
birds
were
singing
in
the
trees
above
them
which
were
their
only
shelter
for
the
hut
of
the
previous
evening
had
disappeared
entirely
as
had
also
the
old
man
concluding
that
the
old
man
must
be
some
messenger
she
devoutly
bowed
herself
in
grateful
acknowledgment
of
the
gracious
manifestation
journeying
on
they
soon
came
to
a
wayside
inn
kept
by
an
old
farmer
and
here
they
procured
food
while
they
were
eating
a
blind
man
was
prophesying
for
the
people
when
he
came
to
uhn
hah
he
said
this
is
a
woman
in
disguise
she
is
seeking
for
her
husband
who
is
fighting
the
rebels
and
searching
for
her
he
is
now
nearly
dead
but
he
will
not
die
for
she
will
rescue
him
on
hearing
this
she
was
delighted
and
sad
at
the
same
time
and
explaining
some
of
her
history
to
the
master
of
the
house
he
took
her
in
with
the
women
and
treated
her
kindly
she
was
very
anxious
to
be
about
her
work
however
since
heaven
had
apparently
so
clearly
pointed
it
out
to
her
and
bidding
the
simple
but
kind
friends
she
started
for
the
seat
of
war
where
she
arrived
after
a
long
tedious
but
uneventful
tramp
almost
the
first
thing
she
saw
was
the
inscription
on
the
rocks
left
by
the
very
one
she
sought
and
she
cried
bitterly
at
the
thought
that
maybe
she
was
too
late
the
servant
cheered
her
up
however
by
reciting
the
blind
man
prophecy
and
they
went
on
their
way
till
they
came
to
a
miserable
little
inn
where
they
secured
lodging
after
being
there
some
time
uhn
hah
noticed
that
the
innkeeper
wife
was
very
sad
and
continually
in
tears
she
therefore
questioned
her
as
to
the
cause
of
her
grief
i
am
mourning
over
the
fate
of
the
poor
starved
soldiers
killed
by
the
neglect
of
some
one
at
seoul
and
for
the
brave
young
officer
you
pang
noo
whom
the
rebels
have
carried
away
captive
at
this
uhn
hah
fainted
away
and
the
nurse
made
such
explanation
as
she
could
restoratives
were
applied
and
she
slowly
recovered
when
on
further
questioning
it
was
found
that
the
were
slaves
of
you
pang
noo
and
had
followed
him
thus
far
it
was
also
learned
that
the
absence
of
stores
was
generally
believed
to
be
due
to
the
corrupt
who
not
only
hated
his
gallant
young
officer
but
was
unwilling
to
let
him
achieve
glory
so
long
as
he
could
prevent
it
after
consultation
and
learning
further
of
the
matter
uhn
hah
wrote
a
letter
explaining
the
condition
of
affairs
and
dispatched
it
to
pang
noo
father
by
the
innkeeper
the
governor
was
not
at
his
country
place
and
the
messenger
had
to
go
to
seoul
where
to
his
horror
he
found
that
his
old
master
was
in
prison
sent
there
by
the
influence
of
the
corrupt
general
his
enemy
because
his
son
had
been
accused
of
being
a
traitor
giving
over
the
royal
troops
to
the
rebels
and
escaping
with
them
himself
the
innkeeper
however
secured
access
to
the
prison
and
delivered
the
letter
to
the
unfortunate
parent
of
course
nothing
could
be
done
and
again
he
blamed
his
son
for
his
stupid
secrecy
in
concealing
his
troubles
from
his
father
and
thus
bringing
ruin
upon
the
family
and
injury
to
the
young
lady
however
he
wrote
a
letter
to
the
good
uncle
relating
the
facts
and
requesting
him
to
find
the
girl
place
her
in
his
home
and
care
for
her
as
tenderly
as
possible
he
could
do
nothing
more
the
innkeeper
delivered
this
letter
to
the
uncle
and
was
then
instructed
to
carry
a
litter
and
attendants
to
his
home
and
bring
back
the
young
lady
attired
in
suitable
garments
he
did
so
as
speedily
as
possible
though
the
journey
was
a
long
and
tedious
one
once
installed
in
a
comfortable
home
poor
uhn
hah
became
more
and
more
lonely
she
seemed
to
have
nothing
now
to
hope
for
and
the
stagnation
of
idleness
was
more
than
she
could
endure
she
fancied
her
lover
in
prison
and
suffering
while
she
was
in
the
midst
of
comfort
and
luxury
she
could
not
endure
the
thought
and
prevailed
upon
her
benefactor
to
convey
to
his
majesty
a
petition
praying
that
she
be
given
a
body
of
soldiers
and
be
allowed
to
go
and
punish
the
rebels
reclaim
the
territory
and
liberate
her
husband
the
king
marvelled
much
at
such
a
request
coming
from
one
of
her
retiring
seclusive
sex
and
upon
the
advice
of
the
wicked
general
who
was
still
in
command
the
petition
was
not
granted
still
she
persisted
and
found
other
ways
of
reaching
the
throne
till
the
king
out
of
curiosity
to
see
such
a
brave
and
loyal
woman
bade
her
come
before
him
when
she
entered
the
royal
presence
her
beauty
and
dignity
of
carriage
at
once
won
attention
and
respectful
admiration
so
that
her
request
was
about
to
be
granted
when
the
general
suggested
as
a
last
resort
that
she
first
give
some
evidence
of
her
strength
and
prowess
before
the
national
military
reputation
be
entrusted
to
her
keeping
it
seemed
a
wise
thought
and
the
king
asked
her
what
she
could
do
to
show
that
she
was
warranted
in
heading
such
a
perilous
expedition
she
breathed
a
prayer
to
her
departed
parents
for
help
and
remembering
the
strange
promise
of
the
old
man
who
gave
her
the
pill
she
felt
that
she
could
do
almost
any
thing
and
seizing
a
large
stone
that
stood
in
an
ornamental
rock
basin
in
the
court
she
threw
it
over
the
enclosing
wall
as
easily
as
two
men
would
have
lifted
it
from
the
ground
then
taking
the
general
sword
she
began
slowly
to
manipulate
it
increasing
gradually
as
though
in
keeping
with
hidden
music
till
the
movement
became
so
rapid
that
the
sword
seemed
like
one
continuous
ring
of
burning
steel
now
in
the
air
now
about
her
own
person
and
again
menacingly
near
the
wicked
general
who
cowered
in
abject
terror
before
the
remarkable
sight
his
majesty
was
completely
captivated
and
himself
gave
the
orders
for
her
expedition
raising
her
to
relative
rank
and
giving
her
the
choicest
battalion
of
troops
in
her
own
peculiarly
dignified
way
she
expressed
her
gratitude
and
bowing
to
the
ground
went
forth
to
execute
her
sovereign
commands
and
attain
her
heart
desire
again
donning
male
attire
she
completed
her
preparations
and
departed
with
eager
delight
to
accomplish
her
mission
the
troops
having
obtained
an
inkling
of
the
strange
character
and
almost
supernatural
power
of
their
handsome
dashing
leader
were
filled
with
courage
and
eager
for
the
fray
but
to
the
dismay
of
all
they
had
no
sooner
arrived
at
the
rebel
infested
country
than
severe
rains
began
to
fall
making
it
impossible
to
accomplish
any
thing
this
was
explained
however
by
the
spirits
of
the
departed
soldiers
who
appeared
to
the
officers
in
dreams
and
announced
that
as
they
had
been
sacrificed
by
the
cruel
general
who
had
intentionally
withheld
their
rations
they
would
allow
no
success
to
the
royal
arms
till
their
death
was
avenged
by
his
death
this
was
dispatched
to
court
and
believed
by
his
majesty
who
had
heard
similar
reports
oft
repeated
he
therefore
confined
the
general
in
prison
and
sent
his
son
the
one
who
wished
to
marry
uhn
hah
to
the
front
to
be
executed
he
was
slain
and
his
blood
scattered
to
the
winds
a
feast
was
prepared
for
the
spirits
of
the
departed
soldiers
and
this
sacrifice
having
been
made
the
storm
ceased
the
sun
shone
and
the
royal
troops
met
and
completely
vanquished
the
rebels
restoring
peace
to
the
troubled
districts
but
not
obtaining
the
real
object
of
the
search
after
much
questioning
among
the
captives
a
man
was
found
who
knew
all
about
you
pang
noo
and
where
he
was
secreted
upon
the
promise
of
pardon
he
conducted
a
party
who
rescued
the
captive
and
brought
him
before
their
commander
of
course
for
a
time
the
lovers
could
not
recognize
each
other
after
the
years
that
had
elapsed
since
their
first
chance
meeting
you
pang
noo
was
given
command
and
uhn
hah
modestly
retired
adopted
her
proper
dress
and
was
borne
back
to
seoul
in
a
litter
the
whole
country
rang
with
their
praises
you
pang
noo
was
appointed
governor
of
a
province
and
the
father
was
reinstated
in
office
while
the
general
who
had
caused
the
trouble
was
ignominiously
put
to
death
and
his
whole
family
and
his
estates
were
confiscated
as
cho
uhn
hah
had
no
parents
his
majesty
determined
that
she
should
have
royal
patronage
and
decreed
that
their
wedding
should
take
place
in
the
great
hall
where
the
members
of
the
royal
family
are
united
in
marriage
this
was
done
with
all
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
a
royal
wedding
and
no
official
stood
so
high
in
the
estimation
of
the
king
as
the
valiant
you
while
the
virtues
of
his
spouse
were
the
subject
of
songs
and
ballads
and
she
was
extolled
as
the
model
for
the
women
of
the
country
hyung
bo
and
nahl
bo
or
the
rewards
i
in
the
province
of
chullado
in
southern
korea
lived
two
brothers
one
was
very
rich
the
other
very
poor
for
in
dividing
the
inheritance
the
elder
brother
instead
of
taking
the
father
place
and
providing
for
the
younger
children
kept
the
whole
property
to
himself
allowing
his
younger
brother
nothing
at
all
and
reducing
him
to
a
condition
of
abject
misery
both
men
were
married
nahl
bo
the
elder
had
many
concubines
in
addition
to
his
wife
but
had
no
children
while
hyung
bo
had
but
one
wife
and
several
children
the
former
wives
were
continually
quarrelling
the
latter
lived
in
contentment
and
peace
with
his
wife
each
endeavoring
to
help
the
other
bear
the
heavy
burdens
circumstances
had
placed
upon
them
the
elder
brother
lived
in
a
fine
large
compound
with
warm
comfortable
houses
the
younger
had
built
himself
a
hut
of
broom
straw
the
thatch
of
which
was
so
poor
that
when
it
rained
they
were
deluged
inside
upon
the
earthern
floor
the
room
was
so
small
too
that
when
hyung
bo
stretched
out
his
legs
in
his
sleep
his
feet
were
apt
to
be
thrust
through
the
wall
they
had
no
kang
and
had
to
sleep
upon
the
cold
dirt
floor
where
insects
were
so
abundant
as
to
often
succeed
in
driving
the
sleepers
out
of
doors
they
had
no
money
for
the
comforts
of
life
and
were
glad
when
a
stroke
of
good
fortune
enabled
them
to
obtain
the
necessities
hyung
bo
worked
whenever
he
could
get
work
but
rainy
days
and
dull
seasons
were
a
heavy
strain
upon
them
the
wife
did
plain
sewing
and
together
they
made
straw
sandals
for
the
peasants
and
vendors
at
fair
time
the
sandal
business
was
good
but
then
came
a
time
when
no
more
food
was
left
in
the
house
the
string
for
making
the
sandals
was
all
used
up
and
they
had
no
money
for
a
new
supply
then
the
children
cried
to
their
mother
for
food
till
her
heart
ached
for
them
and
the
father
wandered
off
in
a
last
attempt
to
get
something
to
keep
the
breath
of
life
in
his
family
not
a
kernel
of
rice
was
left
a
poor
rat
which
had
cast
in
his
lot
with
this
kind
family
became
desperate
when
night
after
night
he
chased
around
the
little
house
without
being
able
to
find
the
semblance
of
a
meal
becoming
desperate
he
vented
his
despair
in
such
loud
squealing
that
he
wakened
the
neighbors
who
declared
that
the
mouse
said
his
legs
were
worn
off
running
about
in
a
vain
search
for
a
grain
of
rice
with
which
to
appease
his
hunger
the
famine
became
so
serious
in
the
little
home
that
at
last
the
mother
commanded
her
son
to
go
to
his
uncle
and
tell
him
plainly
how
distressed
they
were
and
ask
him
to
loan
them
enough
rice
to
subsist
on
till
they
could
get
work
when
they
would
surely
return
the
loan
the
boy
did
not
want
to
go
his
uncle
would
never
recognize
him
on
the
street
and
he
was
afraid
to
go
inside
his
house
lest
he
should
whip
him
but
the
mother
commanded
him
to
go
and
he
obeyed
outside
his
uncle
house
were
many
cows
well
fed
and
valuable
in
pens
he
saw
great
fat
pigs
in
abundance
and
fowls
were
everywhere
in
great
numbers
many
dogs
also
were
there
and
they
ran
barking
at
him
tearing
his
clothes
with
their
teeth
and
frightening
him
so
much
that
he
was
tempted
to
run
but
speaking
kindly
to
them
they
quieted
down
and
one
dog
came
and
licked
his
hand
as
if
ashamed
of
the
conduct
of
the
others
a
female
servant
ordered
him
away
but
he
told
her
he
was
her
master
nephew
and
wanted
to
see
him
whereupon
she
smiled
but
let
him
pass
into
an
inner
court
where
he
found
his
uncle
sitting
on
the
little
veranda
under
the
broad
overhanging
eaves
the
man
gruffly
demanded
who
are
you
i
am
your
brother
son
he
said
we
are
starving
at
our
house
and
have
had
no
food
for
three
days
my
father
is
away
now
trying
to
find
work
but
we
are
very
hungry
and
only
ask
you
to
loan
us
a
little
rice
till
we
can
get
some
to
return
you
the
uncle
eyes
drew
down
to
a
point
his
brows
contracted
and
he
seemed
very
angry
so
that
the
nephew
began
looking
for
an
easy
way
of
escape
in
case
he
should
come
at
him
at
last
he
looked
up
and
said
my
rice
is
locked
up
and
i
have
ordered
the
granaries
not
to
be
opened
the
flour
is
sealed
and
can
not
be
broken
into
if
i
give
you
some
cold
victuals
the
dogs
will
bark
at
you
and
try
to
take
it
from
you
if
i
give
you
the
leavings
of
the
the
pigs
will
be
jealous
and
squeal
at
you
if
i
give
you
bran
the
cows
and
fowls
will
take
after
you
get
out
and
let
me
never
see
you
here
again
so
saying
he
caught
the
poor
boy
by
the
collar
and
threw
him
into
the
outer
court
hurting
him
and
causing
him
to
cry
bitterly
with
pain
of
body
and
distress
of
mind
at
home
the
poor
mother
sat
jogging
her
babe
in
her
weak
arms
and
appeasing
the
other
children
by
saying
that
brother
had
gone
to
their
uncle
for
food
and
soon
the
pot
would
be
boiling
and
they
would
all
be
satisfied
when
hearing
a
all
scrambled
eagerly
to
the
door
only
to
see
the
boy
coming
along
trying
manfully
to
look
cheerful
did
your
uncle
whip
you
asked
the
mother
more
eager
for
the
safety
of
her
son
than
to
have
her
own
crying
want
allayed
no
stammered
the
brave
boy
he
had
gone
to
the
capital
on
business
said
he
hoping
to
thus
prevent
further
questioning
on
so
troublesome
a
subject
what
shall
i
do
queried
the
poor
woman
amidst
the
crying
and
moaning
of
her
children
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
starve
it
seemed
however
she
thought
of
her
own
straw
shoes
which
were
scarcely
used
and
these
she
sent
to
the
market
where
they
brought
three
cash
of
a
cent
this
pittance
was
invested
equally
in
rice
beans
and
vegetables
eating
which
they
were
relieved
for
the
present
and
with
full
stomachs
the
little
ones
fell
to
playing
happily
once
more
but
the
poor
mother
was
full
of
anxiety
for
the
morrow
their
fortune
had
turned
however
with
their
new
lease
of
life
for
the
father
returned
with
a
bale
of
faggots
he
had
gathered
on
the
mountains
and
with
the
proceeds
of
these
the
shoes
were
redeemed
and
more
food
was
purchased
bright
and
early
then
next
morning
both
parents
went
forth
in
search
of
work
the
wife
secured
employment
winnowing
rice
the
husband
overtook
a
boy
bearing
a
pack
but
his
back
was
so
blistered
he
could
with
difficulty
carry
his
burden
hyung
bo
adjusted
the
saddle
of
the
pack
frame
to
his
own
back
and
carried
it
for
the
boy
who
at
their
arrival
at
his
destination
in
the
evening
gave
his
helper
some
cash
in
addition
to
his
lodging
and
meals
during
the
night
however
a
gentleman
wished
to
send
a
letter
by
rapid
dispatch
to
a
distant
place
and
hyung
bo
was
paid
well
for
carrying
it
returning
from
this
profitable
errand
he
heard
of
a
very
rich
man
who
had
been
seized
by
the
corrupt
local
magistrate
on
a
false
accusation
and
was
to
be
beaten
publicly
unless
he
consented
to
pay
a
heavy
sum
as
hush
money
hearing
of
this
hyung
went
to
see
the
rich
prisoner
and
arranged
with
him
that
he
would
act
as
his
substitute
for
three
thousand
cash
two
dollars
the
man
was
very
glad
to
get
off
so
easily
and
hyung
took
the
beating
he
limped
to
his
house
where
his
poor
wife
greeted
him
with
tears
and
lamentations
for
he
was
a
sore
and
sorry
sight
indeed
he
was
cheerful
however
for
he
explained
to
them
that
this
had
been
a
rich
day
work
he
had
simply
submitted
to
a
little
whipping
and
was
to
get
three
thousand
cash
for
it
the
money
did
not
come
however
for
the
fraud
was
detected
and
the
original
prisoner
was
also
punished
being
of
rather
a
close
disposition
the
man
seemed
to
think
it
unnecessary
to
pay
for
what
did
him
no
good
then
the
wife
cried
indeed
over
her
husband
wrongs
and
their
own
more
unfortunate
condition
but
the
husband
cheered
her
saying
if
we
do
right
we
will
surely
succeed
he
was
right
spring
was
coming
on
and
he
soon
got
work
at
plowing
and
sowing
seed
they
gave
their
little
house
the
usual
spring
cleaning
and
decorated
the
door
with
appropriate
legends
calling
upon
the
fates
to
bless
with
prosperity
the
little
home
with
the
spring
came
the
birds
from
the
south
country
and
they
seemed
to
have
a
preference
for
the
home
of
this
poor
family
as
indeed
did
the
rats
and
insects
the
birds
built
their
nests
under
the
eaves
they
were
swallows
and
as
they
made
their
little
mud
hyung
bo
said
to
his
wife
i
am
afraid
to
have
these
birds
build
their
nests
there
our
house
is
so
weak
it
may
fall
down
and
then
what
will
the
poor
birds
do
but
the
little
visitors
seemed
not
alarmed
and
remained
with
the
kind
people
apparently
feeling
safe
under
the
friendly
roof
by
and
by
the
little
nests
were
full
of
commotion
and
bluster
the
eggs
had
opened
and
circles
of
wide
opened
mouths
could
be
seen
in
every
nest
hyung
and
his
children
were
greatly
interested
in
this
new
addition
to
their
family
circle
and
often
gave
them
bits
of
their
own
scanty
allowance
of
food
so
that
the
birds
became
quite
tame
and
hopped
in
and
out
of
the
hut
at
will
one
day
when
the
little
birds
were
taking
their
first
lesson
in
flying
hyung
was
lying
on
his
back
on
the
ground
and
saw
a
huge
crawl
along
and
devour
several
little
birds
before
he
could
arise
and
help
them
one
bird
struggled
from
the
reptile
and
fell
but
catching
both
legs
in
the
fine
meshes
of
a
they
were
broken
and
the
little
fellow
hung
helplessly
within
the
snake
reach
hyung
hastily
snatched
it
down
and
with
the
help
of
his
wife
he
bound
up
the
broken
limbs
using
dried
for
splints
he
laid
the
little
patient
in
a
warm
place
and
the
bones
speedily
united
so
that
the
bird
soon
began
to
hop
around
the
room
and
pick
up
bits
of
food
laid
out
for
him
soon
the
splints
were
removed
however
and
he
flew
away
happily
to
join
his
fellows
the
autumn
came
and
one
evening
it
was
the
ninth
day
of
the
ninth
moon
as
the
little
family
were
sitting
about
the
door
they
noticed
the
bird
with
the
crooked
legs
sitting
on
the
and
singing
to
them
i
believe
he
is
thanking
us
and
saying
said
hyung
for
the
birds
are
all
going
south
now
that
seemed
to
be
the
truth
for
they
saw
their
little
friend
no
longer
and
they
felt
lonely
without
the
occupants
of
the
now
deserted
nests
the
birds
however
were
paying
homage
to
the
king
of
birds
in
the
beyond
the
frosts
and
as
the
king
saw
the
little
bird
come
along
he
demanded
an
explanation
of
the
strange
sight
thereupon
the
little
fellow
related
his
narrow
escape
from
a
snake
that
had
already
devoured
many
of
his
brothers
and
cousins
the
accident
in
the
blind
and
his
rescue
and
subsequent
treatment
by
a
very
poor
but
very
kind
man
his
bird
majesty
was
very
much
entertained
and
pleased
he
thereupon
gave
the
little
cripple
a
seed
engraved
with
fine
characters
in
gold
denoting
that
the
seed
belonged
to
the
gourd
family
this
seed
the
bird
was
to
give
to
his
benefactor
in
the
spring
the
winter
wore
away
and
the
spring
found
the
little
family
almost
as
destitute
as
when
first
we
described
them
one
day
they
heard
a
familiar
bird
song
and
running
out
they
saw
their
little
friend
with
something
in
its
mouth
that
looked
like
a
seed
dropping
its
burden
to
the
ground
the
little
bird
sang
to
them
of
the
king
gratitude
and
of
the
present
he
had
sent
and
then
flew
away
hyung
picked
up
the
seed
with
curiosity
and
on
one
side
he
saw
the
name
of
its
kind
on
the
other
in
fine
gold
characters
was
a
message
saying
bury
me
in
soft
earth
and
give
me
plenty
of
water
they
did
so
and
in
four
days
the
little
shoot
appeared
in
the
fine
earth
they
watched
its
remarkable
growth
with
eager
interest
as
the
stem
shot
up
and
climbed
all
over
the
house
covering
it
up
as
a
bower
and
threatening
to
break
down
the
frail
structure
with
the
added
weight
it
blossomed
and
soon
four
small
gourds
began
to
form
they
grew
to
an
enormous
size
and
hyung
could
scarcely
keep
from
cutting
them
his
wife
prevailed
on
him
to
wait
till
the
frost
had
made
them
ripe
however
as
then
they
could
cut
them
eat
the
inside
and
make
of
the
shells
which
they
could
then
sell
and
thus
make
a
double
profit
he
waited
though
with
a
poor
grace
till
the
ninth
moon
when
the
gourds
were
left
alone
high
upon
the
roof
with
only
a
trace
of
the
shrivelled
stems
which
had
planted
them
there
hyung
got
a
saw
and
sawed
open
the
first
huge
gourd
he
worked
so
long
that
when
his
task
was
finished
he
feared
he
must
be
in
a
swoon
for
out
of
the
opened
gourd
stepped
two
beautiful
boys
with
fine
bottles
of
wine
and
a
table
of
jade
set
with
dainty
cups
hyung
staggered
back
and
sought
assurance
of
his
wife
who
was
fully
as
dazed
as
was
her
husband
the
surprise
was
somewhat
relieved
by
one
of
the
handsome
youths
stepping
forth
placing
the
table
before
them
and
announcing
that
the
bird
king
had
sent
them
with
these
presents
to
the
benefactor
of
one
of
his
subjects
the
bird
with
broken
legs
ere
they
could
answer
the
other
youth
placed
a
silver
bottle
on
the
table
saying
this
wine
will
restore
life
to
the
dead
another
which
he
placed
on
the
table
would
he
said
restore
sight
to
the
blind
then
going
to
the
gourd
he
brought
two
gold
bottles
one
contained
a
tobacco
which
being
smoked
would
give
speech
to
the
dumb
while
the
other
gold
bottle
contained
wine
which
would
prevent
the
approach
of
age
and
ward
off
death
having
made
these
announcements
the
pair
disappeared
leaving
hyung
and
his
wife
almost
dumb
with
amazement
they
looked
at
the
gourd
then
at
the
little
table
and
its
contents
and
each
looked
at
the
other
to
be
sure
it
was
not
a
dream
at
length
hyung
broke
the
silence
remarking
that
as
he
was
very
hungry
he
would
venture
to
open
another
gourd
in
the
hope
that
it
would
be
found
full
of
something
good
to
eat
since
it
was
not
so
important
for
him
to
have
something
with
which
to
restore
life
just
now
as
it
was
to
have
something
to
sustain
life
with
the
next
gourd
was
opened
as
was
the
first
when
by
some
means
out
flowed
all
manner
of
household
furniture
and
clothing
with
rolls
upon
rolls
of
fine
silk
and
satin
cloth
linen
goods
and
the
finest
cotton
the
satin
alone
was
far
greater
in
bulk
than
the
gourd
had
been
yet
in
addition
the
premises
were
literally
strewn
with
costly
furniture
and
the
finest
fabrics
they
barely
examined
the
goods
now
their
amazement
having
become
so
great
that
they
could
scarcely
wait
until
all
had
been
opened
and
the
whole
seemed
so
unreal
that
they
feared
delay
might
be
dangerous
both
sawed
away
on
the
next
gourd
when
out
came
a
body
of
carpenters
all
equipped
with
tools
and
lumber
and
to
their
utter
and
complete
amazement
began
putting
up
a
house
as
quickly
and
quietly
as
thought
so
that
before
they
could
arise
from
the
ground
they
saw
a
fine
house
standing
before
them
with
courts
and
servants
quarters
stables
and
granaries
simultaneously
a
great
train
of
bulls
and
ponies
appeared
loaded
down
with
rice
and
other
products
as
tributes
from
the
district
in
which
the
place
was
located
others
came
bringing
money
tribute
servants
male
and
female
and
clothing
they
felt
sure
they
were
in
dreamland
now
and
that
they
might
enjoy
the
exercise
of
power
while
it
lasted
they
began
commanding
the
servants
to
put
the
goods
away
the
money
in
the
sahrang
or
the
clothing
in
the
tarack
or
garret
over
the
fireplace
the
rice
in
the
granaries
and
animals
in
their
stables
others
were
sent
to
prepare
a
bath
that
they
might
don
the
fine
clothing
before
it
should
be
too
late
the
servants
obeyed
increasing
the
astonishment
of
the
pair
and
causing
them
to
literally
forget
the
fourth
gourd
in
their
amazed
contemplation
of
the
wondrous
miracles
being
performed
and
the
dreamy
air
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
with
which
it
surrounded
them
their
attention
was
called
to
the
gourd
by
the
servants
who
were
then
commanded
to
carefully
saw
it
open
they
did
so
and
out
stepped
a
maiden
as
beautiful
as
were
the
gifts
that
had
preceded
her
never
before
had
hyung
looked
on
any
one
who
could
at
all
compare
with
the
matchless
beauty
and
grace
of
the
lovely
creature
who
now
stood
so
modestly
and
confidingly
before
him
he
could
find
no
words
to
express
his
boundless
admiration
and
could
only
stand
in
mute
wonder
and
feast
himself
upon
her
beauty
not
so
with
his
wife
however
she
saw
only
a
rival
in
the
beautiful
girl
and
straightway
demanded
who
she
was
whence
she
came
and
what
she
wanted
the
maid
replied
i
am
sent
by
the
bird
king
to
be
this
man
concubine
whereupon
the
wife
grew
dark
in
the
face
and
ordered
her
to
go
whence
she
came
and
not
see
her
husband
again
she
upbraided
him
for
not
being
content
with
a
house
and
estate
numbers
of
retainers
and
quantities
of
money
and
declared
this
last
trouble
was
all
due
to
his
greed
in
opening
the
fourth
gourd
her
husband
had
by
this
time
found
his
speech
however
and
severely
reprimanding
her
for
conducting
herself
in
such
a
manner
upon
the
receipt
of
such
heavenly
gifts
while
yesterday
she
had
been
little
more
than
a
beggar
he
commanded
her
to
go
at
once
to
the
quarters
where
she
should
reign
supreme
and
never
make
such
a
display
of
her
again
under
penalty
of
being
consigned
to
a
house
by
herself
the
maiden
he
gladly
welcomed
and
conducted
her
to
apartments
set
aside
for
her
ii
when
nahl
bo
heard
of
the
wonderful
change
taking
place
at
his
brother
establishment
he
went
himself
to
look
into
the
matter
he
found
the
report
not
exaggerated
and
began
to
upbraid
his
brother
with
dishonest
methods
which
accusation
the
brother
stoutly
denied
and
further
demanded
where
and
of
whom
he
could
steal
a
house
such
rich
garments
fine
furniture
and
have
it
removed
in
a
day
to
the
site
of
his
former
hovel
nahl
bo
demanded
an
explanation
and
hyung
bo
frankly
told
him
how
he
had
saved
the
bird
from
the
snake
and
had
bound
up
its
broken
limbs
so
that
it
recovered
how
the
bird
in
return
brought
him
a
seed
engraved
with
gold
characters
instructing
him
how
to
plant
and
rear
it
and
how
having
done
so
the
four
gourds
were
born
on
the
stalk
and
from
them
on
ripening
had
appeared
these
rich
gifts
the
brother
even
then
persisted
in
his
charges
and
in
a
gruff
ugly
manner
accused
hyung
bo
of
being
worse
than
a
thief
in
keeping
all
these
fine
goods
instead
of
dutifully
sharing
them
with
his
elder
brother
this
insinuation
of
undutiful
conduct
really
annoyed
hyung
bo
who
in
his
kindness
of
heart
forgave
this
unbrotherly
senior
his
former
ill
conduct
and
thinking
only
of
his
own
present
good
fortune
he
kindly
bestowed
considerable
gifts
upon
the
undeserving
brother
and
doubtless
would
have
done
more
but
that
the
covetous
man
espyed
the
fair
maiden
and
at
once
insisted
on
having
her
this
was
too
much
even
for
the
patient
hyung
bo
who
refused
with
a
determination
remarkable
for
him
a
quarrel
ensued
during
which
the
elder
brother
took
his
departure
in
a
rage
fully
determined
to
use
the
secret
of
his
brother
success
for
all
it
was
worth
in
securing
rich
gifts
for
himself
going
home
he
struck
at
all
the
birds
he
could
see
and
ordered
his
servants
to
do
the
same
after
killing
many
he
succeeded
in
catching
one
and
breaking
its
legs
he
took
and
bound
them
up
in
splints
laying
the
little
sufferer
in
a
warm
place
till
it
recovered
and
flew
away
bandages
and
all
the
result
was
as
expected
the
bird
being
questioned
by
the
bird
king
concerning
its
crooked
legs
related
its
story
dwelling
however
on
the
man
cruelty
in
killing
so
many
birds
and
then
breaking
its
own
legs
the
king
understood
thoroughly
and
gave
the
little
cripple
a
seed
to
present
to
the
wicked
man
on
its
return
in
the
spring
springtime
came
and
one
day
as
nahl
bo
was
sitting
in
the
little
room
opening
on
the
veranda
off
his
court
he
heard
a
familiar
dropping
his
long
pipe
he
threw
open
the
paper
windows
and
there
sure
enough
sat
a
bird
on
the
clothes
line
bearing
a
seed
in
its
mouth
nahl
bo
would
let
no
one
touch
it
but
as
the
bird
dropped
the
seed
and
flew
away
he
jumped
out
so
eagerly
that
he
forgot
to
slip
his
shoes
on
and
got
his
clean
white
stockings
all
befouled
he
secured
the
seed
however
and
felt
that
his
fortune
was
made
he
planted
it
carefully
as
directed
and
gave
it
his
personal
attention
the
vines
were
most
luxurious
they
grew
with
great
rapidity
till
they
had
well
nigh
covered
the
whole
of
his
large
house
and
instead
of
one
gourd
or
even
four
as
in
the
brother
case
the
new
vines
bore
twelve
gourds
which
grew
and
grew
till
the
great
beams
of
his
house
fairly
groaned
under
their
weight
and
he
had
to
block
them
in
place
to
keep
them
from
rolling
off
the
roofs
he
had
to
hire
men
to
guard
them
carefully
for
now
that
the
source
of
hyung
bo
riches
was
understood
every
one
was
anxious
for
a
gourd
they
did
not
know
the
secret
however
which
nahl
bo
concealed
through
selfishness
and
hyung
through
fear
that
every
one
would
take
to
killing
and
maiming
birds
as
his
wicked
brother
had
done
maintaining
a
guard
was
expensive
and
the
plant
so
loosened
the
roof
tiles
by
the
tendrils
searching
for
earth
and
moisture
in
the
great
layer
of
clay
under
the
tiles
that
the
rainy
season
made
great
havoc
with
his
house
large
portions
of
plaster
from
the
inside
fell
upon
the
paper
ceilings
which
in
turn
gave
way
letting
the
dirty
water
drip
into
the
rooms
and
making
the
house
almost
uninhabitable
at
last
however
the
plants
could
do
no
more
harm
the
frost
had
come
the
vines
had
shrivelled
away
and
the
enormous
ripe
gourds
were
carefully
lowered
amid
the
yelling
of
a
score
of
coolies
as
each
seemed
to
get
in
the
others
way
trying
to
manipulate
the
ropes
and
poles
with
which
the
gourds
were
let
down
to
the
ground
once
inside
the
court
and
the
great
doors
locked
nahl
bo
felt
relieved
and
shutting
out
every
one
but
a
carpenter
and
his
assistant
he
prepared
for
the
great
surprise
which
he
knew
must
await
him
in
spite
of
his
most
vivid
dreams
the
carpenter
insisted
upon
the
enormous
sum
of
cash
for
opening
each
gourd
and
as
he
was
too
impatient
to
await
the
arrival
of
another
and
as
he
expected
to
be
of
princely
wealth
in
a
few
moments
nahl
bo
agreed
to
the
exorbitant
price
whereupon
carefully
bracing
a
gourd
the
men
began
sawing
it
through
it
seemed
a
long
time
before
the
gourd
fell
in
halves
when
it
did
out
came
a
party
of
such
as
perform
at
fairs
and
public
places
nahl
bo
was
unprepared
for
any
such
surprise
as
this
and
fancied
it
must
be
some
great
mistake
they
sang
and
danced
about
as
well
as
the
crowded
condition
of
the
court
would
allow
and
the
family
looked
on
complacently
supposing
that
the
band
had
been
sent
to
celebrate
their
coming
good
fortune
but
nahl
bo
soon
had
enough
of
this
he
wanted
to
get
at
his
riches
and
seeing
that
the
actors
were
about
to
stretch
their
ropes
for
a
more
extensive
performance
he
ordered
them
to
cease
and
take
their
departure
to
his
amazement
however
they
refused
to
do
this
until
he
had
paid
them
cash
for
their
trouble
you
sent
for
us
and
we
came
said
the
leader
now
pay
us
or
we
will
live
with
you
till
you
do
there
was
no
help
for
it
and
with
great
reluctance
and
some
foreboding
he
gave
them
the
money
and
dismissed
them
then
nahl
bo
turned
to
the
carpenter
who
chanced
to
be
a
man
with
an
ugly
visage
made
uglier
by
a
great
you
he
said
are
the
cause
of
all
this
before
you
entered
this
court
these
gourds
were
filled
with
gold
and
your
ugly
face
has
changed
it
to
beggars
number
two
was
opened
with
no
better
results
for
out
came
a
body
of
buddhist
priests
begging
for
their
temple
and
promising
many
sons
in
return
for
offerings
of
suitable
merit
although
disgusted
beyond
measure
nahl
bo
still
had
faith
in
the
gourds
and
to
get
rid
of
the
priests
lest
they
should
see
his
riches
he
gave
them
also
cash
as
soon
as
the
priests
were
gone
gourd
number
three
was
opened
with
still
poorer
results
for
out
came
a
procession
of
paid
mourners
followed
by
a
corpse
borne
by
bearers
the
mourners
wept
as
loudly
as
possible
and
all
was
in
a
perfect
uproar
when
ordered
to
go
the
mourners
declared
they
must
have
money
for
mourning
and
to
pay
for
burying
the
body
seeing
no
possible
help
for
it
cash
was
finally
given
them
and
they
went
out
with
the
bier
then
nahl
wife
came
into
the
court
and
began
to
abuse
the
man
for
bringing
upon
them
all
this
trouble
whereupon
the
latter
became
angry
and
demanded
his
money
that
he
might
leave
they
had
no
intention
of
giving
up
the
search
as
yet
however
and
as
it
was
too
late
to
change
carpenters
the
ugly
fellow
was
paid
for
the
work
already
done
and
given
an
advance
on
that
yet
remaining
he
therefore
set
to
work
upon
the
fourth
gourd
which
nahl
bo
watched
with
feverish
anxiety
from
this
one
there
came
a
band
of
gee
sang
or
dancing
girls
there
was
one
woman
from
each
province
and
each
had
her
song
and
dance
one
sang
of
the
yang
wang
or
wind
god
another
of
the
wang
jay
or
pan
deity
one
sang
of
the
sung
jee
or
money
that
is
placed
as
a
christening
on
the
roof
tree
of
every
house
there
was
the
cuckoo
song
the
song
of
the
ancient
tree
that
has
lived
so
long
that
its
heart
is
dead
and
gone
leaving
but
a
hollow
space
yet
the
leaves
spring
forth
every
the
song
of
laughter
and
mourning
with
an
injunction
to
see
to
it
that
the
rice
offering
be
made
to
the
departed
spirits
to
the
king
of
the
sun
and
stars
a
song
was
sung
and
last
of
all
one
votary
sang
of
the
twelve
months
that
make
the
year
the
twelve
hours
that
make
the
day
the
thirty
days
that
make
the
month
and
of
the
new
year
birth
as
the
old
year
dies
taking
with
it
their
ills
to
be
buried
in
the
past
and
reminding
all
people
to
celebrate
the
new
year
holidays
by
donning
clean
clothes
and
feasting
on
good
food
that
the
following
year
may
be
to
them
one
of
plenty
and
prosperity
having
finished
their
songs
and
their
graceful
posturing
and
waving
of
their
gay
silk
banners
the
gee
sang
demanded
their
pay
which
had
to
be
given
them
reducing
the
family
wealth
cash
more
the
wife
now
tried
to
persuade
nahl
bo
to
stop
and
not
open
more
but
the
man
offered
to
open
the
next
for
cash
as
he
was
secretly
enjoying
the
sport
so
the
fifth
was
opened
a
little
when
a
substance
was
seen
inside
which
was
taken
to
be
gold
and
they
hurriedly
opened
it
completely
but
instead
of
gold
out
came
an
acrobatic
pair
being
a
strong
man
with
a
youth
dressed
to
represent
a
girl
the
man
danced
about
holding
his
young
companion
balanced
upon
his
shoulders
singing
meanwhile
a
song
of
an
ancient
king
whose
riotous
living
was
so
distasteful
to
his
subjects
that
he
built
him
a
cavernous
palace
the
floor
of
which
was
covered
with
quicksilver
the
walls
were
decorated
with
jewels
and
myriad
lamps
turned
the
darkness
into
day
here
were
to
be
found
the
choicest
viands
and
wines
with
bands
of
music
to
entertain
the
feasters
most
beautiful
women
and
he
enjoyed
himself
most
luxuriously
until
his
enemy
learning
the
secret
threw
open
the
cavern
to
the
light
of
day
when
all
of
the
beautiful
women
immediately
disappeared
in
the
sun
rays
before
he
could
get
these
people
to
discontinue
their
performance
nahl
bo
had
to
give
them
also
cash
yet
in
spite
of
all
his
ill
luck
he
decided
to
open
another
which
being
done
a
jester
came
forth
demanding
the
expense
money
for
his
long
journey
this
was
finally
given
him
for
nahl
bo
had
hit
upon
what
he
deemed
a
clever
expedient
he
took
the
wise
fool
aside
and
asked
him
to
use
his
wisdom
in
pointing
out
to
him
which
of
these
gourds
contained
gold
whereupon
the
jester
looked
wise
tapped
several
gourds
and
motioned
to
each
one
as
being
filled
with
gold
the
seventh
was
therefore
opened
and
a
lot
of
yamen
runners
came
forth
followed
by
an
official
nahl
bo
tried
to
run
from
what
he
knew
must
mean
an
exorbitant
squeeze
but
he
was
caught
and
beaten
for
his
indiscretion
the
official
called
for
his
valise
and
took
from
it
a
paper
which
his
secretary
read
announcing
that
nahl
bo
was
the
serf
of
this
lord
and
must
hereafter
pay
to
him
a
heavy
tribute
at
this
they
groaned
in
their
hearts
and
the
wife
declared
that
even
now
the
money
was
all
gone
even
to
the
last
cash
while
the
rabble
which
had
collected
had
stolen
nearly
every
thing
worth
removing
yet
the
officer
servants
demanded
pay
for
their
services
and
they
had
to
be
given
a
note
secured
on
the
property
before
they
would
leave
matters
were
now
so
serious
that
they
could
not
be
made
much
worse
and
it
was
decided
to
open
each
remaining
gourd
that
if
there
were
any
gold
they
might
have
it
when
the
next
one
was
opened
a
bevy
of
moo
tang
women
soothsayers
came
forth
offering
to
drive
away
the
spirit
of
disease
and
restore
the
sick
to

they
arranged
their
banners
for
their
usual
dancing
ceremony
brought
forth
their
drums
with
which
to
exorcise
the
demons
and
called
for
rice
to
offer
to
the

nahl
bo
i
am
not
sick
except
for
the
visitation
of
such
as
yourselves
who
are
forever
burdening
the
poor
and
demanding
pay
for
your
supposed
services
away
with
you

if
you

they
were
no
easier
to
drive
away
however
than
were
the
other
annoying
visitors
that
had
come
with
his
supposed
good
fortune
he
had
finally
to
pay
them
as
he
had
the
others
and
dejectedly
he
sat
scarcely
noticing
the
opening
of
the
ninth
gourd
the
latter
proved
to
contain
a
juggler
and
the
exasperated
nahl
bo
seeing
but
one
small
man
determined
to
make
short
work
of
him
seizing
him
by
his
topknot
of
hair
he
was
about
to
drag
him
to
the
door
when
the
dexterous
fellow
catching
his
tormentor
by
the
thighs
threw
him
headlong
over
his
own
back
nearly
breaking
his
neck
and
causing
him
to
lie
stunned
for
a
time
while
the
expert
bound
him
hand
and
foot
and
stood
him
on
his
head
so
that
the
wife
was
glad
to
pay
the
fellow
and
dismiss
him
ere
the
life
should
be
departed
from
her
lord
on
opening
the
tenth
a
party
of
blind
men
came
out
picking
their
way
with
their
long
sticks
while
their
sightless
orbs
were
raised
towards
the
unseen
heavens
they
offered
to
tell
the
fortunes
of
the
family
but
while
their
services
might
have
been
demanded
earlier
the
case
was
now
too
desperate
for
any
such
help
the
old
men
tinkled
their
little
bells
and
chanted
some
poetry
addressed
to
the
four
good
spirits
stationed
at
the
four
corners
of
the
earth
where
they
patiently
stand
bearing
the
world
upon
their
shoulders
and
to
the
distant
heavens
that
arch
over
and
fold
the
earth
in
their
embrace
where
the
two
meet
at
the
far
horizon
as
pictured
in
the
korean
flag
the
blind
men
threw
their
dice
and
fearing
lest
they
should
prophesy
death
nahl
bo
quickly
paid
and
dismissed
them
the
next
gourd
was
opened
but
a
trifle
that
they
might
first
determine
as
to
the
wisdom
of
letting
out
its
contents
before
they
could
determine
however
a
voice
like
thunder
was
heard
from
within
and
the
huge
form
of
a
giant
arose
splitting
open
the
gourd
as
he
came
forth
in
his
anger
he
seized
poor
nahl
bo
and
tossed
him
upon
his
shoulders
as
though
he
would
carry
him
away
whereupon
the
wife
plead
with
tears
for
his
release
and
gladly
gave
an
order
for
the
amount
of
the
ransom
after
which
the
monster
allowed
the
frightened
man
to
fall
to
the
ground
nearly
breaking
his
aching
bones
in
the
fall
the
carpenter
did
not
relish
the
sport
any
longer
it
seemed
to
be
getting
entirely
too
dangerous
he
thereupon
demanded
the
balance
of
his
pay
which
they
finally
agreed
to
give
him
providing
he
would
open
the
last
remaining
gourd
for
the
desperate
people
hoped
to
find
this
at
least
in
sufficient
condition
that
they
might
cook
or
make
soup
of
it
since
they
had
no
food
left
at
all
and
no
money
while
the
other
gourds
were
so
spoiled
by
the
tramping
of
the
feet
of
their
unbidden
guests
as
to
be
totally
unfit
for
food
the
man
did
as
requested
but
had
only
sawed
a
very
little
when
the
gourd
split
open
as
though
it
were
rotten
while
a
most
awful
stench
arose
driving
every
one
from
the
premises
this
was
followed
by
a
gale
of
wind
so
severe
as
to
destroy
the
buildings
which
in
falling
took
fire
from
the
kang
and
while
the
once
prosperous
man
looked
on
in
helpless
misery
the
last
of
his
remaining
property
was
swept
forever
from
him
the
seed
that
had
brought
prosperity
to
his
honest
deserving
brother
had
turned
prosperity
into
ruin
to
the
cruel
covetous
nahl
bo
who
now
had
to
subsist
upon
the
charity
of
his
kind
brother
whom
he
had
formerly
treated
so
cruelly
chun

the
faithful

in
the
city
of
nam
won
in
chull

do
the
southern
province
of
korea
lived
the
prefect
ye
tung
uhi
he
was
the
happy
father
of
a
son
of
some
sixteen
years
of
age
being
an
only
child
the
boy
was
naturally
much
petted
he
was
not
an
ordinary
young
man
however
for
in
addition
to
a
handsome
manly
face
and
stalwart
figure
he
possessed
a
bright
quick
mind
and
was
naturally
clever
a
more
dutiful
son
could
not
be
found
he
occupied
a
house
in
the
rear
of
his
father
quarters
and
devoted
himself
to
his
books
going
regularly
each
evening
to
make
his
obeisance
to
his
father
and
express
his
wish
that
pleasant
refreshing
sleep
might
come
to
him
then
in
the
morning
before
breakfasting
he
was
wont
to
go
and
enquire
how
the
new
day
had
found
his
father
the
prefect
was
but
recently
appointed
to
rule
over
the
nam
won
district
when
the
events
about
to
be
recorded
occurred
the
winter
months
had
been
spent
mostly
indoors
but
as
the
mild
spring
weather
approached
and
the
buds
began
to
open
to
the
singing
of
the
joyful
birds
ye
toh
ryung
or
toh
ryung
the
son
felt
that
he
must
get
out
and
enjoy
nature
like
an
animal
that
has
buried
itself
in
a
hole
in
the
earth
he
came
forth
rejoicing
the
bright
yellow
birds
welcomed
him
from
the
willow
trees
the
soft
breezes
fanned
his
cheeks
and
the
freshness
of
the
air
exhilarated
him
he
called
his
pang
san
valet
and
asked
him
concerning
the
neighboring
views
the
servant
was
a
native
of
the
district
and
knew
the
place
well
he
enumerated
the
various
places
especially
prized
for
their
scenery
but
concluded
with
but
of
all
rare
views
hal
loo
is
the
rarest
officers
from
the
eight
provinces
come
to
enjoy
the
scenery
and
the
temple
is
covered
with
verses
they
have
left
in
praise
of
the
place
very
well
then
we
will
go
there
said
toh
ryung
go
you
and
clean
up
the
place
for
my
reception
the
servant
hurried
off
to
order
the
temple
swept
and
spread
with
clean
mats
while
his
young
master
sauntered
along
almost
intoxicated
by
the
freshness
and
new
life
of
every
thing
around
him
arrived
at
the
place
after
a
long
tedious
ascent
of
the
mountain
side
he
flung
himself
upon
a
huge
cushion
and
with
eyes
drank
in
the
beauty
of
the
scene
along
with
the
balmy
spring
zephyrs
he
called
his
servant
and
congratulated
him
upon
his
taste
declaring
that
were
the
gods
in
search
of
a
fine
view
they
could
not
find
a
place
that
would
surpass
this
to
which
the
man
answered
that
is
true
so
true
in
fact
that
it
is
well
known
that
the
spirits
do
frequent
this
place
for
its
beauty
as
he
said
this
toh
ryung
had
raised
himself
and
was
leaning
on
one
arm
gazing
out
toward
one
side
when
as
though
it
were
one
of
the
spirits
just
mentioned
the
vision
of
a
beautiful
girl
shot
up
into
the
air
and
soon
fell
back
out
of
sight
in
the
shrubbery
of
an
adjoining
he
could
just
get
a
confused
picture
of
an
angelic
face
surrounded
by
hair
like
the
black
a
neck
of
ravishing
beauty
and
a
dazzle
of
bright
silks
when
the
whole
had
vanished
he
was
dumb
with
amazement
for
he
felt
sure
he
must
have
seen
one
of
the
spirits
said
to
frequent
the
place
but
before
he
could
speak
the
vision
arose
again
and
he
then
had
time
to
see
that
it
was
but
a
beautiful
girl
swinging
in
her
dooryard
he
did
not
move
he
scarcely
breathed
but
sat
with
bulging
eyes
absorbing
the
prettiest
view
he
had
ever
seen
he
noted
the
handsome
laughing
face
the
silken
black
hair
held
back
in
a
coil
by
a
huge
coral
pin
he
saw
the
jewels
sparkling
on
the
gay
robes
the
dainty
white
hands
and
full
round
arms
from
which
the
breezes
blew
back
the
sleeves
and
as
she
flew
higher
in
her
wild
sport
oh
joy
two
little
shoeless
feet
encased
in
white
stockings
shot
up
among
the
peach
blossoms
causing
them
to
fall
in
showers
all
about
her
in
the
midst
of
the
sport
her
hairpin
loosened
and
fell
allowing
her
raven
locks
to
float
about
her
shoulders
but
alas
the
costly
ornament
fell
on
a
rock
and
broke
for
toh
ryung
could
hear
the
sharp
click
where
he
sat
this
ended
the
sport
and
the
little
maid
disappeared
all
unconscious
of
the
agitation
she
had
caused
in
a
young
man
breast
by
her
harmless
spring
exercise
after
some
silence
the
young
man
asked
his
servant
if
he
had
seen
any
thing
for
even
yet
he
feared
his
mind
had
been
wandering
close
to
the
dreamland
after
some
joking
the
servant
confessed
to
having
seen
the
girl
swinging
whereupon
his
master
demanded
her
name
she
is
uhl
mahs
daughter
a
gee
sang
public
dancing
girl
of
this
city
her
name
is
chun
yang
ye

yah

then
and
have
her
sing
and
dance
for
me
exclaimed
toh
ryung
go
and
call
her
at
once
you
slave
the
man
ran
over
good
road
and
bad
alike
up
hill
and
down
panting
as
he
went
for
while
the
back
of
the
women
quarters
of
the
adjoining
compound
was
near
at
hand
the
entrance
had
to
be
reached
by
a
long
circuit
arriving
out
of
breath
he
pounded
at
the
gate
calling
the
girl
by
name
who
is
that
calls
me
she
enquired
when
the
noise
had
attracted
her
attention
oh
never
mind
who
answered
the
exhausted
man
it
is
great
business
open
the
door
who
are
you
and
what
do
you
want
i
am
nobody
and
i
want
nothing
but
ye
toh
ryung
is
the
son
and
he
wants
to
see
the
fragrant
spring
who
told
ye
toh
ryung
my
name
never
mind
who
told
him
if
you
did
not
want
him
to
know
you
then
why
did
you
swing
so
publicly
the
great
man
son
came
here
to
rest
and
see
the
beautiful
views
he
saw
you
swinging
and
can
see
nothing
since
you
must
go
but
you
need
not
fear
he
is
a
gentleman
and
will
treat
you
nicely
if
your
dancing
pleases
him
as
did
your
swinging
he
may
present
you
with
rich
gifts
for
he
is
his
father
only
son
regretting
in
her
proud
spirit
that
fates
had
placed
her
in
a
profession
where
she
was
expected
to
entertain
the
nobility
whether
it
suited
her
or
not
the
girl
combed
and
arranged
her
hair
tightened
her
sash
smoothed
her
disordered
clothes
and
prepared
to
look
as
any
vain
woman
would
wish
who
was
about
to
be
presented
to
the
handsomest
and
most
gifted
young
nobleman
of
the
province
she
followed
the
servant
slowly
till
they
reached
toh
ryung
stopping
place
she
waited
while
the
servant
announced
her
arrival
for
a
gee
sang
must
not
enter
a
nobleman
presence
unbidden
toh
ryung
was
too
excited
to
invite
her
in
however
and
his
servant
had
to
prompt
him
when
laughing
at
his
own
agitation
he
pleasantly
bade
her
enter
and
sit
down
what
is
your
name
asked
he
my
name
is
chun
yang
ye
she
said
with
a
voice
that
resembled
silver
jingling
in
a
pouch
how
old
are
you
my
age
is
just
twice
eight
years
ah
ha
laughed
the
now
composed
boy
how
fortunate
you
are
twice
eight
and
i
am
four
fours
we
are
of
the
same
age
your
name
fragrant
spring
is
the
same
as
your
face
very
beautiful
your
cheeks
are
like
the
petals
of
the
mah
hah
that
ushers
in
the
soft
spring
your
eyes
are
like
those
of
the
eagle
sitting
on
the
ancient
tree
but
soft
and
gentle
as
the
moonlight
ran
on
the
enraptured
youth
when
is
your
birthday
my
birthday
occurs
at
midnight
on
the
eighth
day
of
the
fourth
moon
modestly
replied
the
flattered
girl
who
was
quickly
succumbing
to
the
charms
of
the
ardent
and
handsome
young
fellow
whose
heart
she
could
see
was
already
her
own
is
it
possible
exclaimed
he
that
is
the
date
of
the
lantern
festival
and
it
is
also
my
own
birthday
only
i
was
born
at
eleven
instead
of
twelve
i
am
sorry
i
was
not
born
at
twelve
now
but
it
does
matter
surely
the
gods
had
some
motive
in
sending
us
into
the
world
at
the
same
time
and
thus
bringing
us
together
at
our
sixteenth
heaven
must
have
intended
us
to
be
man
and
wife
and
he
bade
her
sit
still
as
she
started
as
though
to
take
her
departure
then
he
began
to
plead
with
her
pacing
the
room
in
his
excitement
till
his
attendant
likened
the
sound
to
the
combat
of
ancient
warriors
this
chance
meeting
of
ours
has
a
meaning
he
argued
often
when
the
buds
were
bursting
or
when
the
forest
trees
were
turning
to
fire
and
blood
have
i
played
and
supped
with
pretty
gee
sang
watched
them
dance
and
wrote
them
verses
but
never
before
have
i
lost
my
heart
never
before
have
i
seen
any
one
so
incomparably
beautiful
you
are
no
common
mortal
you
were
destined
to
be
my
wife
you
must
be
mine
you
must
marry
me
she
wrinkled
her
fair
brow
and
thought
for
she
was
no
silly
foolish
thing
and
while
her
heart
was
almost
if
not
quite
won
by
this
tempestuous
lover
yet
she
saw
where
his
blind
love
would
not
let
him
see
you
know
she
said
the
son
of
a
nobleman
may
not
marry
a
gee
sang
without
the
consent
of
his
parents
i
know
i
am
a
gee
sang
by
name
the
fates
have
so
ordained
but
nevertheless
i
am
an
honorable
woman
always
have
been
and
expect
to
remain
so
certainly
he
answered
we
can
not
celebrate
the
customs
ceremony
parental
arrangements
exchange
of
letters
contracts
exchange
of
presents
preliminary
visits
ceremony
proper
but
we
can
be
privately
married
just
the
same
no
it
can
not
be
your
father
would
not
consent
and
should
we
be
privately
married
and
your
father
be
ordered
to
duty
at
some
other
place
you
would
not
dare
take
me
with
you
then
you
would
marry
the
daughter
of
some
nobleman
and
i
would
be
forgotten
it
must
not
can
not
be
and
she
arose
to
depart
stay
stay
he
begged
you
do
me
an
injustice
i
will
never
forsake
you
or
marry
another
i
swear
it
and
a
yang
ban
noble
has
but
one
mouth
he
can
not
speak
two
ways
even
should
we
leave
this
place
i
will
take
you
with
me
or
return
soon
to
you
you
must
not
refuse
me
but
suppose
you
change
your
mind
or
forget
your
promises
words
fly
out
of
the
mouth
and
are
soon
lost
ink
and
paper
are
more
lasting
give
me
your
promises
in
writing
she
says
instantly
the
young
man
took
up
paper
and
brush
having
rubbed
the
ink
well
he
wrote
a
memorandum
desiring
to
enjoy
the
spring
scenery
i
came
to
kang
hal
loo
there
i
saw
for
the
first
time
my
bride

for
the
first
time

pledge
myself
for
one
hundred
years
to
be
her
faithful
husband
should
i
change
show
this
paper
to
the
magistrate
folding
up
the
manuscript
with
care
he
handed
it
to
her
while
putting
it
into
her
pocket
she
said
speech

no
legs
yet
it
can
travel
many
thousands
of
miles
suppose
this
matter
should
reach
your
father
ears
what
would
you
do
never
fear
my
father
was
once
young
who
knows
but
i
may
be
following
the
example
of
his
early
days
i
have
contracted
with
you
and
we
now
are
married
even
my
father
can
not
change
it
should
he
discover
our
alliance
and
disown
me
i
will
still
be
yours
and
together
we
shall
live
and
die
she
arose
to
go
and
pointing
with
her
hand
to
a
clump
of
bamboos
said
there
is
my
house
as
i
can
not
come
to
you
you
must
come
to
me
and
make
my
mother
house
your
home
as
much
as
your
duty
to
your
parents
will
allow
as
the
sun
began
to
burn
red
above
the
mountains
peaks
they
bade
each
other
a
fond
adieu
and
each
departed
for
home
accompanied
by
their
respective
attendants
ye
toh
ryung
went
to
his
room
which
now
seemed
a
place
instead
of
the
pleasant
study
he
had
found
it
he
took
up
a
book
but
reading
was
no
satisfaction
every
word
seemed
to
transform
itself
into
chun
or
yang
every
thought
was
of
the
little
maid
of
the
spring
fragrance
he
changed
his
books
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
even
keep
them
right
side
up
not
to
mention
using
them
properly
instead
of
singing
off
his
lessons
as
usual
he
kept
singing
chun
yang
ye
poh
go
sip
so
i
want
to
see
the
spring
fragrance
till
his
father
hearing
the
confused
sounds
sent
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
with
his
son
the
boy
was
singing
as
the
parched
earth
cries
for
rain
after
the
seven
years
drought
so
my
heart
pants
for
my
chun
yang
ye
whose
face
to
me
is
like
the
rays
of
the
sun
upon
the
earth
after
a
nine
years
rain
he
paid
no
heed
to
the
servants
and
soon
his
father
sent
his
private
secretary
demanding
what
it
was
the
boy
desired
so
much
that
he
should
keep
singing
i
want
to
see
i
want
to
see
toh
ryung
answered
that
he
was
reading
an
uninteresting
book
and
looking
for
another
though
he
remained
more
quiet
after
this
he
still
was
all
impatience
to
be
off
to
his
and
calling
his
attendant
he
sent
him
out
to
see
how
near
the
sun
was
to
setting
enjoying
the
sport
the
man
returned
saying
the
sun
was
now
high
over
head
begone
said
he
can
any
one
hold
back
the
sun
it
had
reached
the
mountain
tops
before
i
came
home
at
last
the
servant
brought
his
dinner
for
which
he
had
no
appetite
he
could
ill
abide
the
long
delay
between
the
dinner
hour
and
the
regular
time
for
his
father
retiring
the
time
did
come
however
and
when
the
lights
were
extinguished
and
his
father
had
gone
to
sleep
he
took
his
trusty
servant
and
scaling
the
back
wall
they
hurried
to
the
house
of
chun
yang
ye
as
they
approached
they
heard
someone
playing
the
harp
and
singing
of
the
dull
pace
of
the
hours
when
one
lover
is
away
being
admitted
they
met
the
mother
who
with
some
distrust
received
toh
assurances
and
sent
him
to
her
daughter
apartments
the
house
pleased
him
it
was
neat
and
the
public
room
facing
the
court
was
lighted
by
a
blue
lantern
which
in
the
mellow
light
resembled
a
pleasure
barge
drifting
on
the
spring
flood
banners
of
poetry
hung
upon
the
walls
upon
the
door
leading
to
chun
little
parlor
hung
a
banner
inscribed
with
verses
to
her
ancestors
and
descendants
praying
that
a
century
be
short
to
span
her
life
and
happiness
and
that
her
children
children
be
blessed
with
prosperity
for
a
thousand
years
through
the
open
windows
could
be
seen
moonlight
glimpses
of
the
little
garden
of
the
swinging
girl
there
was
a
miniature
lake
almost
filled
with
lotus
plants
where
two
sleepy
swans
floated
with
heads
beneath
their
wings
while
the
occasional
gleam
of
a
gold
or
silver
scale
showed
that
the
water
was
inhabited
a
on
the
water
edge
was
almost
covered
with
fragrant
spring
blossoms
the
whole
being
enclosed
in
a
little
grove
of
bamboo
and
willows
that
shut
out
the
view
of
outsiders
while
gazing
at
this
restful
sight
chun
yang
ye
herself
came
out
and
all
was
lost
in
the
lustre
of
her
greater
beauty
she
asked
him
into
her
little
parlor
where
was
a
profusion
of
choice
carved
cabinets
and
ornaments
of
jade
and
metal
while
richly
embroidered
mats
covered
the
floor
she
was
so
delighted
that
she
took
both
his
hands
in
her
pretty
white
soft
ones
and
gazing
longingly
into
each
other
eyes
she
led
him
into
another
room
where
on
a
low
table
a
most
elegant
lunch
was
spread
they
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
surveyed
the
loaded
table
there
were
fruits
preserved
in
sugar
candied
nuts
arranged
in
many
dainty
nested
boxes
sweet
pickles
and
confections
pears
that
had
grown
in
the
warmth
of
a
summer
now
dead
and
grapes
that
had
been
saved
from
decay
by
the
same
sun
that
had
called
them
forth
quaint
old
bottles
with
long
twisted
necks
contained
choice
medicated
wines
to
be
drunk
from
the
little
crackled
cups
such
as
the
ancients
used
pouring
out
a
cup
she
sang
to
him
this
is
the
elixir
of
youth
drinking
this
may
you
never
grow
old
though
ten
thousand
years
pass
over
your
head
may
you
stand
like
the
mountain
that
never
changes
he
drank
half
of
the
cup
contents
and
praised
her
sweet
voice
asking
for
another
song
she
sang
let
us
drain
the
cup
while
we
may
in
the
grave
who
will
be
our
while
we
are
young
let
us
play
when
old
mirth
gives
place
to
care
the
flowers
can
bloom
but
a
few
days
at
best
and
must
then
die
that
the
seed
may
be
born
the
moon
is
no
sooner
full
than
it
begins
to
wane
that
the
young
moon
may
rise
the
sentiments
suited
him
the
wine
exhilarated
him
and
his
spirits
rose
he
drained
his
cup
and
called
for
more
wine
and
song
but
she
restrained
him
they
ate
the
dainty
food
and
more
wine
and
song
followed
she
talked
of
the
sweet
contract
they
had
made
and
anon
they
pledged
themselves
anew
not
content
with
promises
for
this
short
life
they
went
into
the
future
and
he
yielded
readily
to
her
request
that
when
death
should
at
last
them
she
would
enter
a
flower
while
he
would
become
a
butterfly
coming
and
resting
on
her
bosom
and
feasting
off
her
fragrant
sweetness
the
father
did
not
know
of
his
son
recent
alliance
though
the
young
man
honestly
went
and
removed
chun
yang
name
from
the
list
of
the
district
gee
sang
kept
in
his
father
office
for
now
that
she
was
a
married
woman
she
need
no
longer
go
out
with
the
every
morning
as
before
the
dutiful
son
presented
himself
before
his
father
with
respectful
inquiries
after
his
health
and
his
rest
the
preceding
night
but
nevertheless
each
night
the
young
man
apartments
were
deserted
while
he
spent
the
time
in
the
house
of
his
wife
thus
the
months
rolled
on
with
amazing
speed
the
lovers
were
in
paradise
the
father
enjoyed
his
work
and
labored
hard
for
the
betterment
of
the
condition
of
his
subjects
never
before
had
so
large
a
tribute
been
sent
by
this
district
yet
the
people
were
not
burdened
as
much
as
when
far
less
of
their
products
reached
the
government
granaries
the
honest
integrity
of
the
officer
reached
the
king
in
many
reports
and
when
a
vacancy
occurred
at
the
head
of
the
treasury
department
he
was
raised
to
be
ho
joh
pansa
secretary
of
finance
delighted
the
father
sent
for
his
son
and
told
him
the
news
but
to
his
amazement
the
young
man
had
naught
to
say
in
fact
he
seemed
as
one
struck
dumb
as
well
he
might
within
himself
there
was
a
great
tumult
his
heart
beat
so
violently
as
to
seem
perceptible
and
at
times
it
arose
and
filled
his
throat
cutting
off
any
speech
he
might
wish
to
utter
surprised
at
the
conduct
of
his
son
the
father
bade
him
go
and
inform
his
mother
that
she
might
order
the
packing
to
commence
he
went
but
soon
found
a
chance
to
fly
to
chun
yang
who
at
first
was
much
concerned
for
his
health
as
his
looks
denoted
a
serious
illness
when
he
had
made
her
understand
however
despair
seized
her
and
they
gazed
at
each
other
in
mute
dismay
and
utter
helplessness
at
last
she
seemed
to
awaken
from
her
stupor
and
in
an
agony
of
despair
she
beat
her
breast
and
moaned
oh
how
can
we
separate
we
must
die
we
can
not
live
apart
and
tears
coming
to
her
relief
she
cried
if
we
say
it
will
be
forever
we
can
never
meet
again
oh
i
feared
it
we
have
been
too
happy
too
happy
the
one
who
made
this
order
is
a
murderer
it
must
be
my
death
if
you
go
to
seoul
and
leave
me
i
must
die
i
am
but
a
poor
weak
woman
and
i
can
not
live
without
you
he
took
her
and
laying
her
head
on
his
breast
tried
to
soothe
her
do
cry
so
bitterly
he
begged
my
heart
is
almost
broken
now
i
can
not
bear
it
i
wish
it
could
always
be
but
this
is
only
like
the
cruel
winter
that
lingering
in
the
mountain
sometimes
sweeps
down
the
valley
drives
out
the
spring
and
kills
the
blossoms
we
will
not
give
up
and
die
though
we
have
contracted
for
one
hundred
years
and
this
will
be
but
a
bitter
separation
that
will
make
our
speedy
reunion
more
blissful
oh
she
says
but
how
can
i
live
here
alone
with
you
in
seoul
just
think
of
the
long
tedious
summer
days
the
long
and
lonely
winter
nights
i
must
see
no
one
i
can
not
know
of
you
for
who
will
tell
me
and
how
am
i
to
endure
it
had
not
my
father
been
given
this
great
honor
we
would
perhaps
not
have
been
parted
as
it
is
i
must
go
there
is
no
help
for
it
but
you
must
believe
me
when
i
promise
i
will
come
again
here
take
this
crystal
mirror
as
a
pledge
that
i
will
keep
my
word
and
he
gave
her
his
of
rock
crystal
promise
me
when
you
will
return
said
she
and
then
without
awaiting
an
answer
she
sang
when
the
sear
and
withered
trunk
begins
to
bloom
and
the
dead
bird
sings
in
the
branches
then
my
lover
will
come
to
me
when
the
river
flows
over
the
eastern
mountains
then
may
i
see
him
glide
along
in
his
ship
to
me
he
chided
her
for
her
lack
of
faith
and
assured
her
again
it
was
as
hard
for
one
as
the
other
after
a
time
she
became
more
reconciled
and
taking
off
her
jade
ring
gave
it
to
him
for
a
keepsake
saying
my
love
like
this
ring
knows
no
end
you
must
go
alas
but
my
love
will
go
with
you
and
may
it
protect
you
when
crossing
wild
mountains
and
distant
rivers
and
bring
you
again
safely
to
me
if
you
go
to
seoul
you
must
not
trifle
but
take
your
books
study
hard
and
enter
the
examinations
then
perhaps
you
may
obtain
rank
and
come
to
me
i
will
stand
with
my
hand
shading
my
eyes
ever
watching
for
your
return
promising
to
cherish
her
speech
with
her
image
in
his
breast
they
made
their
final
adieu
and
tore
apart
the
long
journey
seemed
like
a
funeral
to
the
lover
everywhere
her
image
rose
before
him
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
by
the
time
he
arrived
at
the
capital
he
had
made
up
his
mind
as
to
his
future
course
and
from
that
day
forth
his
parents
wondered
at
his
stern
determined
manner
he
shut
himself
up
in
his
room
with
his
books
he
would
neither
go
out
or
form
acquaintances
among
the
young
noblemen
of
the
gay
city
thus
he
spent
months
in
hard
study
taking
no
note
of
passing
events
in
the
meantime
a
new
magistrate
came
to
nam
won
he
was
a
politician
he
associated
with
the
dissolute
and
devoted
himself
to
riotous
living
instead
of
caring
for
the
welfare
of
the
people
he
had
not
been
long
in
the
place
till
he
had
heard
so
much
of
the
matchless
beauty
of
chun
yang
ye
that
he
determined
to
see
and
if
as
reported
marry
her
accordingly
he
called
the
clerk
of
the
yamen
and
asked
concerning
the
beautiful
gee
sang
chun
yang
ye
the
clerk
answered
that
such
a
name
had
appeared
on
the
records
of
the
dancing
girls
but
that
it
had
been
removed
as
she
had
contracted
a
marriage
with
the
son
of
the
previous
magistrate
and
was
now
a
lady
of
position
and
respectability
you
lying
rascal
yelled
the
enraged
officer
who
could
ill
brook
any
interference
with
plans
he
had
formed
a
nobleman
son
can
not
really
marry
a
dancing
girl
leave
my
presence
at
once
and
summon
this
remarkable
to
appear
before
me
the
clerk
could
only
do
as
he
was
bidden
and
summoning
the
yamen
runners
he
sent
to
the
house
of
chun
yang
ye
to
acquaint
her
with
the
official
order
the
runners
being
natives
of
the
locality
were
loath
to
do
as
commanded
and
when
the
fair
young
woman
gave
them
wine
money
they
willingly
agreed
to
report
her
too
sick
to
attend
the
court
upon
doing
so
however
the
wrath
of
their
master
came
down
upon
them
they
were
well
beaten
and
then
commanded
to
go
with
a
chair
and
bring
the
woman
sick
or
well
while
if
they
disobeyed
him
a
second
time
they
would
be
put
to
death
of
course
they
went
but
after
they
had
explained
to
chun
yang
ye
their
treatment
her
beauty
and
concern
for
their
safety
so
affected
them
that
they
offered
to
go
back
without
her
and
face
their
doom
she
would
not
hear
to
their
being
sacrificed
for
her
sake
and
prepared
to
accompany
them
she
disordered
her
hair
soiled
her
fair
face
and
clad
herself
in
dingy
gowns
which
however
seemed
only
to
cause
her
natural
beauty
the
more
to
shine
forth
she
wept
bitterly
on
entering
the
yamen
which
fired
the
anger
of
the
official
he
ordered
her
to
stop
her
crying
or
be
beaten
and
then
as
he
looked
at
her
disordered
and
face
that
resembled
choice
jade
spattered
with
mud
he
found
that
her
beauty
was
not
overstated
what
does
your
conduct
mean
said
he
why
have
you
not
presented
yourself
at
this
office
with
the
other
gee
sang
because
though
born
a
gee
sang
i
am
by
marriage
a
lady
and
not
subject
to
the
rules
of
my
former
profession
she
answered
hush
roared
the
prefect
no
more
of
this
nonsense
present
yourself
here
with
the
other
gee
sang
or
pay
the
penalty
never
she
bravely
cried
a
thousand
deaths
first
you
have
no
right
to
exact
such
a
thing
of
me
you
are
the
king
servant
and
should
see
that
the
laws
are
executed
rather
than
violated
the
man
was
fairly
beside
himself
with
wrath
at
this
and
ordered
her
chained
and
thrown
into
prison
at
once
the
people
all
wept
with
her
which
but
increased
her
oppressor
anger
and
calling
the
jailer
he
ordered
him
to
treat
her
with
especial
rigor
and
be
extra
vigilant
lest
some
sympathizers
should
assist
her
to
escape
the
jailer
promised
but
nevertheless
he
made
things
as
easy
for
her
as
was
possible
under
the
circumstances
her
mother
came
and
moaned
over
her
daughter
condition
declaring
that
she
was
foolish
in
clinging
to
her
faithless
husband
who
had
brought
all
this
trouble
upon
them
the
neighbors
however
upbraided
the
old
woman
for
her
words
and
assured
the
daughter
that
she
had
done
just
right
and
would
yet
be
rewarded
they
brought
presents
of
food
and
endeavored
to
make
her
condition
slightly
less
miserable
by
their
attentions
she
passed
the
night
in
bowing
before
heaven
and
calling
on
the
gods
and
her
husband
to
release
her
and
in
the
morning
when
her
mother
came
she
answered
the
latter
inquiries
as
to
whether
she
was
alive
or
not
in
a
feeble
voice
which
alarmed
her
parent
i
am
still
alive
but
surely
dying
i
can
never
see
my
toh
ryung
again
but
when
i
am
dead
you
must
take
my
body
to
seoul
and
bury
it
near
the
road
over
which
he
travels
the
most
that
even
in
death
i
may
be
near
him
though
separated
in
life
again
the
mother
scolded
her
for
her
devotion
and
for
making
the
contract
that
binds
her
strongly
to
such
a
man
she
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
begged
her
mother
that
she
would
go
away
and
come
to
see
her
no
more
if
she
had
no
pleasanter
speech
than
such
to
make
i
followed
the
dictates
of
my
heart
and
my
mind
i
did
what
was
right
can
i
foretell
the
future
because
the
sun
shines
are
we
assured
that
it
will
shine
the
deed
is
done
i
do
not
regret
it
leave
me
to
my
grief
but
do
not
add
to
it
by
your
unkindness
thus
the
days
lengthened
into
months
but
she
seemed
like
one
dead
and
took
no
thought
of
time
or
its
flight
she
was
really
ill
and
would
have
died
but
for
the
kindness
of
the
jailer
at
last
one
night
she
dreamed
that
she
was
in
her
own
room
dressing
and
using
the
little
mirror
toh
ryung
had
given
her
when
without
apparent
cause
it
suddenly
broke
in
halves
she
awoke
startled
and
felt
sure
that
death
was
now
to
liberate
her
from
her
sorrows
for
what
other
meaning
could
the
strange
occurrence
have
than
that
her
body
was
thus
to
be
broken
although
anxious
to
die
and
be
free
she
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
leaving
this
world
without
a
last
look
at
her
loved
husband
whose
hands
alone
could
close
her
eyes
when
her
spirit
had
departed
pondering
much
upon
the
dream
she
called
the
jailer
and
asked
him
to
summon
a
blind
man
as
she
wished
her
fortune
told
the
jailer
did
so
it
was
no
trouble
for
almost
as
she
spoke
they
heard
one
picking
his
way
along
the
street
with
his
long
stick
and
uttering
his
peculiar
call
he
came
in
and
sat
down
when
they
soon
discovered
that
they
were
friends
for
before
the
man
became
blind
he
had
been
in
comfortable
circumstances
and
had
known
her
father
intimately
she
therefore
asked
him
to
be
to
her
as
a
kind
father
and
faithfully
tell
her
when
and
how
death
would
come
to
her
he
said
when
the
blossoms
fade
and
fall
they
do
not
die
their
life
simply
enters
the
seed
to
bloom
again
death
to
you
would
but
liberate
your
spirit
to
shine
again
in
a
fairer
body
she
thanked
him
for
his
kind
generalities
but
was
impatient
and
telling
her
dream
she
begged
a
careful
interpretation
of
it
he
promptly
answered
that
to
be
an
ill
omen
a
mirror
in
breaking
must
make
a
noise
and
on
further
questioning
he
found
that
in
her
dream
a
bird
had
flown
into
the
room
just
as
the
mirror
was
breaking
i
see
said
he
the
bird
was
bearer
of
good
news
and
the
breaking
of
the
mirror
which
toh
ryung
gave
you
indicates
that
the
news
concerned
him
let
us
see
thereupon
he
arranged
a
bunch
of
sticks
shook
them
well
while
uttering
his
chant
and
threw
them
upon
the
floor
then
he
soon
answered
that
the
news
was
good
your
husband
has
done
well
he
has
passed
his
examinations
been
promoted
and
will
soon
come
to
you
she
was
too
happy
to
believe
it
thinking
the
old
man
had
made
it
up
to
please
his
old
friend
distressed
child
yet
she
cherished
the
dream
and
the
interpretation
in
her
breast
finding
in
it
solace
to
her
weary
troubled
heart
in
the
meantime
ye
toh
ryung
had
continued
his
studious
work
day
and
night
to
the
anxiety
of
his
parents
just
as
he
began
to
feel
well
prepared
for
the
contest
he
awaited
a
royal
proclamation
announced
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
peace
reigned
throughout
the
whole
country
that
the
closing
year
had
been
one
of
prosperity
and
no
national
calamity
had
befallen
the
country
his
gracious
majesty
had
ordered
a
grand
guaga
or
competitive
examination
to
be
held
as
soon
as
it
became
known
literary
pilgrims
began
to
pour
in
from
all
parts
of
the
country
bent
on
improving
their
condition
the
day
of
the
examination
found
a
vast
host
seated
on
the
grass
in
front
of
the
pavilion
where
his
majesty
and
his
officers
were
ye
toh
ryung
was
given
as
a
subject
for
his
composition
a
lad
playing
in
the
shade
of
a
pine
tree
is
questioned
by
an
aged
wayfarer
the
young
man
long
rubbed
his
on
the
stone
thinking
very
intently
meanwhile
but
when
he
began
to
write
in
the
beautiful
characters
for
which
he
was
noted
he
seemed
inspired
and
the
composition
rolled
forth
as
though
he
had
committed
it
from
the
ancient
classics
he
made
the
boy
express
such
sentiments
of
reverence
to
age
as
would
have
charmed
the
ancients
and
the
wisdom
he
put
into
the
conversation
was
worthy
of
a
king
the
matter
came
so
freely
that
his
task
was
soon
finished
in
fact
many
were
still
wrinkling
their
brows
in
preliminary
thought
while
he
was
carefully
folding
up
his
paper
concealing
his
name
so
that
the
author
should
not
be
recognized
till
the
paper
had
been
judged
on
its
merits
he
tossed
his
composition
into
the
pen
and
it
was
at
once
inspected
being
the
first
one
and
remarkably
quickly
done
when
his
majesty
heard
it
read
and
saw
the
perfect
characters
he
was
astonished
such
excellence
in
writing
composition
and
sentiment
was
unparalleled
and
before
any
other
papers
were
received
it
was
known
that
none
could
excel
this
one
the
writer
name
was
ascertained
and
the
king
was
delighted
to
learn
that
was
the
son
of
his
favorite
officer
the
young
man
was
sent
for
and
received
the
congratulations
of
his
king
the
latter
gave
him
the
usual
three
glasses
of
wine
which
he
drank
with
modesty
he
was
then
given
a
wreath
of
flowers
from
the
king
own
hands
the
court
hat
was
presented
to
him
with
lateral
wings
denoting
the
rapidity
as
the
flight
of
a
bird
with
which
he
must
execute
his
sovereign
commands
richly
embroidered
were
given
him
to
be
worn
over
the
front
and
back
of
his
court
robes
he
then
went
forth
riding
on
a
gayly
caparisoned
horse
preceded
by
a
band
of
palace
musicians
and
attendants
everywhere
he
was
greeted
with
the
cheers
of
the
populace
as
for
three
days
he
devoted
his
time
to
this
public
display
this
duty
having
been
fulfilled
he
devotedly
went
to
the
graves
of
his
ancestors
and
prostrated
himself
with
offerings
before
them
bemoaning
the
fact
that
they
could
not
be
present
to
rejoice
in
his
success
he
then
presented
himself
before
his
king
humbly
thanking
him
for
his
gracious
condescension
in
bestowing
such
great
honors
upon
one
so
utterly
unworthy
his
sovereign
was
pleased
and
told
the
young
man
to
strive
to
imitate
the
example
of
his
honest
father
he
then
asked
him
what
position
he
wished
ye
toh
ryung
answered
that
he
wished
no
other
position
than
one
that
would
enable
him
to
be
of
service
to
his
king
the
year
has
been
one
of
great
prosperity
said
he
the
plentiful
harvest
will
tempt
corrupt
men
to
oppress
the
people
to
their
own
advantage
i
would
like
therefore
should
it
meet
with
your
majesty
approval
to
undertake
the
arduous
duties
of
ussa
government
inspector
he
said
this
as
he
knew
he
would
then
be
free
to
go
in
search
of
his
wife
while
he
could
also
do
much
good
at
the
same
time
the
king
was
delighted
and
had
his
appointment
a
private
one
naturally
made
at
once
giving
him
the
peculiar
seal
of
the
office
the
new
ussa
disguised
himself
as
a
beggar
putting
on
straw
sandals
a
broken
hat
underneath
which
his
hair
uncombed
and
without
the
encircling
band
to
hold
it
in
place
streamed
out
in
all
directions
he
wore
no
white
strip
in
the
neck
of
his
shabby
gown
and
with
dirty
face
he
certainly
presented
a
beggarly
appearance
presenting
himself
at
the
stables
outside
of
the
city
where
horses
and
attendants
are
provided
for
the
ussas
he
soon
arranged
matters
by
showing
his
seal
and
with
proper
attendants
started
on
his
journey
towards
his
former
home
in
the
southern
province
arriving
at
his
destination
he
remained
outside
in
a
miserable
hamlet
while
his
servants
went
into
the
city
to
investigate
the
people
and
learn
the
news
it
was
again
the
buds
were
bursting
the
birds
were
singing
and
in
the
warm
valley
a
band
of
farmers
were
plowing
with
lazy
bulls
and
singing
meanwhile
a
grateful
song
in
praise
of
their
just
king
their
peaceful
prosperous
country
and
their
full
stomachs
as
the
ussa
came
along
in
his
disguise
he
began
to
jest
with
them
but
they
did
not
like
him
and
were
rude
in
their
jokes
at
his
expense
when
an
old
man
evidently
the
father
cautioned
them
to
be
careful
do
you
see
said
he
this
man
speech
is
only
half
made
up
of
our
common
talk
he
is
playing
a
part
i
think
he
must
be
a
gentleman
in
disguise
the
ussa
drew
the
old
man
into
conversation
asking
about
various
local
events
and
finally
questioning
him
concerning
the
character
of
the
prefect
is
he
just
or
oppressive
drunken
or
sober
does
he
devote
himself
to
his
duties
or
give
himself
up
to
riotous
living
our
magistrate
we
know
little
of
his
heart
is
as
hard
and
unbending
as
the
dead
heart
of
the
ancient
oak
he
cares
not
for
the
people
the
people
care
not
for
him
but
to
avoid
him
he
extorts
rice
and
money
unjustly
and
spends
his
gains
in
riotous
living
he
has
imprisoned
and
beaten
the
fair
chun
yang
ye
because
she
repulsed
him
and
she
now
lies
near
to
death
in
the
prison
because
she
married
and
is
true
to
the
poor
dog
of
a
son
of
our
former
just
magistrate
ye
toh
ryung
was
stung
by
these
unjust
remarks
filled
with
the
deepest
anxiety
for
his
wife
and
the
bitterest
resentment
toward
the
brute
of
an
official
whom
he
promised
himself
soon
to
bring
to
justice
as
he
moved
away
too
full
of
emotion
for
further
conversation
he
heard
the
farmers
singing
why
are
some
men
born
to
riches
others
born
to
toil
some
to
marry
and
live
in
peace
others
too
poor
to
possess
a
hut
he
walked
away
meditating
he
had
placed
himself
down
on
the
people
level
and
began
to
feel
with
them
thus
meditating
he
crossed
a
valley
through
which
a
cheery
mountain
brook
rushed
merrily
along
near
its
banks
in
front
of
a
poor
hut
sat
an
aged
man
twisting
twine
accosting
him
the
old
man
paid
no
attention
he
repeated
his
salutation
when
the
old
man
surveying
him
from
head
to
foot
said
in
the
government
service
age
does
not
count
for
much
there
rank
is
every
thing
an
aged
man
may
have
to
bow
to
a
younger
who
is
his
superior
officer
is
not
so
in
the
country
however
here
age
alone
is
respected
then
why
am
i
addressed
thus
by
such
a
miserable
looking
stripling
the
young
man
asked
his
elder
pardon
and
then
requested
him
to
answer
a
question
i
hear
says
he
that
the
new
magistrate
is
about
to
marry
the
gee
sang
chun
yang
ye
is
it
true
do
mention
her
name
said
the
old
man
angrily
you
are
not
worthy
to
speak
of
her
she
is
dying
in
prison
because
of
her
loyal
devotion
to
the
brute
beast
who
married
and
deserted
her
ye
toh
ryung
could
hear
no
more
he
hurried
from
the
place
and
finding
his
attendants
announced
his
intention
of
going
at
once
into
the
city
lest
the
officials
should
hear
of
his
presence
and
prepare
for
him
entering
the
city
he
went
direct
to
chun
yang
house
it
presented
little
of
the
former
pleasant
appearance
most
of
the
rich
furniture
had
been
sold
to
buy
comforts
for
the
imprisoned
girl
the
mother
seeing
him
come
and
supposing
him
to
be
a
beggar
almost
shrieked
at
him
to
get
away
are
you
such
a
stranger
that
you
do
know
the
news
my
only
child
is
imprisoned
my
husband
long
since
dead
my
property
almost
gone
and
you
come
to
me
for
alms
begone
and
learn
the
news
of
the
town
look
do
you
know
me
i
am
ye
toh
ryung
your
he
said
ye
toh
ryung
and
a
beggar
oh

not
be
our
only
hope
is
in
you
and
now
you
are
worse
than
helpless
my
poor
girl
will
die
what
is
the
matter
with
her
said
he
pretending
the
woman
related
the
history
of
the
past
months
in
full
not
sparing
the
man
in
the
least
giving
him
such
a
rating
as
only
a
woman
can
he
then
asked
to
be
taken
to
the
prison
and
she
accompanied
him
with
a
strange
feeling
of
gratification
in
her
heart
that
after
all
she
was
right
and
her
daughter
confidence
was
arriving
at
the
prison
the
mother
expressed
her
feelings
by
calling
to
her
daughter
here
is
your
wonderful
husband
you
have
been
so
anxious
to
simply
see
ye
toh
ryung
before
you
die
here
he
is
look
at
the
beggar
and
see
what
your
devotion
amounts
to
curse
him
and
send
him
away
the
ussa
called
to
her
and
she
recognized
the
voice
i
surely
must
be
dreaming
again
she
said
as
she
tried
to
arise
but
she
had
the
huge
board
upon
her
shoulders
that
marked
the
latest
of
her
tormentor
acts
of
oppression
and
could
not
get
up
stung
by
the
pain
and
the
calmness
of
her
lover
voice
she
sarcastically
asked
why
have
you
not
come
to
me
have
you
been
so
busy
in
official
life
have
the
rivers
been
so
deep
and
rapid
that
you
dared
not
cross
them
did
you
go
so
far
away
that
it
has
required
all
this
time
to
retrace
your
steps
and
then
regretting
her
harsh
words
she
said
i
can
not
tell
my
rapture
i
had
expected
to
have
to
go
to
heaven
to
meet
you
and
now
you
are
here
get
them
to
unbind
my
feet
and
remove
this
yoke
from
my
neck
that
i
may
come
to
you
he
came
to
the
little
window
through
which
food
is
passed
and
looked
upon
her
as
she
saw
his
face
and
garb
she
moaned
oh
what
have
we
done
to
be
so
afflicted
you
can
not
help
me
now
we
must
die
heaven
has
deserted
us
yes
he
answered
granting
i
am
poor
yet
should
we
not
be
happy
in
our
reunion
i
have
come
as
i
promised
and
we
will
yet
be
happy
do
yourself
no
injury
but
trust
to
me
she
called
her
mother
who
sneeringly
inquired
of
what
service
she
could
be
now
that
the
husband
had
returned
in
answer
to
her
prayers
she
paid
no
attention
to
these
cruel
words
but
told
her
mother
of
certain
jewels
she
had
concealed
in
a
case
in
her
room
sell
these
she
said
and
buy
some
food
and
raiment
for
my
husband
take
him
home
and
care
for
him
well
have
him
sleep
on
my
couch
and
do
not
reproach
him
for
what
he
can
not
help
he
went
with
the
old
woman
but
soon
left
to
confer
with
his
attendants
who
informed
him
that
the
next
day
was
the
birthday
of
the
magistrate
and
that
great
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
celebration
that
would
commence
early
a
great
feast
when
wine
would
flow
like
water
was
to
take
place
in
the
morning
the
gee
sang
from
the
whole
district
were
to
perform
for
the
assembled
guests
bands
of
music
were
practising
for
the
occasion
and
the
whole
bade
fair
to
be
a
great
riotous
debauch
which
would
afford
the
ussa
just
the
opportunity
the
consummation
of
his
plans
awaited
early
the
next
morning
the
disguised
ussa
presented
himself
at
the
yamen
gate
where
the
servants
jeered
at
him
telling
him
this
is
no
beggars
feast
and
driving
him
away
he
hung
around
the
street
however
listening
to
the
music
inside
and
finally
he
made
another
attempt
which
was
more
successful
than
the
first
for
the
servants
thinking
him
crazy
tried
to
restrain
him
when
in
the
melée
he
made
a
passage
and
rushed
through
the
inner
gate
into
the
court
off
the
reception
hall
the
annoyed
host
red
with
wine
ordered
him
at
once
ejected
and
the
gate
men
whipped
his
order
was
promptly
obeyed
but
ye
did
not
leave
the
place
he
found
a
break
in
the
outside
wall
through
which
he
climbed
and
again
presented
himself
before
the
feasters
while
the
prefect
was
too
blind
with
rage
to
be
able
to
speak
the
stranger
said
i
am
a
beggar
give
me
food
and
drink
that
i
too
may
enjoy
myself
the
guests
laughed
at
the
man
presumption
and
thinking
him
crazy
they
urged
their
host
to
humor
him
for
their
entertainment
to
which
he
finally
consented
and
sending
him
some
food
and
wine
bade
him
stay
in
a
corner
and
eat
to
the
surprise
of
all
the
fellow
seemed
still
discontented
for
he
claimed
that
as
the
other
guests
each
had
a
fair
gee
sang
to
sing
a
wine
song
while
they
drank
he
should
be
treated
likewise
this
amused
the
guests
immensely
and
they
got
the
master
to
send
one
the
girl
went
with
a
poor
grace
however
saying
one
would
think
from
the
looks
of
you
that
your
poor
throat
would
open
to
the
wine
without
a
song
to
oil
it
and
sang
him
a
song
that
wished
him
speedy
death
instead
of
long
life
after
submitting
to
their
taunts
for
some
time
he
said
i
thank
you
for
your
food
and
wine
and
the
graciousness
of
my
reception
in
return
for
which
i
will
amuse
you
by
writing
you
some
verses
and
taking
pencil
and
paper
he
wrote
the
oil
that
enriches
the
food
of
the
official
is
but
the
life
blood
of
the
people
whose
tears
are
of
no
more
merit
in
the
eyes
of
the
oppressor
than
the
drippings
of
a
burning
candle
when
this
was
read
a
troubled
look
passed
over
all
the
guests
shook
their
heads
and
assured
their
host
that
it
meant
ill
to
him
and
each
began
to
make
excuses
saying
that
one
and
another
engagement
of
importance
called
them
hence
the
host
laughed
and
bade
them
be
seated
while
he
ordered
attendants
to
take
the
intruder
and
cast
him
into
prison
for
his
impudence
they
came
to
do
so
but
the
ussa
took
out
his
official
seal
giving
the
preconcerted
signal
meanwhile
which
summoned
his
ready
followers
at
sight
of
the
king
seal
terror
blanched
the
faces
of
each
of
the
men
the
wicked
host
tried
to
crawl
under
the
house
and
escape
but
he
was
at
once
caught
and
bound
with
chains
one
of
the
guests
in
fleeing
through
an
caught
his
topknot
of
hair
in
a
and
stood
for
some
time
yelling
for
mercy
supposing
that
his
captors
had
him
it
was
as
though
an
earthquake
had
shaken
the
house
all
was
the
wildest
confusion
the
ussa
put
on
decent
clothes
and
gave
his
orders
in
a
calm
manner
he
sent
the
magistrate
to
the
capital
at
once
and
began
to
look
further
into
the
affairs
of
the
office
soon
however
he
sent
a
chair
for
chun
yang
ye
delegating
his
own
servants
and
commanding
them
not
to
explain
what
had
happened
she
supposed
that
the
magistrate
full
of
wine
had
sent
for
her
intending
to
kill
her
and
she
begged
the
amused
servants
to
call
her
toh
ryung
to
come
and
stay
with
her
they
assured
her
that
he
could
not
come
as
already
he
too
was
at
the
yamen
and
she
feared
that
harm
had
befallen
him
on
her
account
they
removed
her
shackles
and
bore
her
to
the
yamen
where
the
ussa
addressed
her
in
a
changed
voice
commanding
her
to
look
up
and
answer
her
charges
she
refused
to
look
up
or
speak
feeling
that
the
sooner
death
came
the
better
failing
in
this
way
he
then
asked
her
in
his
own
voice
to
just
glance
at
him
surprised
she
looked
up
and
her
dazed
eyes
saw
her
lover
standing
there
in
his
proper
guise
and
with
a
delighted
cry
she
tried
to
run
to
him
but
fainted
in
the
attempt
and
was
borne
in
his
arms
to
a
room
just
then
the
old
woman
coming
along
with
food
which
she
had
brought
as
a
last
service
to
her
daughter
heard
the
good
news
from
the
excited
throng
outside
and
dashing
away
her
dishes
and
their
contents
she
tore
around
for
joy
crying
what
a
delightful
birthday
surprise
for
a
cruel
magistrate
all
the
people
rejoiced
with
the
daughter
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
the
old
mother
deserved
such
good
fortune
the
ussa
conduct
was
approved
at
court
a
new
magistrate
was
appointed
the
marriage
was
publicly
solemnized
at
seoul
and
the
ussa
was
raised
to
a
high
position
in
which
he
was
just
to
the
people
who
loved
him
for
his
virtues
while
the
country
rang
with
the
praises
of
his
faithful
wife
who
became
the
mother
of
many
children
sim
chung
the
dutiful
daughter
sim
hyun
or
sim
was
highly
esteemed
in
the
korean
village
in
which
he
resided
he
belonged
to
the
yang
ban
or
gentleman
class
and
when
he
walked
forth
it
was
with
the
stately
swinging
stride
of
the
gentleman
while
if
he
bestrode
his
favorite
donkey
or
was
carried
in
his
chair
a
runner
went
ahead
calling
out
to
the
commoners
to
clear
the
road
his
rank
was
not
high
and
though
greatly
esteemed
as
a
scholar
his
income
would
scarcely
allow
of
his
taking
the
position
he
was
fitted
to
occupy
his
parents
had
been
very
fortunate
in
betrothing
him
to
a
remarkably
beautiful
and
accomplished
maiden
daughter
of
a
neighboring
gentleman
she
was
noted
for
beauty
and
grace
while
her
mental
qualities
were
the
subject
of
continual
admiration
she
could
not
only
read
and
write
her
native
ernmun
but
was
skilled
in
chinese
characters
while
her
embroidered
shoes
pockets
and
other
feminine
articles
were
the
pride
of
her
mother
and
friends
she
had
embroidered
a
set
of
historic
panels
which
her
father
sent
to
the
king
his
majesty
mentioned
her
skill
with
marked
commendation
and
had
the
panels
made
up
into
a
screen
which
for
some
time
stood
behind
his
mat
and
continually
called
forth
his
admiration
sim
had
not
seemed
very
demonstrative
in
regard
to
his
approaching
nuptials
but
once
he
laid
his
eyes
upon
his
betrothed
as
she
unveiled
at
the
ceremony
he
was
completely
captivated
and
brooked
with
poor
grace
the
formalities
that
had
to
be
gone
through
before
he
could
claim
her
as
his
constant
companion
it
was
an
exceptionally
happy
union
the
pair
being
intellectually
suited
to
each
other
and
each
apparently
possessing
the
bodily
attributes
necessary
to
charm
the
other
there
was
never
a
sign
of
disgust
or
disappointment
at
the
choice
their
parents
had
made
for
them
they
used
to
wander
out
into
the
little
garden
off
the
women
quarters
and
sit
in
the
moonlight
planning
for
the
future
and
enjoying
the
products
of
each
other
well
stored
mind
it
was
their
pet
desire
to
have
a
son
and
all
their
plans
seemed
to
centre
around
this
one
ambition
the
years
came
and
went
however
but
their
coveted
blessing
was
withheld
the
wife
consulted
priestesses
and
the
husband
from
long
and
great
disappointment
grew
sad
at
heart
and
cared
but
little
for
mingling
with
the
world
which
he
thought
regarded
him
with
shame
he
took
to
books
and
began
to
confine
himself
to
his
own
apartments
letting
his
poor
wife
stay
neglected
and
alone
in
the
apartments
of
the
women
from
much
study
lack
of
exercise
and
failing
appetite
he
grew
thin
and
emaciated
and
his
eyes
began
to
show
the
wear
of
and
innutrition
the
effect
upon
his
wife
was
also
bad
but
with
a
woman
fortitude
and
patience
she
bore
up
and
hoped
in
spite
of
constant
disappointment
she
worried
over
her
husband
condition
and
felt
ashamed
that
she
had
no
name
in
the
world
other
than
the
wife
of
sim
while
she
wished
to
be
known
as
the
mother
of
the
sim
of
whom
they
had
both
dreamed
by
day
and
by
night
till
dreams
had
almost
left
them
after
fifteen
years
of
childless
waiting
the
wife
of
sim
dreamed
again
this
time
her
vision
was
a
brilliant
one
and
in
it
she
saw
a
star
come
down
to
her
from
the
skies
above
the
dream
awakened
her
and
she
sent
for
her
husband
to
tell
him
that
she
knew
their
blessing
was
about
to
come
to
them
she
was
right
a
child
was
given
to
them
but
to
their
great
dismay
it
was
only
a
girl
heaven
had
kindly
prepared
the
way
for
the
little
visitor
however
for
after
fifteen
years
weary
waiting
they
were
not
going
to
look
with
serious
disfavor
upon
a
girl
however
much
their
hopes
had
been
placed
upon
the
advent
of
a
son
the
child
grew
and
the
parents
were
united
as
they
only
could
be
by
such
a
precious
bond
the
ills
of
childhood
seemed
not
to
like
the
little
one
even
the
virus
of
that
was
duly
placed
in
her
nostril
failed
to
innoculate
her
and
her
pretty
skin
remained
fresh
and
soft
like
velvet
and
totally
free
from
the
marks
of
the
dread
disease
at
three
years
of
age
she
bade
fair
to
far
surpass
her
noted
beauty
and
accomplishments
her
cheeks
were
roses
and
whenever
she
opened
her
dainty
curved
mouth
ripples
of
silvery
laughter
or
words
of
mature
wisdom
were
sure
to
be
given
forth
the
hearts
of
the
parents
that
had
previously
been
full
of
tears
were
now
light
and
full
of
contentment
and
joy
while
they
were
constantly
filled
with
pride
by
the
reports
of
the
wonderful
wisdom
of
their
child
that
continually
came
to
them
the
father
forgot
that
his
offspring
was
not
a
boy
and
had
his
child
continually
by
his
side
to
guide
his
footsteps
as
his
feeble
eyes
refused
to
perform
their
office
just
as
their
joy
seemed
too
great
to
be
lasting
it
was
suddenly
checked
by
the
death
of
the
mother
which
plunged
them
into
a
deep
grief
from
which
the
father
emerged
totally
blind
it
soon
became
a
question
as
to
where
the
daily
food
was
to
come
from
little
by
little
household
trinkets
were
given
to
the
brokers
to
dispose
of
and
in
ten
years
they
had
used
up
the
homestead
and
all
it
contained
the
father
was
now
compelled
to
ask
alms
and
as
his
daughter
was
grown
to
womanhood
she
could
no
longer
direct
his
footsteps
as
he
wandered
out
in
the
darkness
of
the
blind
one
day
in
his
journeying
he
fell
into
a
deep
ditch
from
which
he
could
not
extricate
himself
after
remaining
in
this
deplorable
condition
for
some
time
he
heard
a
step
and
called
out
for
assistance
saying
i
am
blind
not
drunk
whereupon
the
passing
stranger
said
i
know
full
well
you
are
not
drunk
true
you
are
blind
yet
not
incurably
so
why
who
are
you
that
you
know
so
much
about
me
asked
the
blind
man
i
am
the
old
priest
of
the
temple
in
the
mountain
fortress
well
what
is
this
that
you
say
about
my
not
being
permanently
blind
i
am
a
prophet
and
i
have
had
a
vision
concerning
you
in
case
you
make
an
offering
of
three
hundred
bags
of
rice
to
the
buddha
of
our
temple
you
will
be
restored
to
sight
you
will
be
given
rank
and
dignity
while
your
daughter
will
become
the
first
woman
in
all
korea
but
i
am
poor
as
well
as
blind
was
the
reply
how
can
i
promise
such
a
princely
offering
you
may
give
me
your
order
for
it
and
pay
it
along
as
you
are
able
said
the
priest
very
well
give
me
pencil
and
paper
whereupon
they
retired
to
a
house
and
the
blind
man
gave
his
order
for
the
costly
price
of
his
sight
returning
home
weary
bruised
and
hungry
he
smiled
to
himself
in
spite
of
his
ill
condition
at
the
thought
of
his
giving
an
order
for
so
much
rice
when
he
had
not
a
grain
of
it
to
eat
he
obtained
finally
a
little
work
in
pounding
rice
in
the
stone
mortars
it
was
hard
labor
for
one
who
had
lived
as
he
had
done
but
it
kept
them
from
starving
and
his
daughter
prepared
his
food
for
him
as
nicely
as
she
knew
how
one
night
as
the
dinner
was
spread
on
the
little
low
table
before
him
sitting
on
the
floor
the
priest
came
and
demanded
his
pay
the
old
blind
man
lost
his
appetite
for
his
dinner
and
refused
to
eat
he
had
to
explain
to
his
daughter
the
compact
he
had
made
with
the
priest
and
while
she
was
filled
with
grief
and
dismayed
at
the
enormity
of
the
price
she
yet
seemed
to
have
some
hope
that
it
might
be
accomplished
and
his
sight
restored
that
night
after
her
midnight
bath
she
lay
down
on
a
mat
in
the
open
air
and
gazed
up
to
heaven
to
which
she
prayed
that
her
poor
father
might
be
restored
to
health
and
sight
while
thus
engaged
she
fell
asleep
and
dreamed
that
her
mother
came
down
from
heaven
to
comfort
her
and
told
her
not
to
worry
that
a
means
would
be
found
for
the
payment
of
the
rice
and
that
soon
all
would
be
happy
again
in
the
little
family
the
next
day
she
chanced
to
hear
of
the
wants
of
a
great
merchant
who
sailed
in
his
large
boats
to
china
for
trade
but
was
greatly
distressed
by
an
evil
spirit
that
lived
in
the
water
through
which
he
must
pass
for
some
time
it
was
stated
he
had
not
been
able
to
take
his
boats
over
this
dangerous
place
and
his
loss
therefrom
was
very
great
at
last
it
was
reported
that
he
was
willing
and
anxious
to
appease
the
spirit
by
making
the
offering
the
wise
men
had
deemed
necessary
priests
had
told
him
that
the
sacrifice
of
a
young
maiden
to
the
spirit
would
quiet
it
and
remove
the
trouble
he
was
therefore
anxious
to
find
the
proper
person
and
had
offered
a
great
sum
to
obtain
such
an
one
sim
chung
our
heroine
hearing
of
this
decided
that
it
must
be
the
fulfilment
of
her
dream
and
having
determined
to
go
and
offer
herself
she
put
on
old
clothes
and
fasted
while
journeying
that
she
might
look
wan
and
haggard
like
one
in
mourning
she
had
previously
prepared
food
for
her
father
and
explained
to
him
that
she
wished
to
go
and
bow
at
her
mother
grave
in
return
to
her
for
having
appeared
to
her
in
a
dream
when
the
merchant
saw
the
applicant
he
was
at
once
struck
with
her
beauty
and
dignity
of
carriage
in
spite
of
her
attempt
to
disguise
herself
he
said
that
it
was
not
in
his
heart
to
kill
people
especially
maidens
of
such
worth
as
she
seemed
to
be
he
advised
her
not
to
apply
but
she
told
her
story
and
said
she
would
give
herself
for
the
three
hundred
bags
of
rice
ah
now
i
see
the
true
nobility
of
your
character
i
did
not
know
that
such
filial
piety
existed
outside
the
works
of
the
ancients
i
will
send
to
my
master
and
secure
the
rice
said
the
man
who
happened
to
be
but
an
overseer
for
a
greater
merchant
she
got
the
rice
and
took
it
to
the
priest
in
a
long
procession
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
ponies
each
laboring
under
two
heavy
bags
the
debt
cancelled
and
her
doom
fixed
she
felt
the
relaxation
and
grief
necessarily
consequent
upon
such
a
condition
she
could
not
explain
to
her
father
she
mourned
over
the
loneliness
that
would
come
to
him
after
she
was
gone
and
wondered
how
he
would
support
himself
after
she
was
removed
and
until
his
sight
should
be
restored
she
lay
down
and
prayed
to
heaven
saying
i
am
only
fourteen
years
old
and
have
but
four
more
hours
to
live
what
will
become
of
my
poor
father
oh
who
will
care
for
him
kind
heaven
protect
him
when
i
am
gone
wild
with
grief
she
went
and
sat
on
her
father
knee
but
could
not
control
her
sobs
and
tears
whereupon
he
asked
her
what
the
trouble
could
be
having
made
up
her
mind
that
the
time
had
come
and
that
the
deed
was
done
and
could
not
be
remedied
she
decided
to
tell
him
and
tried
to
break
it
gently
but
when
the
whole
truth
dawned
upon
the
poor
old
man
it
nearly
killed
him
he
clasped
her
close
to
his
bosom
and
crying
my
child
my
daughter
my
only
comfort
i
will
not
let
you
go
what
will
eyes
be
to
me
if
i
can
no
longer
look
upon
your
lovely
face
they
mingled
their
tears
and
sobs
and
the
neighbors
hearing
the
commotion
in
the
usually
quiet
hut
came
to
see
what
was
the
trouble
upon
ascertaining
the
reason
of
the
old
man
grief
they
united
in
the
general
wailing
sim
chung
begged
them
to
come
and
care
for
the
old
man
when
she
could
look
after
him
no
more
and
they
agreed
to
do
so
while
the
wailing
and
heart
breaking
was
going
on
a
stranger
rode
up
on
a
donkey
and
asked
for
the
sim
family
he
came
just
in
time
to
see
what
the
act
was
costing
the
poor
people
he
comforted
the
girl
by
giving
her
a
cheque
for
fifty
bags
of
rice
for
the
support
of
the
father
when
his
daughter
should
be
no
more
she
took
it
gratefully
and
gave
it
to
the
neighbors
to
keep
in
trust
she
then
prepared
herself
took
a
last
farewell
and
left
her
fainting
father
to
go
to
her
bed
in
the
sea
in
due
time
the
boat
that
bore
sim
chung
at
the
head
of
a
procession
of
boats
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
evil
spirit
reigned
she
was
dressed
in
bridal
garments
furnished
by
the
merchant
on
her
arrival
at
the
place
the
kind
merchant
tried
once
more
to
appease
the
spirit
by
an
offering
of
eatables
but
it
was
useless
whereupon
sim
chung
prayed
to
heaven
bade
them
all
and
leaped
into
the
sea
above
all
was
quiet
the
waves
subsided
the
sea
became
like
a
lake
and
the
boats
passed
on
their
way
unmolested
when
sim
chung
regained
her
consciousness
she
was
seated
in
a
little
boat
drawn
by
fishes
and
pretty
maidens
were
giving
her
to
drink
from
a
carved
jade
bottle
she
asked
them
who
they
were
and
where
she
was
going
they
answered
we
are
servants
of
the
king
of
the
sea
and
we
are
taking
you
to
his
palace
sim
chung
wondered
if
this
was
death
and
thought
it
very
pleasant
if
it
were
they
passed
through
forests
of
waving
plants
and
saw
great
lazy
fish
feeding
about
in
the
water
till
at
last
they
reached
the
confines
of
the
palace
her
amazement
was
then
unbounded
for
the
massive
walls
were
composed
of
precious
stones
such
as
she
had
only
heretofore
seen
used
as
ornaments
pearls
were
used
to
cover
the
heads
of
nails
in
the
great
doors
through
which
they
passed
and
everywhere
there
seemed
a
most
costly
and
lavish
display
of
the
precious
gems
and
metals
while
the
walks
were
made
of
polished
black
marble
that
shone
in
the
water
the
light
as
it
passed
through
the
water
seemed
to
form
most
beautifully
colored
clouds
and
the
rainbow
colors
were
everywhere
disporting
themselves
soon
a
mighty
noise
was
heard
and
they
moved
aside
while
the
king
passed
by
preceded
by
an
army
with
gayly
colored
and
beautifully
embroidered
satin
banners
each
bearer
blowing
on
an
enormous
shell
the
king
was
borne
in
a
golden
chair
on
the
shoulders
of
one
hundred
men
followed
by
one
hundred
musicians
and
as
many
more
beautiful
dancing
girls
with
wonderful
and
rich
costumes
sim
chung
objected
to
going
before
such
an
august
king
but
she
was
assured
of
kind
treatment
and
after
being
properly
dressed
by
the
sea
maids
in
garments
suitable
for
the
palace
of
the
sea
king
she
was
borne
in
a
chair
on
the
shoulders
of
eunuchs
to
the
apartments
the
king
treated
her
with
great
respect
and
all
the
maidens
and
eunuchs
bowed
before
her
she
protested
that
she
was
not
worthy
of
such
attention
i
am
she
said
but
the
daughter
of
a
beggar
for
whom
i
thought
i
was
giving
my
life
when
rescued
by
these
maidens
i
am
in
no
way
worthy
of
your
respect
the
king
smiled
a
little
and
said
ah
i
know
more
of
you
than
you
know
of
yourself
you
must
know
that
i
am
the
sea
king
and
that
we
know
full
well
the
doings
of
the
stars
which
shine
in
the
heaven
above
for
they
continually
visit
us
on
light
evenings
well
you
were
once
a
star
many
say
a
beautiful
one
for
you
had
many
admirers
you
favored
one
star
more
than
the
others
and
in
your
attentions
to
him
you
abused
your
office
as
to
the
king
of
heaven
and
let
your
lover
have
free
access
to
all
of
the
choice
wines
of
the
palace
in
this
way
before
you
were
aware
of
it
the
peculiar
and
choice
brands
that
the
king
especially
liked
were
consumed
and
upon
examination
your
fault
became
known
as
punishment
the
king
decided
to
banish
you
to
earth
but
fearing
to
send
you
both
at
once
lest
you
might
be
drawn
together
there
he
sent
your
lover
first
and
after
keeping
you
in
prison
for
a
long
time
you
were
sent
as
daughter
to
your
former
lover
he
is
the
man
you
claim
as
father
heaven
has
seen
your
filial
piety
however
and
repents
you
will
be
hereafter
most
highly
favored
as
a
reward
for
your
dutiful
conduct
he
then
sent
her
to
fine
apartments
prepared
for
her
where
she
was
to
rest
and
recuperate
before
going
back
to
earth
after
a
due
period
of
waiting
and
feasting
on
royal
food
sim
beauty
was
more
than
restored
she
had
developed
into
a
complete
woman
and
her
beauty
was
dazzling
her
cheeks
seemed
colored
by
the
beautiful
tints
of
the
waters
through
which
she
moved
with
ease
and
comfort
while
her
mind
blossomed
forth
like
a
flower
in
the
rare
society
of
the
sea
king
and
his
peculiarly
gifted
people
when
the
proper
time
arrived
for
her
departure
for
the
world
she
had
left
a
large
and
beautiful
flower
was
brought
into
her
chamber
it
was
so
arranged
that
sim
chung
could
conceal
herself
inside
of
it
while
the
delicious
perfume
and
the
juice
of
the
plant
were
ample
nourishment
when
she
had
bidden
to
her
peculiar
friends
and
taken
her
place
inside
the
flower
it
was
conveyed
to
the
surface
of
the
sea
at
the
place
where
she
had
plunged
in
she
had
not
waited
long
in
this
strange
position
before
a
boat
bore
in
sight
it
proved
to
be
the
vessel
of
her
friend
the
merchant
as
he
drew
near
his
old
place
of
danger
he
marvelled
much
at
sight
of
such
a
beautiful
plant
growing
and
blossoming
in
such
a
strange
place
where
once
only
evil
was
to
be
expected
he
was
also
intoxicated
by
the
powerful
perfume
exhaled
from
the
plant
steering
close
he
managed
to
secure
the
flower
and
place
it
safely
in
his
boat
congratulating
himself
on
securing
so
valuable
and
curious
a
present
for
his
king
for
he
decided
at
once
to
present
it
at
the
palace
if
he
could
succeed
in
getting
it
safely
there
the
plan
succeeded
the
strange
plant
with
its
stranger
tenant
was
duly
presented
to
his
majesty
who
was
delighted
with
the
gift
and
spent
his
time
gazing
upon
it
to
the
exclusion
of
state
business
he
had
a
glass
house
prepared
for
it
in
an
inner
court
and
seemed
never
to
tire
of
watching
his
new
treasure
at
night
when
all
was
quiet
sim
chung
was
wont
to
come
forth
and
rest
herself
by
walking
in
the
moonlight
but
on
one
occasion
the
king
being
indisposed
and
restless
thought
he
would
go
to
breathe
the
rich
perfume
of
the
strange
flower
and
rest
himself
in
this
way
he
chanced
to
see
sim
chung
before
she
could
conceal
herself
and
of
course
his
surprise
was
unbounded
he
accosted
her
not
without
fear
demanding
who
she
might
be
she
being
also
afraid
took
refuge
in
her
flower
when
to
the
amazement
of
both
the
flower
vanished
leaving
her
standing
alone
where
it
had
been
but
a
moment
before
the
king
was
about
to
flee
at
this
point
but
she
called
to
him
not
to
fear
that
she
was
but
a
human
being
and
no
spirit
as
he
doubtless
supposed
the
king
drew
near
and
was
at
once
lost
in
admiration
of
her
matchless
beauty
when
a
great
noise
was
heard
outside
and
eunuchs
came
stating
that
all
the
generals
with
the
heads
of
departments
were
asking
for
an
audience
on
very
important
business
his
majesty
very
reluctantly
went
to
see
what
it
all
meant
an
officer
versed
in
astronomy
stated
that
they
had
on
the
previous
night
observed
a
brilliant
star
descend
from
heaven
and
alight
upon
the
palace
and
that
they
believed
it
boded
good
to
the
royal
family
then
the
king
told
of
the
flower
and
the
wonderful
apparition
he
had
seen
in
the
divine
maiden
it
so
happened
that
the
queen
was
deceased
and
it
was
soon
decided
that
the
king
should
take
this
remarkable
maiden
for
his
wife
the
marriage
was
announced
and
preparations
all
made
as
the
lady
was
without
parents
supposably
the
ceremony
took
place
at
the
royal
wedding
hall
and
was
an
occasion
of
great
state
never
was
man
more
charmed
by
woman
than
in
this
case
the
king
would
not
leave
her
by
day
or
night
and
the
business
of
state
was
almost
totally
neglected
at
last
sim
chung
chided
her
husband
telling
him
it
was
not
manly
for
the
king
to
spend
all
his
time
in
the
quarters
that
if
he
cared
so
little
for
the
rule
as
to
neglect
it
altogether
others
might
find
occasion
to
usurp
his
place
she
enjoined
upon
him
the
necessity
of
giving
the
days
to
his
business
and
being
content
to
spend
the
nights
with
her
he
saw
her
wisdom
and
remarked
upon
it
promising
to
abide
by
her
advice
after
some
time
spent
in
such
luxury
sim
chung
became
lonely
and
mourned
for
her
poor
father
but
despaired
of
being
able
to
see
him
she
knew
not
if
he
were
alive
or
dead
and
the
more
she
thought
of
it
the
more
she
mourned
till
tears
were
in
her
heart
continually
and
not
infrequently
overflowed
from
her
beautiful
eyes
the
king
chanced
to
see
her
weeping
and
was
solicitous
to
know
the
cause
of
her
sorrow
whereupon
she
answered
that
she
was
oppressed
by
a
strange
dream
concerning
a
poor
blind
man
and
was
desirous
of
alleviating
in
some
way
the
sufferings
of
the
many
blind
men
in
the
country
again
the
king
marvelled
at
her
great
heart
and
offered
to
do
any
thing
towards
carrying
out
her
noble
purpose
together
they
agreed
that
they
would
summon
all
the
blind
men
of
the
country
to
a
great
feast
at
which
they
should
be
properly
clothed
amply
fed
and
treated
each
to
a
present
of
cash
the
edict
was
issued
and
on
the
day
appointed
for
the
feast
the
queen
secreted
herself
in
a
pavilion
from
which
she
could
look
down
and
fully
observe
the
strange
assemblage
she
watched
the
first
day
but
saw
no
one
who
resembled
her
lost
parent
again
the
second
day
she
held
her
earnest
vigil
but
in
vain
she
was
about
to
give
up
her
quest
as
useless
and
mourn
over
the
loss
of
her
father
when
as
the
feast
was
closing
on
the
third
day
a
feeble
old
man
in
rags
came
tottering
up
the
attendants
having
served
so
many
were
treating
this
poor
fellow
with
neglect
and
were
about
to
drive
him
away
as
too
late
when
the
queen
ordered
them
whipped
and
the
old
man
properly
fed
he
seemed
starved
and
grasped
at
the
food
set
before
him
with
the
eagerness
of
an
animal
there
seemed
to
be
something
about
this
forlorn
creature
that
arrested
and
engaged
the
attention
of
the
queen
and
the
attendants
noticing
this
were
careful
to
clothe
him
with
extra
care
when
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
for
the
satisfying
of
his
hunger
he
was
ordered
brought
to
the
queen
pavilion
where
her
majesty
scrutinized
him
closely
for
a
few
moments
and
then
to
the
surprise
and
dismay
of
all
her
attendants
she
screamed
my
father
my
father
and
fell
at
his
feet
senseless
her
maids
hurried
off
to
tell
the
king
of
the
strange
conduct
of
their
mistress
and
he
came
to
see
for
himself
by
rubbing
her
limbs
and
applying
medicines
to
her
nostrils
the
fainting
queen
was
restored
to
consciousness
and
allowed
to
tell
her
peculiar
and
interesting
story
the
king
had
heard
much
of
it
previously
but
the
poor
old
blind
man
could
barely
collect
his
senses
sufficiently
to
grasp
the
situation
as
the
full
truth
began
to
dawn
upon
him
he
cried
oh
my
child
can
the
dead
come
back
to
us
i
hear
your
voice
i
feel
your
form
but
how
can
i
know
it
is
you
for
i
have
no
eyes
away
with
these
sightless
orbs
and
he
tore
at
his
eyes
with
his
nails
when
to
his
utter
amazement
and
joy
the
scales
fell
away
and
he
stood
rejoicing
in
his
sight
once
more
his
majesty
was
overjoyed
to
have
his
lovely
queen
restored
to
her
wonted
happy
frame
of
mind
he
made
the
old
man
an
officer
of
high
rank
appointed
him
a
fine
house
and
had
him
married
to
the
accomplished
daughter
of
an
officer
of
suitable
rank
thereby
fulfilling
the
last
of
the
prophecy
of
both
the
aged
priest
and
the
king
of
the
sea
hong
kil
tong
or
the
adventures
of
an
abused
boy
during
the
reign
of
the
third
king
in
korea
there
lived
a
noble
of
high
rank
and
noted
family
by
name
hong
his
title
was
ye
cho
pansa
he
had
two
sons
by
his
wife
and
one
by
one
of
his
concubines
the
latter
son
was
very
remarkable
from
his
birth
to
his
death
and
he
it
is
who
forms
the
subject
of
this
history
when
hong
pansa
was
the
father
of
but
two
sons
he
dreamed
by
night
on
one
occasion
that
he
heard
the
noise
of
thunder
and
looking
up
he
saw
a
huge
dragon
entering
his
apartment
which
seemed
too
small
to
contain
the
whole
of
his
enormous
body
the
dream
was
so
startling
as
to
awaken
the
sleeper
who
at
once
saw
that
it
was
a
good
omen
and
a
token
to
him
of
a
blessing
about
to
be
conferred
he
hoped
the
blessing
might
prove
to
be
another
son
and
went
to
impart
the
good
news
to
his
wife
she
would
not
see
him
however
as
she
was
offended
by
his
taking
a
concubine
from
the
class
of
dancing
girls
the
great
man
was
sad
and
went
away
within
the
year
however
a
son
of
marvellous
beauty
was
born
to
one
concubine
much
to
the
annoyance
of
his
wife
and
to
himself
for
he
would
have
been
glad
to
have
the
beautiful
boy
a
full
son
and
eligible
to
office
the
child
was
named
kil
tong
or
hong
kil
tong
he
grew
fast
and
became
more
and
more
beautiful
he
learned
rapidly
and
surprised
every
one
by
his
remarkable
ability
as
he
grew
up
he
rebelled
at
being
placed
with
the
slaves
and
at
not
being
allowed
to
call
his
parent
father
the
other
children
laughed
and
jeered
at
him
and
made
life
very
miserable
he
refused
longer
to
study
of
the
duties
of
children
to
their
parents
he
upset
his
table
in
school
and
declared
he
was
going
to
be
a
soldier
one
bright
moonlight
night
hong
pansa
saw
his
son
in
the
practising
the
arts
of
the
soldier
and
he
asked
him
what
it
meant
kil
tong
answered
that
he
was
fitting
himself
to
become
a
man
that
people
should
respect
and
fear
he
said
he
knew
that
heaven
had
made
all
things
for
the
use
of
men
if
they
found
themselves
capable
of
using
them
and
that
the
laws
of
men
were
only
made
to
assist
a
few
that
could
not
otherwise
do
as
they
would
but
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
submit
to
any
such
tyranny
but
would
become
a
great
man
in
spite
of
his
evil
surroundings
this
is
a
most
remarkable
boy
mused
hong
pansa
what
a
pity
that
he
is
not
my
proper
and
legitimate
son
that
he
might
be
an
honor
to
my
name
as
it
is
i
fear
he
will
cause
me
serious
trouble
he
urged
the
boy
to
go
to
bed
and
sleep
but
kil
tong
said
it
was
useless
that
if
he
went
to
bed
he
would
think
of
his
troubles
till
the
tears
washed
sleep
away
from
his
eyes
and
caused
him
to
get
up
the
wife
of
hong
pansa
and
his
other
concubine
the
dancing
girl
seeing
how
much
their
lord
and
master
thought
of
kil
tong
grew
to
hate
the
latter
intensely
and
began
to
lay
plans
for
ridding
themselves
of
him
they
called
some
mootang
or
sorceresses
and
explained
to
them
that
their
happiness
was
disturbed
by
this
son
of
a
rival
and
that
peace
could
only
be
restored
to
their
hearts
by
the
death
of
this
youth
the
witches
laughed
and
said
never
mind
there
is
an
old
woman
who
lives
by
the
east
gate
tell
her
to
come
and
prejudice
the
father
she
can
do
it
and
he
will
then
look
after
his
son
the
old
hag
came
as
requested
hong
pansa
was
then
in
the
apartments
telling
them
of
the
wonderful
boy
much
to
their
annoyance
a
visitor
was
announced
and
the
old
woman
made
a
low
bow
outside
hong
pansa
asked
her
what
her
business
was
and
she
stated
that
she
had
heard
of
his
wonderful
son
and
came
to
see
him
to
foretell
what
his
future
was
to
be
kil
tong
came
as
called
and
on
seeing
him
the
hag
bowed
and
said
send
out
all
of
the
people
she
then
stated
this
will
be
a
very
great
man
if
not
a
king
he
will
be
greater
than
the
king
and
will
avenge
his
early
wrongs
by
killing
all
his
family
at
this
the
father
called
to
her
to
stop
and
enjoined
strict
secrecy
upon
her
he
sent
kil
tong
at
once
to
a
strong
room
and
had
him
locked
in
for
safe
keeping
the
boy
was
very
sad
at
this
new
state
of
affairs
but
as
his
father
let
him
have
books
he
got
down
to
hard
study
and
learned
the
chinese
works
on
astronomy
he
could
not
see
his
mother
and
his
unnatural
father
was
too
afraid
to
come
near
him
he
made
up
his
mind
however
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
out
he
would
go
to
some
far
off
country
where
he
was
not
known
and
make
his
true
power
felt
meanwhile
the
unnatural
father
was
kept
in
a
state
of
continual
excitement
by
his
wicked
concubine
who
was
bent
on
the
destruction
of
the
son
of
her
rival
and
kept
constantly
before
her
master
the
great
dangers
that
would
come
to
him
from
being
the
parent
of
such
a
man
as
kil
tong
was
destined
to
be
if
allowed
to
live
she
showed
him
that
such
power
as
the
boy
was
destined
to
possess
would
eventually
result
in
his
overthrowal
and
with
him
his
father
house
would
be
in
disgrace
and
doubtless
would
be
abolished
while
if
this
did
not
happen
the
son
was
sure
to
kill
his
family
so
that
in
either
case
it
was
the
father
clear
duty
to
prevent
any
further
trouble
by
putting
the
boy
out
of
the
way
hong
pansa
was
finally
persuaded
that
his
concubine
was
right
and
sent
for
the
assassins
to
come
and
kill
his
son
but
a
spirit
filled
the
father
with
disease
and
he
told
the
men
to
stay
their
work
medicines
failed
to
cure
the
disease
and
the
mootang
women
were
called
in
by
the
concubine
they
beat
their
drums
and
danced
about
the
room
conjuring
the
spirit
to
leave
but
it
would
not
obey
at
last
they
said
at
the
suggestion
of
the
concubine
that
kil
tong
was
the
cause
of
the
disorder
and
that
with
his
death
the
spirit
would
cease
troubling
the
father
again
the
assassins
were
sent
for
and
came
with
their
swords
accompanied
by
the
old
hag
from
the
east
gate
while
they
were
meditating
on
the
death
of
kil
tong
he
was
musing
on
the
unjust
laws
of
men
who
allowed
sons
to
be
born
of
concubines
but
denied
them
rights
that
were
enjoyed
by
other
men
while
thus
musing
in
the
darkness
of
the
night
he
heard
a
crow
caw
three
times
and
fly
away
this
means
something
ill
to
me
thought
he
and
just
then
his
window
was
thrown
open
and
in
stepped
the
assassins
they
made
at
the
boy
but
he
was
not
there
in
their
rage
they
wounded
each
other
and
killed
the
old
woman
who
was
their
guide
to
their
amazement
the
room
had
disappeared
and
they
were
surrounded
by
high
mountains
a
mighty
storm
arose
and
rocks
flew
through
the
air
they
could
not
escape
and
in
their
terror
were
about
to
give
up
when
music
was
heard
and
a
boy
came
riding
by
on
a
donkey
playing
a
flute
he
took
away
their
weapons
and
showed
himself
to
be
kil
tong
he
promised
not
to
kill
them
as
they
begged
for
their
lives
but
only
on
condition
that
they
should
never
try
to
kill
another
man
he
told
them
that
he
would
know
if
the
promise
was
broken
and
in
that
event
he
would
instantly
kill
them
kil
tong
went
by
night
to
see
his
father
who
thought
him
a
spirit
and
was
very
much
afraid
he
gave
his
father
medicine
which
instantly
cured
him
and
sending
for
his
mother
bade
her
and
started
for
an
unknown
country
his
father
was
very
glad
that
the
boy
had
escaped
and
lost
his
affection
for
his
wicked
concubine
but
the
latter
with
her
mistress
was
very
angry
and
tried
in
vain
to
devise
some
means
to
accomplish
their
evil
purposes
kil
tong
free
at
last
journeyed
to
the
south
and
began
to
ascend
the
lonely
mountains
tigers
were
abundant
but
he
feared
them
not
and
they
seemed
to
avoid
molesting
him
after
many
days
he
found
himself
high
up
on
a
barren
peak
enveloped
by
the
clouds
and
enjoyed
the
remoteness
of
the
place
and
the
absence
of
men
and
obnoxious
laws
he
now
felt
himself
a
free
man
and
the
equal
of
any
while
he
knew
that
heaven
was
smiling
upon
him
and
giving
him
powers
not
accorded
to
other
men
through
the
clouds
at
some
distance
he
thought
he
espied
a
huge
stone
door
in
the
bare
wall
of
rock
going
up
to
it
he
found
it
to
be
indeed
a
movable
door
and
opening
it
he
stepped
inside
when
to
his
amazement
he
found
himself
in
an
open
plain
surrounded
by
high
and
inaccessible
mountains
he
saw
before
him
over
two
hundred
good
houses
and
many
men
who
when
they
had
somewhat
recovered
from
their
own
surprise
came
rushing
upon
him
apparently
with
evil
intent
laying
hold
upon
him
they
asked
him
who
he
was
and
why
he
came
trespassing
upon
their
ground
he
said
i
am
surprised
to
find
myself
in
the
presence
of
men
i
am
but
the
son
of
a
concubine
and
men
with
their
laws
are
obnoxious
to
me
therefore
i
thought
to
get
away
from
man
entirely
and
for
that
reason
i
wandered
alone
into
these
wild
regions
but
who
are
you
and
why
do
you
live
in
this
lone
spot
perhaps
we
may
have
a
kindred
feeling
we
are
called
thieves
was
answered
but
we
only
despoil
the
hated
official
class
of
some
of
their
gains
we
are
willing
to
help
the
poor
unbeknown
but
no
man
can
enter
our
stronghold
and
depart
alive
unless
he
has
become
one
of
us
to
do
so
however
he
must
prove
himself
to
be
strong
in
body
and
mind
if
you
can
pass
the
examination
and
wish
to
join
our
party
well
and
good
otherwise
you
die
this
suited
kil
tong
immensely
and
he
consented
to
the
conditions
they
gave
him
various
trials
of
strength
but
he
chose
his
own
going
up
to
a
huge
rock
on
which
several
men
were
seated
he
laid
hold
of
it
and
hurled
it
to
some
distance
to
the
dismay
of
the
men
who
fell
from
their
seat
and
to
the
surprised
delight
of
all
he
was
at
once
installed
a
member
and
a
feast
was
ordered
the
contract
was
sealed
by
mingling
blood
from
the
lips
of
all
the
members
with
blood
similarly
supplied
by
kil
tong
he
was
then
given
a
prominent
seat
and
served
to
wine
and
food
kil
tong
soon
became
desirous
of
giving
to
his
comrades
some
manifestation
of
his
courage
an
opportunity
presently
offered
he
heard
the
men
bemoaning
their
inability
to
despoil
a
large
and
strong
buddhist
temple
not
far
distant
as
was
the
rule
this
temple
in
the
mountains
was
well
patronized
by
officials
who
made
it
a
place
of
retirement
for
pleasure
and
debauch
and
in
return
the
lazy
licentious
priests
were
allowed
to
collect
tribute
from
the
poor
people
about
till
they
had
become
rich
and
powerful
the
several
attempts
made
by
the
robber
band
had
proved
unsuccessful
by
virtue
of
the
number
and
vigilance
of
the
priests
together
with
the
strength
of
their
enclosure
kil
tong
agreed
to
assist
them
to
accomplish
their
design
or
perish
in
the
attempt
and
such
was
their
faith
in
him
that
they
readily
agreed
to
his
plans
on
a
given
day
kil
tong
dressed
in
the
red
gown
of
a
youth
just
betrothed
covered
himself
with
the
dust
of
travel
and
mounted
on
a
donkey
with
one
robber
disguised
as
a
servant
made
his
way
to
the
temple
he
asked
on
arrival
to
be
shown
to
the
head
priest
to
whom
he
stated
that
he
was
the
son
of
hong
pansa
that
his
noble
father
having
heard
of
the
greatness
of
this
temple
and
the
wisdom
of
its
many
priests
had
decided
to
send
him
with
a
letter
which
he
produced
to
be
educated
among
their
numbers
he
also
stated
that
a
train
of
one
hundred
ponies
loaded
with
rice
had
been
sent
as
a
present
from
his
father
to
the
priest
and
he
expected
they
would
arrive
before
dark
as
they
did
not
wish
to
stop
alone
in
the
mountains
even
though
every
pony
was
attended
by
a
groom
who
was
armed
for
defense
the
priests
were
delighted
and
having
read
the
letter
they
never
for
a
moment
suspected
that
all
was
not
right
a
great
feast
was
ordered
in
honor
of
their
noble
scholar
and
all
sat
down
before
the
tables
which
were
filled
so
high
that
one
could
hardly
see
his
neighbor
on
the
opposite
side
they
had
scarcely
seated
themselves
and
indulged
in
the
generous
wine
when
it
was
announced
that
the
train
of
ponies
laden
with
rice
had
arrived
servants
were
sent
to
look
after
the
tribute
and
the
eating
and
drinking
went
on
suddenly
kil
tong
clapped
his
hand
over
his
cheek
with
a
cry
of
pain
which
drew
the
attention
of
all
when
to
the
great
mortification
of
the
priests
he
produced
from
his
mouth
a
pebble
previously
introduced
on
the
sly
and
exclaimed
is
it
to
feed
on
stones
that
my
father
sent
me
to
this
place
what
do
you
mean
by
setting
such
rice
before
a
gentleman
the
priests
were
filled
with
mortification
and
dismay
and
bowed
their
shaven
heads
to
the
floor
in
humiliation
when
at
a
sign
from
kil
tong
a
portion
of
the
robbers
who
had
entered
the
court
as
grooms
to
the
ponies
seized
the
bending
priests
and
bound
them
as
they
were
the
latter
shouted
for
help
but
the
other
robbers
who
had
been
concealed
in
the
bags
which
were
supposed
to
contain
rice
seized
the
servants
while
others
were
loading
the
ponies
with
jewels
rice
cash
and
whatever
of
value
they
could
lay
hands
upon
an
old
priest
who
was
attending
to
the
fires
seeing
the
uproar
made
off
quietly
to
the
yamen
near
by
and
called
for
soldiers
the
soldiers
were
sent
after
some
delay
and
kil
tong
disguised
as
a
priest
called
to
them
to
follow
him
down
a
after
the
robbers
while
he
conveyed
the
soldiers
over
this
rough
path
the
robbers
made
good
their
escape
by
the
main
road
and
were
soon
joined
in
their
stronghold
by
their
youthful
leader
who
had
left
the
soldiers
groping
helplessly
in
the
dark
among
the
rocks
and
trees
in
a
direction
opposite
that
taken
by
the
robbers
the
priests
soon
found
out
that
they
had
lost
almost
all
their
riches
and
were
at
no
loss
in
determining
how
the
skilful
affair
had
been
planned
and
carried
out
kil
tong
name
was
noised
abroad
and
it
was
soon
known
that
he
was
heading
a
band
of
robbers
who
through
his
assistance
were
able
to
do
many
marvellous
things
the
robber
band
were
delighted
at
the
success
of
his
first
undertaking
and
made
him
their
chief
with
the
consent
of
all
after
sufficient
time
had
elapsed
for
the
full
enjoyment
of
their
last
and
greatest
success
kil
tong
planned
a
new
raid
the
governor
of
a
neighboring
province
was
noted
for
his
overbearing
ways
and
the
heavy
burdens
that
he
laid
upon
his
subjects
he
was
very
rich
but
universally
hated
and
kil
tong
decided
to
avenge
the
people
and
humiliate
the
governor
knowing
that
his
work
would
be
appreciated
by
the
people
as
were
indeed
his
acts
at
the
temple
he
instructed
his
band
to
proceed
singly
to
the
governor
city
the
local
capital
at
the
time
of
a
fair
when
their
coming
would
not
cause
comment
at
a
given
time
a
portion
of
them
were
to
set
fire
to
a
lot
of
huts
outside
the
city
gates
while
the
others
repaired
in
a
body
to
the
governor
yamen
they
did
so
the
governor
was
borne
in
his
chair
to
a
place
where
he
could
witness
the
conflagration
which
also
drew
away
the
most
of
the
inhabitants
the
robbers
bound
the
remaining
servants
and
while
some
were
securing
money
jewels
and
weapons
kil
tong
wrote
on
the
walls
the
wicked
governor
that
robs
the
people
is
relieved
of
his
gains
by
kil
tong
the
people
avenger
again
the
thieves
made
good
their
escape
and
kil
tong
name
became
known
everywhere
the
governor
offered
a
great
reward
for
his
capture
but
no
one
seemed
desirous
of
encountering
a
robber
of
such
boldness
at
last
the
king
offered
a
reward
after
consulting
with
his
officers
when
one
of
them
said
he
would
capture
the
thief
alone
the
king
was
astonished
at
his
boldness
and
courage
and
bade
him
be
off
and
make
the
attempt
the
officer
was
called
the
pochang
he
had
charge
of
the
prisons
and
was
a
man
of
great
courage
the
pochang
started
on
his
search
disguised
as
a
traveller
he
took
a
donkey
and
servant
and
after
travelling
many
days
he
put
up
at
a
little
inn
at
the
same
time
that
another
man
on
a
donkey
rode
up
the
latter
was
kil
tong
in
disguise
and
he
soon
entered
into
conversation
with
the
man
whose
mission
was
known
to
him
i
goo
said
kil
tong
as
he
sat
down
to
eat
this
is
a
dangerous
country
i

just
been
chased
by
the
robber

till
the
life

of
me
kil

man
of
whom
we
hear
so
much
well
if
you
see
him
once
you
will
be
satisfied
replied
kil
tong
why
asked
the
pochang
is
he
such
a
man
as
to
frighten
one
by
his
aspect
alone
no
on
the
contrary
he
looks
much
as
do
ordinary
mortals
but
we
know
he
is
different
you
see
exactly
said
the
pochang
that
is
just
the
trouble
you
are
afraid
of
him
before
you
see
him
just
let
me
get
a
glimpse
of
him
and
matters
will
be
different
i
think
well
said
kil
tong
you
can
be
easily
pleased
if
that
is
all
for
i
dare
say
if
you
go
back
into
the
mountains
here
you
will
see
him
and
get
acquainted
with
him
too
that
is
good
will
you
show
me
the
place
not
i
have
seen
enough
of
him
to
please
me
i
can
tell
you
where
to
go
however
if
you
persist
in
your
curiosity
said
the
robber
agreed
exclaimed
the
officer
let
us
be
off
at
once
lest
he
escapes
and
if
you
succeed
in
showing
him
to
me
i
will
reward
you
for
your
work
and
protect
you
from
the
thief
after
some
objection
by
kil
tong
who
appeared
to
be
reluctant
to
go
and
insisted
on
at
least
finishing
his
dinner
they
started
off
with
their
servants
into
the
mountains
night
overtook
them
much
to
the
apparent
dismay
of
the
guide
who
pretended
to
be
very
anxious
to
give
up
the
quest
at
length
however
they
came
to
the
stone
door
which
was
open
having
entered
the
robber
stronghold
the
door
closed
behind
them
and
the
guide
disappeared
leaving
the
dismayed
officer
surrounded
by
the
thieves
his
courage
had
now
left
him
and
he
regretted
his
rashness
the
robbers
bound
him
securely
and
led
him
past
their
miniature
city
into
an
enclosure
surrounded
by
houses
which
by
their
bright
colors
seemed
to
be
the
abode
of
royalty
he
was
conveyed
into
a
large
occupying
the
most
extensive
building
of
the
collection
and
there
on
a
sort
of
throne
in
royal
style
sat
his
guide
the
pochang
saw
his
mistake
and
fell
on
his
face
begging
for
mercy
kil
tong
upbraided
him
for
his
impudence
and
arrogance
and
promised
to
let
him
off
this
time
wine
was
brought
and
all
partook
of
it
that
given
to
the
officer
was
drugged
and
he
fell
into
a
stupor
soon
after
drinking
it
while
in
this
condition
he
was
put
into
a
bag
and
conveyed
in
a
marvellous
manner
to
a
high
mountain
overlooking
the
capital
here
he
found
himself
upon
recovering
from
the
effects
of
his
potion
and
not
daring
to
face
his
sovereign
with
such
a
fabulous
tale
he
cast
himself
down
from
the
high
mountain
and
was
picked
up
dead
by
in
the
morning
almost
at
the
same
time
that
his
majesty
received
word
of
the
death
of
his
officer
and
was
marvelling
at
the
audacity
of
the
murderer
in
bringing
the
body
almost
to
the
palace
doors
came
simultaneous
reports
of
great
depredations
in
each
of
the
eight
provinces
the
trouble
was
in
each
case
attributed
to
kil
tong
and
the
fact
that
he
was
reported
as
being
in
eight
far
removed
places
at
the
same
time
caused
great
consternation
official
orders
were
issued
to
each
of
the
eight
governors
to
catch
and
bring
to
the
city
at
once
the
robber
kil
tong
these
orders
were
so
well
obeyed
that
upon
a
certain
day
soon
after
a
guard
came
from
each
province
bringing
kil
tong
and
there
in
a
line
stood
eight
men
alike
in
every
respect
the
king
on
inquiry
found
that
kil
tong
was
the
son
of
hong
pansa
and
the
father
was
ordered
into
the
royal
presence
he
came
with
his
legitimate
son
and
bowed
his
head
in
shame
to
the
ground
when
asked
what
he
meant
by
having
a
son
who
would
cause
such
general
misery
and
distress
he
swooned
away
and
would
have
died
had
not
one
of
the
kil
tongs
produced
some
medicine
which
cured
him
the
son
however
acted
as
spokesman
and
informed
the
king
that
kil
tong
was
but
the
son
of
his
father
slave
that
he
was
utterly
incorrigible
and
had
fled
from
home
when
a
mere
boy
when
asked
to
decide
as
to
which
was
his
true
son
the
father
stated
that
his
son
had
a
scar
on
the
left
thigh
instantly
each
of
the
eight
men
pulled
up
the
baggy
trousers
and
displayed
a
scar
the
guard
was
commanded
to
remove
the
men
and
kill
all
of
them
but
when
they
attempted
to
do
so
the
life
had
disappeared
and
the
men
were
found
to
be
only
figures
in
straw
and
wax
soon
after
this
a
letter
was
seen
posted
on
the
palace
gate
announcing
that
if
the
government
would
confer
upon
kil
tong
the
rank
of
pansa
as
held
by
his
father
and
thus
remove
from
him
the
stigma
attaching
to
him
as
the
son
of
a
slave
he
would
stop
his
depredations
this
proposition
could
not
be
entertained
at
first
but
one
of
the
counsel
suggested
that
it
might
offer
a
solution
of
the
vexed
question
and
they
could
yet
be
spared
the
disgrace
of
having
an
officer
with
such
a
record
for
as
he
proposed
men
could
be
so
stationed
that
when
the
officer
came
to
make
his
bow
before
his
majesty
they
could
fall
upon
him
and
kill
him
before
he
arose
this
plan
was
greeted
with
applause
and
a
decree
was
issued
conferring
the
desired
rank
proclamations
to
that
effect
being
posted
in
public
places
so
that
the
news
would
reach
kil
tong
it
did
reach
him
and
he
soon
appeared
at
the
city
gate
a
great
crowd
attended
him
as
he
rode
to
the
palace
gates
but
knowing
the
plans
laid
for
him
as
he
passed
through
the
gates
and
came
near
enough
to
be
seen
of
the
king
he
was
caught
up
in
a
cloud
and
borne
away
amid
strange
music
wholly
discomfiting
his
enemies
some
time
after
this
occurrence
the
king
was
walking
with
a
few
eunuchs
and
attendants
in
the
royal
gardens
it
was
evening
time
but
the
full
moon
furnished
ample
light
the
atmosphere
was
tempered
just
to
suit
it
was
neither
cold
nor
warm
while
it
lacked
nothing
of
the
bracing
character
of
a
korean
autumn
the
leaves
were
on
the
maples
the
heavy
cloak
of
climbing
vines
that
enshrouded
the
great
wall
near
by
was
also
beautifully
colored
these
effects
could
even
be
seen
by
the
bright
moonlight
and
seated
on
a
the
royal
party
were
enjoying
the
tranquillity
of
the
scene
when
all
were
astonished
by
the
sound
of
a
flute
played
by
some
one
up
above
them
looking
up
among
the
a
man
was
seen
descending
toward
them
seated
upon
the
back
of
a
gracefully
moving
stork
the
king
imagined
it
must
be
some
heavenly
being
and
ordered
the
chief
eunuch
to
make
some
proper
salutation
but
before
this
could
be
done
a
voice
was
heard
saying
fear
not
o
king
i
am
simply
hong
pansa
kil
tong
new
title
i
have
come
to
make
my
obeisance
before
your
august
presence
and
be
confirmed
in
my
rank
this
he
did
and
no
one
attempted
to
molest
him
seeing
which
the
king
feeling
that
it
was
useless
longer
to
attempt
to
destroy
a
man
who
could
read
the
unspoken
thoughts
of
men
said
why
do
you
persist
in
troubling
the
country
i
have
removed
from
you
now
the
stigma
attached
to
your
birth
what
more
will
you
have
i
wish
said
kil
tong
with
due
humility
to
go
to
a
distant
land
and
settle
down
to
the
pursuit
of
peace
and
happiness
if
i
may
be
granted
three
thousand
bags
of
rice
i
will
gladly
go
and
trouble
you
no
longer
but
how
will
you
transport
such
an
enormous
quantity
of
rice
asked
the
king
that
can
be
arranged
said
kil
tong
if
i
may
be
but
granted
the
order
i
will
remove
the
rice
at
daybreak
the
order
was
given
kil
tong
went
away
as
he
came
and
in
the
early
morning
a
fleet
of
junks
appeared
off
the
royal
granaries
took
on
the
rice
and
made
away
before
the
people
were
well
aware
of
their
presence
kil
tong
now
sailed
for
an
island
off
the
west
coast
he
found
one
uninhabited
and
with
his
few
followers
he
stored
his
riches
and
brought
many
articles
of
value
from
his
former
his
people
he
taught
to
till
the
soil
and
all
went
well
on
the
little
island
till
the
master
made
a
trip
to
a
neighboring
island
which
was
famous
for
its
deadly
mineral
poison
a
thing
much
prized
for
tipping
the
arrows
with
kil
tong
wanted
to
get
some
of
this
poison
and
made
a
visit
to
the
island
while
passing
through
the
settled
districts
he
casually
noticed
that
many
copies
of
a
proclamation
were
posted
up
offering
a
large
reward
to
any
one
who
would
succeed
in
restoring
to
her
father
a
young
lady
who
had
been
stolen
by
a
band
of
savage
people
who
lived
in
the
mountains
kil
tong
journeyed
on
all
day
and
at
night
he
found
himself
high
up
in
the
wild
mountain
regions
where
the
poison
was
abundant
gazing
about
in
making
some
preparations
for
passing
the
night
in
this
place
he
saw
a
light
and
following
it
he
came
to
a
house
built
below
him
on
a
ledge
of
rocks
and
in
an
almost
inaccessible
position
he
could
see
the
interior
of
a
large
hall
where
were
gathered
many
hairy
men
eating
drinking
and
smoking
one
old
fellow
who
seemed
to
be
chief
was
tormenting
a
young
lady
by
trying
to
tear
away
her
veil
and
expose
her
to
the
gaze
of
the
barbarians
assembled
kil
tong
could
not
stand
this
sight
and
taking
a
poisoned
arrow
he
sent
it
direct
for
the
heart
of
the
villain
but
the
distance
was
so
great
that
he
missed
his
mark
sufficiently
to
only
wound
the
arm
all
were
amazed
and
in
the
confusion
the
girl
escaped
and
kil
tong
concealed
himself
for
the
night
he
was
seen
next
day
by
some
of
the
savage
band
who
caught
him
and
demanded
who
he
was
and
why
he
was
found
in
the
mountains
he
answered
that
he
was
a
physician
and
had
come
up
there
to
collect
a
certain
rare
medicine
only
known
to
exist
in
those
mountains
the
robbers
seemed
rejoiced
and
explained
that
their
chief
had
been
wounded
by
an
arrow
from
the
clouds
and
asked
him
if
he
could
cure
him
kil
tong
was
taken
in
and
allowed
to
examine
the
chief
when
he
agreed
to
cure
him
within
three
days
hastily
mixing
up
some
of
the
fresh
poison
he
put
it
into
the
wound
and
the
chief
died
almost
at
once
great
was
the
uproar
when
the
death
became
known
all
rushed
at
the
doctor
and
would
have
killed
him
but
kil
tong
finding
his
own
powers
inadequate
summoned
to
his
aid
his
old
friends
the
spirits
quay
sin
and
swords
flashed
in
the
air
striking
off
heads
at
every
blow
and
not
ceasing
till
the
whole
band
lay
weltering
in
their
own
blood
bursting
open
a
door
kil
tong
saw
two
women
sitting
with
covered
faces
and
supposing
them
to
be
of
the
same
strange
people
he
was
about
to
dispatch
them
on
the
spot
when
one
of
them
threw
aside
her
veil
and
implored
for
mercy
then
it
was
that
kil
tong
recognized
the
maiden
whom
he
had
rescued
the
previous
evening
she
was
marvellously
beautiful
and
already
he
was
deeply
smitten
with
her
maidenly
charms
her
voice
seemed
like
that
of
an
angel
of
peace
sent
to
quiet
the
hearts
of
rough
men
as
she
modestly
begged
for
her
life
she
told
the
story
of
her
capture
by
the
robbers
and
how
she
had
been
dragged
away
to
their
den
and
was
only
saved
from
insult
by
the
interposition
of
some
heavenly
being
who
had
in
pity
smote
the
arm
of
her
tormentor
great
was
kil
tong
joy
at
being
able
to
explain
his
own
part
in
the
matter
and
the
maiden
heart
already
won
by
the
manly
beauty
of
her
rescuer
now
overflowed
with
gratitude
and
love
remembering
herself
however
she
quickly
veiled
her
face
but
the
mischief
had
been
done
each
had
seen
the
other
and
they
could
henceforth
know
no
peace
except
in
each
other
presence
the
proclamations
had
made
but
little
impression
upon
kil
tong
and
it
was
not
till
the
lady
had
told
her
story
that
he
remembered
reading
them
he
at
once
took
steps
to
remove
the
beautiful
girl
and
her
companion
in
distress
and
not
knowing
but
that
other
of
the
savages
might
return
he
did
not
dare
to
make
search
for
a
chair
and
bearers
but
mounting
donkeys
the
little
party
set
out
for
the
home
of
the
distressed
parents
which
they
reached
safely
in
due
time
the
father
delight
knew
no
bounds
he
was
a
subject
of
korea
king
yet
he
possessed
this
island
and
ruled
its
people
in
his
own
right
and
calling
his
subjects
he
explained
to
them
publicly
the
wonderful
works
of
the
stranger
to
whom
he
betrothed
his
daughter
and
to
whom
he
gave
his
official
position
the
people
indulged
in
all
manner
of
gay
festivities
in
honor
of
the
return
of
the
lost
daughter
of
their
chief
in
respect
to
the
bravery
of
kil
tong
and
to
celebrate
his
advent
as
their
ruler
in
due
season
the
marriage
ceremonies
were
celebrated
and
the
impatient
lovers
were
given
to
each
other
embrace
their
lives
were
full
of
happiness
and
prosperity
other
outlying
islands
were
united
under
kil
tong
rule
and
no
desire
or
ambition
remained
ungratified
yet
there
came
a
time
when
the
husband
grew
sad
and
tears
swelled
the
heart
of
the
young
wife
as
she
tried
in
vain
to
comfort
him
he
explained
at
last
that
he
had
a
presentiment
that
his
father
was
either
dead
or
dying
and
that
it
was
his
duty
to
go
and
mourn
at
the
grave
with
anguish
at
the
thought
of
parting
the
wife
urged
him
to
go
taking
a
junk
laden
with
handsome
marble
slabs
for
the
grave
and
statuary
to
surround
it
and
followed
by
junks
bearing
three
thousand
bags
of
rice
he
set
out
for
the
capital
arriving
he
cut
off
his
hair
and
repaired
to
his
old
home
where
a
servant
admitted
him
on
the
supposition
that
he
was
a
priest
he
found
his
father
was
no
more
but
the
body
yet
remained
because
a
suitable
place
could
not
be
found
for
the
burial
thinking
him
to
be
a
priest
kil
tong
was
allowed
to
select
the
spot
and
the
burial
took
place
with
due
ceremony
then
it
was
that
the
son
revealed
himself
and
took
his
place
with
the
mourners
the
stone
images
and
monuments
were
erected
upon
the
nicely
sodded
grounds
kil
tong
sent
the
rice
he
had
brought
to
the
government
granaries
in
return
for
the
loan
to
him
and
regretted
that
mourning
would
prevent
his
paying
his
respects
to
his
king
he
set
out
for
his
home
with
his
true
mother
and
his
father
legal
wife
the
latter
did
not
survive
long
after
the
death
of
her
husband
but
the
poor
of
the
bright
boy
was
spared
many
years
to
enjoy
the
peace
and
quiet
of
her
bright
home
and
to
be
ministered
to
by
her
dutiful
loving
children
and
their
numerous
offspring
the
end
notes
this
law
has
recently
been
repealed
owing
to
the
fact
that
bad
men
often
molested
the
women
who
are
usually
possessed
of
costly
jewels
the
husbands
are
now
allowed
on
the
streets
as
a
protection
since
even
the
police
were
unable
to
suppress
the
outrages
alone
cats
are
indeed
rare
in
korea
while
dogs
are
as
abundant
as
in
constantinople
after
reaching
girlhood
persons
of
respectability
are
not
seen
on
the
streets
in
korea
