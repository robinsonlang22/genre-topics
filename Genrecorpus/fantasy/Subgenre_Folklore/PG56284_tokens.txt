preface
the
natives
of
a
certain
district
of
port
lincoln
when
questioned
as
to
the
cause
of
the
of
that
species
of
kangaroo
known
to
the
colonists
as
the
great
have
the
following
legend
in
reference
to
its
extinction
in
former
times
one
of
the
species
inhabited
port
lincoln
his
name
was
he
was
of
stupendous
size
and
devoured
all
those
who
attempted
to
spear
him
his
very
appearance
inspired
the
natives
with
overwhelming
terror
so
that
they
lost
all
presence
of
mind
even
flinging
away
their
at
last
however
a
match
was
found
for
the
monster
kangaroo
in
two
renowned
hunters
pilla
and
inda
who
falling
upon
its
track
near
port
lincoln
on
the
range
stretching
to
the
north
followed
and
overtook
it
on
mount
nilarro
finding
it
asleep
they
at
once
attacked
it
but
before
they
could
quite
kill
it
their
spears
became
blunt
they
then
quarrelled
with
each
other
and
pilla
stabbed
his
antagonist
with
one
of
the
blunt
spears
in
many
places
while
he
himself
received
a
severe
blow
over
his
nose
becoming
reconciled
the
friends
again
attacked
and
killed
kupirri
and
on
opening
it
found
to
their
utter
astonishment
the
dead
bodies
of
their
comrades
previously
devoured
by
the
monster
being
no
less
skilled
in
the
medical
art
than
in
hunting
they
succeeded
in
reviving
and
healing
these
unfortunate
men
they
all
then
betook
themselves
to
roasting
and
devouring
kupirri
in
return
the
feast
over
and
their
bodies
comfortably
greased
they
returned
to
their
mourning
families
who
received
them
with
every
demonstration
of
joy
at
the
happy
termination
of
their
adventures
the
two
heroes
were
afterwards
metamorphosed
into
and
gave
origin
to
two
species
of
animals
the
and
the
retaining
as
such
not
only
their
names
but
also
the
scars
of
the
wounds
that
they
inflicted
on
each
other
in
the
shape
of
a
furrow
down
the
former
s
nose
and
of
a
number
of
white
spots
sprinkled
over
the
skin
of
the
latter
a
a
from
a
pamphlet
by
schurmann
note
in
the
breccia
caves
of
the
portland
district
and
elsewhere
huge
bones
of
an
extinct
kangaroo
have
been
found
it
is
possible
therefore
that
this
legend
has
some
foundation
in
fact
which
in
the
lapse
of
time
has
moulded
itself
in
the
present
form
note
i
can
not
sit
down
without
making
an
allusion
to
a
cognate
subject
that
for
a
very
long
time
has
occupied
my
attention
i
allude
to
the
legends
and
traditions
of
the
aborigines
of
australia
it
is
possible
that
the
gentlemen
present
may
doubt
of
their
existence
but
i
beg
to
assure
them
that
the
tribes
of
australia
are
not
so
barren
in
these
particulars
as
may
be
imagined
there
is
scarcely
a
constellation
in
the
heavens
that
has
not
its
appropriate
legend
and
the
animals
of
the
land
are
invested
with
the
supernatural
capes
promontories
and
islands
of
our
shores
are
transformations
or
are
otherwise
connected
with
legendary
lore
the
origin
of
their
own
species
and
their
various
ceremonies
abound
with
singular
and
exotic
ideas
and
the
wildest
fancies
the
australian
savage
has
his
myths
legends
and
poetry
like
his
brothers
of
other
regions
and
i
mention
it
for
the
purpose
of
throwing
out
a
suggestion
to
the
members
of
the
philosophical
society
that
it
would
be
an
interesting
work
and
worthy
of
the
employment
of
some
portion
of
their
funds
to
collect
and
collate
together
these
treasures
before
the
race
disappears
from
off
the
face
of
the
land
sir
george
