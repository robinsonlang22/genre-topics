one
ruby
and
mavis
hast
thou
seen
that
lordly
castle
that
castle
by
the
sea
golden
and
red
above
it
the
clouds
float
gorgeously
trans
of
uhland
longfellow
do
you
remember
gratian
gratian
conyfer
the
godson
of
the
four
winds
the
boy
who
lived
at
the
old
farmhouse
up
among
the
moors
where
these
strange
beautiful
sisters
used
to
meet
do
you
remember
how
full
of
fancies
and
stories
gratian
little
head
was
and
how
sometimes
he
put
them
into
words
to
please
fergus
the
lame
child
he
loved
so
much
the
story
i
am
now
going
to
tell
you
is
one
of
these
i
think
it
was
their
favourite
one
i
can
not
say
that
it
is
in
the
very
words
in
which
gratian
used
to
tell
it
for
it
was
not
till
long
long
after
those
boyish
days
that
it
came
to
be
written
down
but
all
the
same
it
is
his
story
how
long
ago
it
was
i
can
not
say
nor
can
i
tell
you
exactly
where
it
was
this
is
not
a
story
for
which
you
will
require
an
atlas
nor
a
history
of
england
or
of
any
other
country
nor
a
dictionary
of
dates
all
those
wise
and
clever
and
useful
things
you
may
put
out
of
your
heads
for
a
bit
i
am
just
going
to
tell
you
a
story
it
was
somewhere
and
somewhen
and
i
think
that
will
do
the
it
was
a
castle
and
something
else
but
first
about
the
castle
it
was
really
worthy
of
the
name
for
it
was
very
old
and
very
strong
and
in
ancient
days
it
had
been
used
as
a
place
of
defence
and
had
a
look
about
it
of
not
having
forgotten
this
i
am
afraid
this
sounds
a
little
historical
i
must
take
care
it
was
very
big
too
towering
over
the
cliffs
on
which
it
stood
as
if
defying
the
winds
and
the
waves
to
do
their
worst
frowning
at
them
with
the
little
round
of
its
turrets
like
a
cross
old
ogre
but
it
was
a
castle
it
was
only
on
one
side
the
rocky
side
where
the
cliffs
went
down
precipitously
to
the
water
that
it
looked
grim
and
forbidding
inland
you
could
scarcely
have
believed
it
was
the
same
castle
at
all
for
here
towards
the
sunny
south
it
seemed
to
change
into
a
gracious
comfortable
mansion
it
did
not
look
nearly
so
high
on
this
side
for
the
turrets
had
more
the
effect
of
dimly
dark
trees
in
the
background
and
the
bright
rooms
opened
on
to
trim
lawns
and
terraces
gay
with
flowers
that
was
the
case
in
at
least
the
whole
look
of
things
varied
a
good
deal
according
to
the
seasons
in
winter
grim
as
it
was
i
do
know
but
that
the
so
to
speak
of
the
great
building
had
the
best
of
it
for
it
was
grand
to
watch
the
waves
breaking
down
below
when
you
knew
you
were
safe
and
cosy
behind
the
barred
panes
of
the
turret
windows
those
windows
pierced
in
the
walls
through
such
a
thickness
of
stone
that
each
was
like
a
little
room
within
a
room
and
even
in
winter
there
were
wonderful
sunsets
to
be
seen
from
the
children
favourite
the
one
which
had
two
windows
to
the
west
and
only
one
to
the
cold
north
for
the
something
else
was
the
children
much
more
interesting
than
the
castle
indeed
what
would
any
castle
or
any
house
be
without
them
not
that
the
castle
was
not
a
very
interesting
place
to
live
in
as
you
will
hear
but
all
i
think
need
people
to
bring
out
their
interest
people
who
have
been
sometimes
and
sometimes
people
that
still
are
there
was
a
mixture
of
both
in
my
castle
but
first
and
foremost
i
will
tell
you
of
the
children
whose
home
it
was
and
perhaps
is
yet
there
were
only
two
of
them
only
two
that
is
to
say
who
lived
there
regularly
they
were
girls
ruby
and
mavis
were
their
names
and
at
this
time
they
were
nearly
twelve
years
old
i
will
not
say
much
in
description
of
them
it
is
best
to
let
you
find
out
about
them
for
yourselves
they
were
almost
exactly
the
same
size
ruby
perhaps
a
very
little
the
taller
and
at
first
sight
every
one
thought
them
exceedingly
like
each
other
and
so
they
were
so
far
as
the
colour
of
their
hair
the
shape
of
their
features
their
eyes
and
complexions
went
they
were
pretty
little
girls
and
they
made
a
pretty
pair
but
the
more
you
got
to
know
them
the
less
alike
you
got
to
think
them
till
at
last
you
be
an
to
wonder
how
you
ever
could
have
thought
them
like
at
all
and
even
almost
at
the
first
glance
differences
were
to
be
seen
ruby
was
certainly
the
prettier
her
eyes
were
brighter
her
colour
more
brilliant
her
way
of
walking
and
holding
herself
more
graceful
even
her
very
manner
of
talking
was
more
interesting
and
attractive
what
a
charming
child
she
is
said
strangers
always
such
pretty
winning
ways
so
sweet
and
unselfish
so
clever
and
intelligent
what
a
pity
that
dull
little
mavis
is
not
more
like
her
why
i
thought
them
the
image
of
each
other
at
first
and
now
i
can
scarcely
believe
they
are
sisters
i
am
sure
poor
ruby
must
find
mavis
very
trying
she
is
so
stupid
but
ruby
is
so
good
and
patient
with
her
it
quite
adds
another
charm
to
the
dear
child
this
opinion
or
one
like
it
was
always
the
first
expressed
well
perhaps
not
but
almost
always
now
i
will
let
you
judge
for
yourselves
it
was
late
autumn
so
late
that
one
felt
inclined
to
wish
it
were
already
winter
without
any
thought
or
talk
of
a
milder
season
for
it
was
very
cold
and
though
the
castle
was
it
needed
any
amount
of
huge
fires
and
curtains
in
front
of
the
doorways
and
double
windows
and
in
the
modern
rooms
hot
air
or
to
make
it
comfortable
in
severe
weather
and
all
these
things
in
winter
it
had
but
the
housekeeper
had
rather
and
stiff
ideas
she
did
everything
by
rule
on
a
certain
day
in
the
autumn
the
winter
arrangements
were
begun
on
a
certain
day
in
the
spring
they
came
to
an
end
and
this
whatever
the
weather
was
not
a
very
good
plan
for
as
everybody
knows
the
weather
itself
is
not
so
formal
and
particular
there
are
quite
warm
mild
days
sometimes
in
late
november
and
really
bitterly
cold
ones
in
april
and
may
but
there
would
have
been
no
manner
of
use
in
trying
to
make
old
bertha
see
this
winter
stop
on
a
certain
day
and
summer
should
come
and
it
had
always
been
so
in
her
time
and
bertha
did
not
like
ways
so
everybody
shivered
and
the
more
daring
ones
of
whom
ruby
was
the
foremost
scolded
and
grumbled
but
it
was
no
use
you
may
as
well
try
to
bear
it
patiently
my
dear
said
cousin
hortensia
the
mild
weather
must
come
soon
i
will
lend
you
one
of
my
little
shawls
if
you
like
you
will
feel
warmer
when
you
have
been
out
for
a
run
cousin
hortensia
was
the
lady
who
lived
at
the
castle
to
teach
and
take
care
of
the
two
little
girls
for
their
mother
was
dead
and
their
father
was
often
away
he
had
some
appointment
at
the
court
i
am
not
sure
what
it
was
but
he
was
considered
a
very
important
person
he
was
kind
and
good
as
you
will
see
and
it
was
always
a
great
delight
to
the
children
when
he
came
home
and
a
great
sorrow
when
he
had
to
leave
cousin
hortensia
was
only
a
very
cousin
but
the
children
always
called
her
so
for
though
she
was
really
with
them
as
a
governess
as
well
as
a
friend
it
would
not
have
seemed
so
nice
to
call
her
by
any
other
name
she
was
very
gentle
and
took
the
best
care
she
could
of
them
and
she
was
clever
and
taught
them
well
but
she
was
rather
a
dreamy
sort
of
person
she
had
lived
for
many
years
a
very
quiet
life
and
knew
little
of
the
outside
world
she
had
known
and
loved
the
twins
mother
and
their
father
too
when
they
were
but
boy
and
girl
for
she
was
no
longer
young
and
she
loved
ruby
and
mavis
ruby
especially
so
dearly
that
she
could
see
no
fault
in
them
it
was
to
ruby
she
was
speaking
and
offering
a
shawl
they
were
sitting
in
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
south
side
of
the
castle
sheltered
from
the
stormy
winds
which
often
came
whirling
down
from
the
north
but
even
here
it
was
cold
or
at
least
chilly
ruby
shrugged
her
shoulders
you
always
offer
me
a
shawl
as
if
i
were
seventy
cousin
hortensia
she
said
rather
pertly
it
would
be
much
better
if
you
would
speak
to
bertha
and
on
her
having
the
fires
lighted
now
it
is
so
cold
when
i
grown
up
i
can
tell
you
wo
stand
the
old
tyranny
cousin
hortensia
looked
rather
distressed
there
was
some
sense
in
what
ruby
said
but
there
were
a
great
many
other
things
to
be
considered
all
of
which
she
could
not
explain
to
the
children
bertha
was
an
exceedingly
valuable
servant
and
if
she
were
interfered
with
and
went
away
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
get
any
one
like
her
for
it
was
necessary
that
the
castle
should
be
managed
with
economy
as
well
as
care
i
would
speak
to
bertha
if
there
was
anything
really
important
to
complain
of
she
said
but
this
weather
can
not
last
and
you
are
not
cold
at
night
are
you
no
said
mavis
not
at
all
bertha
would
never
get
all
the
work
done
unless
she
took
her
own
way
miss
hortensia
went
on
but
i
tell
you
what
i
do
ruby
i
will
have
the
fire
lighted
in
my
own
little
room
i
do
need
to
trouble
bertha
about
that
thanks
to
your
kind
father
thoughtfulness
my
little
is
always
kept
filled
by
tim
and
when
you
come
in
from
your
walk
we
will
have
tea
there
instead
of
here
and
spend
a
cosy
evening
ruby
darted
at
miss
hortensia
and
kissed
her
that
will
be
lovely
she
said
and
as
it
to
be
a
sort
of
a
treat
evening
do
tell
us
a
story
after
tea
dear
cousin
if
you
not
tired
put
in
mavis
cousin
hortensia
had
a
headache
this
morning
she
said
to
ruby
turning
to
her
rubbish
cried
ruby
but
she
checked
herself
quickly
i
do
mean
that
she
went
on
but
mavis
is
such
a
you
wo
be
tired
will
you
dear
cousin
mavis
does
care
for
stories
as
much
as
i
do
i
read
nearly
all
the
books
in
the
library
and
she
never
reads
if
she
can
help
it
i
enough
to
do
with
my
said
mavis
with
a
sigh
and
i
can
scarcely
ever
find
stories
to
read
that
i
understand
but
i
like
stories
for
then
i
can
ask
what
it
means
if
there
comes
a
puzzling
part
poor
mavis
said
ruby
contemptuously
she
always
getting
puzzled
we
must
try
to
make
your
wits
work
a
little
quicker
my
dear
said
miss
hortensia
you
will
get
to
like
reading
when
you
are
older
i
daresay
i
must
look
out
for
some
easier
for
you
but
i
love
stories
cousin
said
mavis
please
do
think
that
i
do
like
your
stories
i
do
so
like
that
one
about
when
you
came
to
the
castle
once
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
about
the
dream
you
had
i
do
care
for
stories
about
dreams
said
ruby
i
like
to
hear
about
when
cousin
hortensia
was
a
young
lady
and
went
to
balls
at
the
court
i
would
love
to
have
beautiful
dresses
and
go
to
the
court
do
you
think
father
will
take
me
when
i
grown
up
cousin
hortensia
i
daresay
he
will
you
will
both
go
probably
miss
hortensia
replied
but
you
must
not
think
too
much
of
it
or
you
may
be
disappointed
your
mother
was
very
beautiful
and
everybody
admired
her
when
she
went
out
in
the
world
but
she
always
loved
best
to
be
here
at
the
castle
ruby
made
a
face
then
i
do
think
i
like
her
she
said
i
very
tired
of
this
stupid
old
place
already
and
if
you
tell
your
to
mavis
you
must
tell
me
the
one
about
how
mother
looked
when
she
went
to
her
first
ball
she
was
dressed
all
in
white
was
she
no
mavis
answered
in
blue
wavy
changing
blue
like
the
colour
the
sea
is
sometimes
ruby
repeated
what
nonsense
is
it
nonsense
cousin
hortensia
did
our
mother
wear
all
white
at
her
first
ball
everybody
does
miss
hortensia
looked
up
in
surprise
yes
of
course
she
said
who
ever
told
you
she
wore
blue
mavis
mavis
grew
very
red
i
was
speaking
of
our
mother
she
said
it
was
the
lady
you
saw
in
your
dream
i
meant
cousin
hortensia
you
silly
girl
said
ruby
is
she
stupid
mavis
looked
ready
to
cry
you
must
get
out
of
that
habit
of
not
listening
to
what
people
say
my
dear
said
miss
hortensia
now
you
had
better
both
go
out
wrap
up
warmly
and
do
stay
very
long
and
when
you
come
in
you
will
find
me
in
my
own
room
and
you
tell
us
stories
wo
you
dear
good
cousin
said
ruby
coaxingly
as
she
put
up
her
pretty
face
for
a
kiss
if
you
tell
me
story
you
may
tell
mavis
hers
afterwards
well
well
we
see
said
miss
hortensia
smiling
i
do
so
like
the
story
of
the
blue
lady
said
mavis
very
softly
as
they
left
the
room
five
minutes
later
the
twins
were
standing
under
the
great
archway
which
led
to
the
principal
entrance
to
the
castle
at
one
end
this
archway
opened
on
to
a
winding
road
cut
in
the
rock
at
the
foot
of
which
was
a
little
sandy
cove
a
sort
of
refuge
among
the
cliffs
on
each
side
of
it
the
waves
broke
noisily
but
they
never
entirely
covered
the
cove
even
at
very
high
tides
and
except
in
exceedingly
rough
and
stormy
weather
the
water
rippled
in
gently
as
if
almost
asking
pardon
for
intruding
at
all
when
the
sea
was
out
there
was
a
scrambling
path
among
the
rocks
to
the
left
by
which
one
could
make
one
way
to
a
little
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
on
the
west
for
as
i
should
have
explained
before
the
castle
stood
almost
at
a
corner
the
turning
sharply
southwards
after
running
for
many
miles
almost
due
east
and
west
the
proper
way
to
this
hamlet
was
by
the
same
inland
road
which
led
to
the
castle
and
which
so
the
legend
ran
was
much
more
modern
than
the
building
itself
much
more
modern
at
least
than
the
north
side
of
it
that
grim
front
was
very
ancient
it
had
been
built
doubtless
for
a
safe
retreat
and
originally
had
only
been
accessible
from
the
sea
being
in
those
days
girt
round
on
the
land
side
by
enormous
walls
in
which
was
no
entrance
of
any
kind
a
part
of
these
walls
and
crumbling
still
remained
but
sufficient
had
been
pulled
down
to
give
space
for
the
pleasant
sunny
rooms
and
the
sheltered
garden
with
its
terraces
ruby
shivered
as
she
and
mavis
stood
a
moment
hesitating
in
the
archway
it
is
cold
here
she
said
the
wind
seems
to
come
from
everywhere
at
once
which
way
shall
we
go
mavis
it
would
be
a
little
warmer
at
the
back
perhaps
said
mavis
but
i
do
care
much
for
the
gardens
on
a
dull
day
like
this
nor
do
i
said
ruby
there
nothing
to
see
now
at
the
front
almost
nicer
on
a
dull
day
than
when
it
sunny
except
of
course
for
the
cold
let
go
down
to
the
cove
mavis
and
see
how
it
feels
there
it
was
curious
that
they
always
spoke
of
the
fortress
side
as
the
front
even
though
the
southern
part
of
the
building
was
what
would
have
naturally
seemed
so
i
like
to
stay
out
till
sunset
and
see
the
colours
up
in
the
turret
windows
said
mavis
as
they
clambered
down
the
rocky
path
i
wish
i
knew
which
of
these
rooms
is
the
one
where
the
blue
fairy
lady
used
to
come
i
do
think
cousin
hortensia
might
have
found
out
rubbish
said
ruby
it
was
rather
a
favourite
expression
of
hers
i
am
afraid
i
do
believe
cousin
hortensia
ever
saw
her
it
was
all
a
fancy
because
she
had
heard
about
it
if
ever
she
did
come
it
was
ages
and
ages
ago
and
i
do
believe
she
did
even
then
i
believe
one
bit
about
spirits
and
fairies
and
dreams
and
things
like
that
mavis
said
nothing
but
a
puzzled
disappointed
look
crept
into
her
eyes
perhaps
it
because
i
stupid
she
said
but
i
should
like
to
think
like
you
ruby
and
you
know
the
story
would
have
come
all
of
itself
and
cousin
hortensia
though
she
calls
it
a
dream
ca
really
explain
it
that
way
if
you
know
so
much
about
it
why
do
you
keep
teasing
to
have
it
told
again
said
ruby
impatiently
well
here
we
are
at
the
cove
what
are
we
to
do
now
mavis
looked
about
her
it
was
chilly
and
the
sky
was
grey
but
over
towards
the
west
there
was
a
lightening
the
wind
came
in
little
puffs
down
here
now
and
again
only
for
they
were
well
under
the
shelter
of
the
cliffs
and
up
above
the
old
castle
frowning
down
upon
them
his
own
children
whose
ancestors
he
had
housed
and
sheltered
and
protected
for
years
that
counted
by
centuries
suddenly
seemed
to
give
a
half
unwilling
smile
it
was
a
ray
of
thin
afternoon
sunshine
striking
across
the
turret
windows
see
see
said
mavis
the
sun
coming
out
i
sure
the
sky
must
be
pretty
and
bright
round
where
the
cottages
are
the
sea
quite
far
enough
back
and
it
going
out
do
let
us
go
and
ask
how
the
baby
joan
baby
i
mean
is
very
well
said
ruby
not
that
i
care
much
how
the
baby
is
but
there
rather
a
nice
scrambly
way
home
up
behind
joan
house
i
found
it
one
day
when
you
had
a
cold
and
were
with
me
it
brings
you
out
down
by
the
stile
into
the
little
just
where
you
never
expect
to
find
yourself
and
oh
mavis
there
such
a
queer
little
cottage
farther
along
the
shore
at
least
just
above
the
shore
that
way
i
saw
it
from
the
back
along
the
scrambly
path
i
wonder
whose
it
is
said
mavis
i
do
remember
any
cottage
that
way
oh
yes
i
think
i
remember
passing
it
one
day
long
ago
when
joan
was
our
nurse
and
she
made
me
run
on
quick
but
she
did
say
why
perhaps
it
haunted
or
some
nonsense
like
that
said
ruby
with
her
contemptuous
air
i
ask
joan
and
if
we
pass
it
i
walk
just
as
slow
as
ever
i
can
on
purpose
you
see
mavis
we
better
run
now
said
mavis
the
sands
are
pretty
firm
just
here
and
cousin
hortensia
said
we
were
to
make
ourselves
warm
have
a
race
they
had
left
the
cove
and
were
making
their
way
to
the
hamlet
by
the
foot
of
the
rocks
where
at
low
tide
there
was
a
narrow
strip
of
pebbly
sand
only
here
and
there
broken
by
crags
which
the
children
found
it
very
amusing
to
clamber
over
their
voices
sounded
clear
and
high
in
the
air
for
the
wind
seemed
to
have
fallen
with
the
receding
tide
by
the
time
they
reached
the
cottages
they
were
both
in
a
glow
and
ruby
had
quite
forgotten
her
indignation
at
old
bertha
fireless
rooms
chapter
two
winfried
and
somewhat
southward
toward
the
noon
whence
lies
a
way
up
to
the
moon
and
thence
the
fairy
can
as
soon
pass
to
the
earth
below
it
drayton
joan
a
young
woman
who
had
once
been
the
nurse
and
was
now
married
to
a
fisherman
who
owned
several
boats
and
was
a
person
of
some
consequence
among
the
villagers
was
standing
at
the
door
of
her
cottage
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
as
the
children
came
up
her
face
beamed
with
smiles
but
before
she
had
time
to
speak
ruby
called
out
to
her
how
are
you
joan
we
come
round
to
ask
how
baby
is
but
it
very
easy
to
see
he
is
better
otherwise
you
would
be
so
smiling
and
here
he
is
to
speak
for
himself
miss
ruby
said
joan
how
very
kind
of
you
to
think
of
him
and
you
too
miss
mavis
my
dear
are
you
both
quite
well
yes
thank
you
joan
said
mavis
quietly
but
ruby
was
fussing
about
the
baby
admiring
him
and
petting
him
in
a
way
that
could
scarcely
fail
to
gain
his
mother
heart
joan
however
though
fond
of
both
the
children
had
plenty
of
discernment
she
smiled
at
ruby
miss
ruby
has
pretty
ways
with
her
there
no
denying
she
told
her
husband
afterwards
but
there
was
a
very
gentle
tone
in
her
voice
as
she
turned
to
mavis
you
had
no
more
headaches
i
hope
miss
mavis
have
you
been
working
hard
at
your
lessons
i
have
to
work
hard
if
i
work
at
all
joan
said
the
little
girl
rather
sadly
she
so
stupid
said
ruby
and
she
gets
her
head
full
of
fancies
i
daresay
that
prevents
her
having
room
for
sensible
things
oh
joan
tell
us
who
lives
in
that
queer
cottage
all
by
itself
some
way
farther
along
the
coast
i
never
saw
it
till
the
other
day
it
almost
hidden
among
the
rocks
but
mavis
says
she
once
passed
it
with
you
and
you
made
her
run
by
quickly
why
did
you
joan
i
do
so
want
to
know
joan
looked
rather
at
a
loss
you
mean
old
adam
cottage
she
said
i
really
do
know
why
people
speak
against
him
he
never
done
any
harm
indeed
he
a
kind
old
man
but
he
come
from
a
long
way
off
and
he
not
like
the
other
folk
and
they
got
up
a
tale
that
there
were
queer
sounds
and
sights
in
his
cottage
sometimes
singing
and
lights
late
at
night
that
be
canny
some
spoke
of
mermaids
swimming
down
below
in
front
of
his
hut
and
him
standing
talking
to
them
quite
but
that
a
good
while
ago
now
and
i
think
it
forgotten
and
he
goes
to
church
regularly
you
always
be
sure
of
seeing
him
there
then
why
do
people
like
him
said
mavis
perhaps
it
just
because
he
is
good
and
goes
to
church
said
ruby
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
like
extra
good
people
myself
they
so
tiresome
he
not
one
to
meddle
with
others
said
joan
he
keeps
very
much
to
himself
and
his
talking
does
sound
like
ours
so
they
call
him
a
foreigner
indeed
he
often
not
heard
of
or
seen
for
weeks
and
even
months
at
a
time
unless
any
one
ill
or
in
trouble
and
then
he
seems
to
know
it
all
of
himself
and
comes
to
see
if
he
can
help
that
one
reason
why
they
think
him
uncanny
did
he
come
when
baby
was
ill
asked
ruby
joan
shook
her
head
no
for
a
wonder
he
did
perhaps
he
dead
said
ruby
indifferently
we
going
past
that
way
mavis
let
peep
in
and
see
mavis
grew
rather
pale
ruby
she
said
i
wish
you
would
you
frighten
me
miss
ruby
would
be
frightened
herself
she
only
joking
said
joan
i
do
suppose
there
aught
the
matter
still
i
do
think
better
stop
at
old
adam
it
is
like
as
if
he
was
one
of
our
own
folk
rubbish
said
ruby
again
i
off
you
can
send
your
husband
to
see
if
the
old
wizard
has
turned
us
into
frogs
or
in
case
we
are
not
heard
of
any
more
and
off
she
ran
mavis
had
to
follow
her
there
was
not
much
fear
of
ruby
really
doing
anything
rash
for
she
was
by
no
means
a
very
brave
child
still
mavis
always
felt
uncomfortable
when
her
sister
got
into
one
of
these
wild
moods
joan
she
said
gently
i
so
glad
baby
better
i
daresay
ruby
only
joking
and
then
she
ran
along
the
path
which
just
here
in
the
hamlet
was
pretty
level
and
smooth
after
ruby
they
had
quite
half
a
mile
to
go
before
they
got
to
the
lonely
cottage
it
stood
some
way
back
from
the
shore
and
great
craggy
rocks
near
at
hand
almost
hid
it
from
sight
one
might
have
passed
by
that
way
often
without
noticing
that
there
was
any
human
there
but
the
children
were
on
the
there
said
ruby
the
old
ogre
ca
be
dead
there
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
and
oh
just
look
mavis
what
a
big
fire
he
must
have
do
you
see
the
red
of
it
in
the
window
no
said
mavis
it
the
sun
setting
look
out
to
sea
is
it
splendid
but
ruby
had
set
her
heart
upon
exploring
the
fisherman
hut
she
began
scrambling
up
the
stones
for
there
was
really
nothing
worthy
of
the
name
of
a
pathway
quite
regardless
of
the
beautiful
sight
behind
her
and
as
usual
mavis
had
to
follow
though
reluctantly
still
she
was
not
quite
without
curiosity
about
the
lonely
cottage
herself
suddenly
when
within
a
short
distance
of
the
hut
ruby
stopped
short
and
glancing
back
towards
her
sister
lifted
her
hand
as
if
to
tell
her
to
be
silent
and
listen
then
mavis
became
conscious
of
the
sound
of
voices
speaking
not
old
adam
voice
certainly
for
these
sounded
soft
and
clear
and
now
and
then
came
a
ripple
of
silvery
laughter
very
sweet
and
very
delicate
the
little
girls
who
had
drawn
near
together
looked
at
each
other
who
can
it
be
said
mavis
in
a
whisper
the
mermaids
replied
ruby
mockingly
perhaps
old
adam
has
invited
them
to
tea
but
as
she
spoke
there
came
distinctly
the
sound
of
the
words
and
then
there
was
silence
somehow
both
children
felt
rather
frightened
suppose
old
really
dead
said
ruby
looking
rather
pale
and
that
these
are
fairies
or
i
do
know
what
come
to
fetch
him
angels
said
mavis
joan
says
he
good
but
ruby
i
think
angels
would
laugh
she
had
scarcely
said
the
words
when
they
saw
running
down
the
rough
slope
from
the
hut
the
figure
of
a
boy
he
ran
fast
and
lightly
his
feet
scarcely
seeming
to
touch
the
stones
he
was
slight
and
very
it
was
pretty
to
watch
him
running
even
though
as
he
came
close
it
was
plain
that
he
was
only
a
simple
in
rough
clothes
barefoot
and
sunburnt
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
as
he
came
near
the
children
then
glancing
at
them
with
a
smile
he
lifted
his
dark
blue
cap
and
stopped
short
can
i
he
began
then
hesitated
he
had
a
pleasant
face
and
clear
grey
eyes
which
looked
one
straight
in
the
face
with
interest
and
inquiry
what
do
you
say
asked
ruby
rather
haughtily
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
lost
your
way
he
answered
quietly
there
not
many
gentry
comes
round
here
and
then
he
smiled
for
no
very
particular
reason
apparently
though
his
smile
nevertheless
gave
one
the
feeling
that
he
had
a
reason
if
he
chose
to
give
it
no
we
have
lost
our
way
said
ruby
we
came
here
on
purpose
do
you
know
the
old
man
who
lives
up
there
and
she
pointed
to
the
hut
is
it
true
that
there
something
queer
about
him
the
boy
looked
at
her
still
smiling
queer
he
repeated
ruby
began
to
feel
annoyed
she
tapped
her
foot
impatiently
yes
she
said
why
do
you
repeat
my
words
and
why
you
say
or
lady
lots
of
the
people
here
call
me
lady
do
you
know
who
i
am
the
boy
face
had
grown
graver
yes
he
said
you
are
the
little
ladies
from
the
castle
i
have
seen
you
sometimes
i
have
seen
you
in
church
we
always
call
you
the
little
ladies
grandfather
and
i
when
we
are
talking
he
has
told
me
about
you
and
i
heard
about
the
castle
though
i
never
been
in
it
it
very
fine
i
like
to
look
up
at
it
from
the
sea
ruby
felt
a
little
smoothed
down
her
tone
became
more
gracious
mavis
who
had
drawn
near
stood
listening
with
great
interest
and
as
the
boy
turned
towards
her
the
smile
came
over
his
face
again
who
do
you
mean
by
asked
ruby
eagerly
is
it
old
adam
i
did
know
he
had
any
children
or
grandchildren
yes
the
boy
replied
i
his
grandson
was
it
grandfather
you
meant
when
you
said
he
was
queer
oh
said
mavis
ruby
did
mean
to
be
rude
it
was
only
nonsense
people
say
they
say
he
very
queer
indeed
said
ruby
who
had
no
intention
of
deserting
her
colours
they
say
he
a
kind
of
a
wizard
or
an
ogre
and
that
you
hear
all
sorts
of
sounds
music
and
talking
and
i
know
all
what
if
you
near
his
cottage
in
the
evening
and
that
there
are
lights
to
be
seen
in
it
too
not
common
lights
like
candles
but
much
more
some
say
he
friends
with
the
mermaids
and
that
they
come
to
see
him
is
that
true
and
notwithstanding
her
boasted
boldness
ruby
dropped
her
voice
a
little
and
glanced
over
her
shoulder
half
nervously
seawards
as
if
not
quite
sure
but
that
some
of
the
tailed
ladies
in
question
might
be
listening
to
her
the
boy
did
more
than
smile
now
he
laughed
outright
but
his
laugh
though
bright
and
ringing
was
not
the
laugh
the
sisters
had
heard
from
the
cottage
the
mermaids
he
said
no
indeed
poor
little
things
they
never
visit
grandfather
well
why
do
you
laugh
said
ruby
angrily
again
you
speak
as
if
there
mermaids
i
was
thinking
of
stories
i
have
heard
about
them
said
the
boy
simply
but
i
could
help
laughing
to
think
of
them
coming
to
see
grandfather
how
could
they
ever
get
up
these
stones
oh
i
do
know
i
sure
ruby
answered
impatiently
if
he
a
wizard
he
could
do
anything
like
that
i
wish
you
tell
us
all
about
him
you
must
know
as
you
live
with
him
i
not
been
long
with
him
said
the
boy
he
be
friends
with
the
mermaids
for
all
i
know
he
friends
with
everybody
you
mocking
at
me
said
ruby
and
i
wo
have
it
i
sure
you
could
tell
me
things
if
you
chose
we
did
hear
talking
and
laughing
said
mavis
gently
speaking
almost
for
the
first
time
and
it
seemed
as
if
there
was
some
one
else
there
the
boy
looked
at
her
again
and
a
very
pleasant
light
came
into
his
eyes
more
than
that
indeed
as
mavis
watched
him
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
changed
in
colour
was
it
the
reflection
from
the
sky
no
there
was
a
mingling
of
every
hue
to
be
seen
over
by
the
western
horizon
certainly
but
scarcely
the
deep
clear
midsummer
they
suddenly
became
what
funny
eyes
you
got
exclaimed
the
child
impulsively
quite
blue
now
and
they
were
a
minute
ago
ruby
stared
at
him
and
then
at
mavis
nonsense
she
said
not
they
just
common
coloured
eyes
you
should
say
such
things
mavis
people
will
think
you
out
of
your
mind
mavis
looked
very
ashamed
but
the
boy
face
flushed
up
he
looked
both
glad
and
excited
if
you
please
miss
he
said
some
people
see
things
that
others
do
i
do
even
mind
that
nonsense
about
gran
and
the
mermaids
those
that
say
it
do
know
any
better
ruby
looked
at
him
sharply
then
there
is
something
to
know
she
said
now
you
might
as
well
tell
us
all
about
it
is
old
adam
a
wizard
that
he
not
answered
the
boy
stoutly
if
so
be
as
i
take
it
that
a
wizard
means
one
that
has
to
do
with
bad
spirits
unkind
and
and
unloving
call
them
what
you
will
none
of
such
like
would
come
near
gran
or
if
they
did
he
soon
send
them
to
the
i
like
you
to
see
him
for
yourself
some
day
but
not
if
you
excuse
it
he
very
tired
i
was
running
down
to
the
shore
to
fetch
a
pailful
of
sea
water
to
bathe
his
lame
arm
then
we
must
keep
you
said
mavis
but
might
we
really
come
to
see
your
grandfather
some
day
do
you
think
i
ask
him
said
the
boy
and
i
think
he
be
pleased
to
see
you
you
might
come
up
to
the
castle
if
there
anything
he
would
like
a
little
soup
or
anything
said
ruby
in
her
patronising
way
i
speak
to
the
housekeeper
thank
you
miss
said
the
boy
but
more
hesitatingly
than
he
had
spoken
before
what
your
name
asked
ruby
we
better
know
it
so
that
you
can
say
who
you
are
when
you
come
winfried
he
answered
simply
then
winfried
said
ruby
come
on
mavis
and
she
turned
to
pursue
her
way
home
past
the
cottage
winfried
hesitated
then
he
ran
a
step
or
two
after
them
i
can
show
you
a
nearer
way
home
to
the
castle
he
said
and
if
you
do
mind
it
would
be
very
kind
of
you
not
to
go
near
by
our
cottage
grandfather
is
feeble
still
did
you
know
he
had
been
very
ill
and
seeing
or
hearing
strangers
might
startle
him
then
you
come
with
us
said
ruby
you
can
tell
him
who
we
are
i
in
a
hurry
to
get
the
salt
water
said
the
boy
i
have
put
off
time
already
and
if
you
wo
think
me
rude
i
much
rather
you
came
to
the
cottage
some
day
when
we
could
invite
you
to
step
in
his
manner
was
so
simple
and
hearty
that
ruby
could
not
take
offence
though
she
had
been
quite
ready
to
do
so
very
well
she
said
then
show
us
your
nearer
way
he
led
them
without
speaking
some
little
distance
towards
the
shore
again
after
all
there
was
a
path
not
a
bad
one
of
its
kind
for
here
and
there
it
ran
on
quite
smoothly
for
a
few
yards
and
then
descended
by
stones
arranged
so
as
to
make
a
few
rough
steps
dear
me
said
ruby
how
stupid
we
were
not
to
find
this
path
before
winfried
smiled
i
scarce
think
you
could
have
found
it
without
me
to
show
you
he
said
nor
the
short
way
home
either
for
that
matter
see
here
and
having
come
to
the
end
of
the
path
he
went
on
a
few
steps
along
the
pebbly
shore
for
here
there
was
no
smooth
sand
and
stopped
before
a
great
boulder
stone
as
large
as
a
which
stood
out
suddenly
among
the
broken
rocks
winfried
stepped
up
close
to
it
and
touched
it
apparently
quite
gently
to
the
children
amazement
it
swung
round
lightly
as
if
it
had
been
the
most
perfectly
hung
door
and
there
before
them
was
revealed
a
little
roadway
wide
enough
for
two
to
walk
abreast
which
seemed
to
wind
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
as
far
as
they
could
see
it
was
like
a
carefully
rolled
gravel
path
in
a
garden
except
that
it
seemed
to
be
of
a
peculiar
kind
of
sand
white
and
glistening
ruby
darted
forward
what
a
lovely
path
she
exclaimed
will
it
take
us
straight
home
are
you
sure
it
will
quite
sure
said
winfried
you
will
see
your
way
in
no
time
if
you
run
what
a
funny
idea
laughed
the
child
and
mavis
too
looked
pleased
i
quite
sure
it
a
fairy
road
she
was
beginning
to
say
but
looking
round
their
little
guide
had
disappeared
then
came
his
voice
he
said
cheerfully
i
the
stone
door
and
up
on
the
top
of
it
little
ladies
run
home
the
girls
looked
at
each
other
upon
my
word
exclaimed
ruby
not
quite
knowing
what
to
say
if
old
adam
is
a
wizard
his
grandson
is
i
think
we
better
get
out
of
this
as
quick
as
we
can
mavis
she
seemed
half
frightened
and
half
provoked
mavis
on
the
contrary
was
quite
simply
delighted
i
should
wonder
if
this
was
the
mermaid
own
way
to
the
cottage
she
said
i
sure
old
adam
and
winfried
are
wizards
but
i
do
think
they
must
be
some
kind
of
good
fairies
or
at
least
they
must
have
to
do
with
fairies
come
along
ruby
and
she
held
out
her
own
hand
but
ruby
by
this
time
had
grown
cross
i
wo
give
in
to
such
rubbish
she
said
i
do
want
to
go
along
like
two
silly
babies
if
it
was
worth
the
trouble
climb
up
to
the
top
of
the
stone
and
go
home
the
proper
way
this
was
all
boasting
she
knew
quite
well
she
could
not
possibly
climb
up
the
stone
but
she
walked
on
a
few
steps
in
sulky
dignity
suddenly
she
gave
a
little
cry
slipped
and
fell
oh
i
hurt
my
ankle
she
exclaimed
this
horrid
white
gravel
is
so
slippery
mavis
was
beside
her
almost
before
she
had
said
the
words
and
with
her
sister
help
ruby
got
on
to
her
feet
again
though
looking
rather
doleful
i
believe
it
all
a
trick
of
that
horrid
boy
she
said
i
wish
you
had
made
me
come
to
see
that
dirty
old
cottage
mavis
mavis
stared
make
you
come
ruby
she
said
why
it
was
yourself
well
you
did
stop
it
any
way
said
ruby
and
you
seem
to
have
taken
such
a
fancy
to
that
boy
and
his
grandfather
and
ruby
we
must
go
home
said
mavis
try
if
you
can
get
along
they
were
there
was
no
help
for
it
now
ruby
tried
to
walk
to
her
surprise
her
ankle
scarcely
hurt
her
and
after
a
moment
or
two
she
even
began
urging
mavis
to
go
faster
i
believe
i
could
run
she
said
perhaps
the
bone
in
my
ankle
got
out
of
its
place
and
now
has
got
into
it
again
come
on
mavis
they
started
running
together
for
in
spite
of
her
boasting
ruby
had
had
a
lesson
and
would
not
let
go
of
mavis
they
got
on
famously
the
ground
seemed
elastic
as
they
ran
each
step
grew
at
once
firmer
and
yet
lighter
it
is
a
bit
slippery
now
is
it
said
mavis
glowing
with
the
pleasant
exercise
and
oh
ruby
do
look
up
at
the
sky
is
it
lovely
and
is
that
the
evening
star
coming
out
that
blue
light
up
there
no
it
too
early
see
no
it
gone
what
could
it
be
why
here
we
are
at
the
gate
of
the
low
terrace
they
had
suddenly
as
they
ran
come
out
from
the
path
walled
in
as
it
were
among
the
broken
rocky
fragments
on
to
a
more
open
space
which
at
the
first
moment
they
scarcely
recognised
as
one
of
the
fields
at
the
south
side
of
the
castle
ruby
too
gazed
about
her
with
surprise
it
a
quick
way
home
certainly
she
allowed
but
i
do
see
any
star
or
blue
light
mavis
it
must
be
your
fancy
mavis
looked
up
at
the
sky
the
sunset
colours
were
just
beginning
to
fade
a
soft
pearly
grey
veil
was
slowly
drawing
over
them
though
they
were
still
brilliant
mavis
seemed
perplexed
it
is
gone
she
said
but
i
did
see
it
it
must
have
been
the
dazzle
of
the
light
in
your
eyes
said
ruby
i
am
seeing
lots
of
little
suns
all
over
red
ones
and
yellow
ones
no
it
was
like
that
said
mavis
it
was
more
like
more
like
what
asked
ruby
i
was
going
to
say
more
like
a
up
in
the
sky
said
her
sister
you
girl
laughed
ruby
i
never
did
hear
any
one
talk
such
nonsense
as
you
do
i
tell
cousin
hortensia
see
if
i
do
i
do
mind
said
mavis
quietly
chapter
three
the
princess
with
the
eyes
for
just
when
it
thrills
me
most
the
fairies
change
into
phantoms
cold
and
the
beautiful
dream
is
lost
miss
hortensia
was
looking
out
for
the
little
girls
as
they
slowly
came
up
the
terraces
there
you
are
at
last
she
called
out
you
are
rather
late
my
dears
i
have
been
round
at
the
other
side
thinking
i
saw
you
go
out
that
way
so
we
did
said
ruby
we
went
down
to
the
cove
and
along
the
shore
as
far
as
oh
cousin
hortensia
we
have
had
adventures
and
last
of
all
what
you
think
mavis
has
just
seen
a
up
in
the
sky
miss
hortensia
smiled
at
mavis
she
had
a
particular
way
of
smiling
at
her
as
if
she
was
not
perfectly
sure
if
the
little
girl
were
quite
like
other
people
but
mavis
though
she
understood
this
far
better
than
her
cousin
imagined
never
felt
angry
at
it
a
in
the
sky
said
the
lady
that
is
an
odd
idea
but
you
must
tell
me
all
your
adventures
when
we
are
comfortably
settled
for
the
evening
run
in
and
take
your
things
off
quickly
for
i
do
want
you
to
catch
cold
and
the
air
now
the
sun
is
set
is
chilly
there
is
a
splendid
fire
burning
and
we
shall
have
tea
in
my
room
as
i
promised
you
oh
how
nice
said
ruby
come
along
mavis
i
as
hungry
as
a
hawk
and
you
tell
us
stories
after
tea
cousin
hortensia
wo
you
said
mavis
at
least
you
tell
us
about
your
queer
dream
and
about
mamma
going
to
court
added
ruby
as
she
dashed
upstairs
for
by
this
time
they
were
inside
the
house
the
part
of
the
castle
that
the
children
and
their
cousin
and
the
few
servants
in
attendance
on
them
occupied
was
really
only
a
corner
of
it
a
short
flight
of
stairs
led
up
to
a
small
gallery
running
round
a
and
out
of
this
gallery
opened
their
and
what
had
been
their
nursery
and
the
and
miss
hortensia
own
were
on
the
to
get
to
any
of
the
turrets
was
quite
a
long
journey
they
were
approached
by
the
great
staircase
which
ascended
from
the
large
white
and
black
tiled
hall
dividing
after
the
first
flight
into
two
branches
each
of
which
led
to
passages
from
which
other
smaller
stairs
went
upwards
to
the
top
of
the
house
the
grandest
rooms
opened
out
of
the
tiled
hall
on
the
and
out
of
the
passages
on
the
first
floor
from
this
central
part
of
the
house
the
children
corner
was
shut
off
by
heavy
swing
doors
seldom
opened
so
when
ruby
and
mavis
visited
the
turrets
they
had
to
pass
through
these
doors
and
go
some
way
along
the
passages
and
then
up
one
of
the
side
stairs
up
up
up
the
flights
of
steps
getting
steeper
and
narrower
as
they
climbed
till
at
last
they
reached
the
door
of
the
itself
of
these
chambers
there
were
two
one
in
each
turret
east
and
west
the
west
was
their
favourite
partly
because
from
it
they
saw
the
sunset
and
partly
because
it
was
nearer
their
own
rooms
they
had
been
allowed
to
make
a
sort
of
private
nest
of
it
for
themselves
and
to
play
there
on
rainy
days
when
they
could
not
get
out
and
sometimes
in
very
cold
or
snowy
weather
they
had
a
fire
there
which
made
the
queer
old
room
very
cheery
there
were
three
windows
in
each
turret
and
they
were
furnished
in
an
odd
irregular
way
with
all
sorts
of
quaint
furniture
discarded
from
other
parts
of
the
castle
in
former
days
these
had
sometimes
been
used
as
when
the
house
was
very
full
of
visitors
for
the
large
modern
rooms
and
the
hall
i
have
spoken
of
had
been
added
by
the
children
grandfather
a
very
hospitable
but
extravagant
man
and
before
he
made
these
improvements
there
were
often
more
guests
than
it
was
easy
to
find
room
for
ruby
and
mavis
were
not
long
in
taking
off
their
things
and
tidying
themselves
for
their
evening
in
miss
hortensia
pleasant
little
room
they
made
a
pretty
picture
as
they
ran
downstairs
their
fair
curls
dancing
on
their
shoulders
though
if
i
were
to
describe
to
you
how
they
were
dressed
i
am
afraid
you
would
think
they
must
have
been
a
very
looking
little
pair
here
we
are
cousin
hortensia
exclaimed
ruby
as
they
came
in
and
i
do
hope
it
nearly
not
quite
my
dear
miss
hortensia
replied
glancing
at
a
beautifully
carved
swiss
clock
which
stood
on
the
mantelpiece
the
little
trumpeter
wo
tell
us
it
six
for
half
an
hour
yet
his
dog
has
just
barked
twice
lazy
things
said
ruby
shrugging
her
shoulders
i
like
to
shake
that
old
trumpeter
sometimes
and
sometimes
you
like
to
pat
him
to
sleep
would
you
said
mavis
when
cousin
hortensia
telling
us
stories
and
he
says
miss
hortensia
looked
at
mavis
in
some
surprise
but
she
seemed
very
pleased
too
it
was
not
often
mavis
spoke
so
brightly
suppose
you
use
up
the
in
telling
stories
said
their
cousin
mine
will
keep
till
after
tea
what
were
all
the
adventures
you
met
with
oh
said
ruby
it
was
too
queer
did
you
know
cousin
that
there
was
a
short
way
home
from
the
near
old
adam
cottage
a
queer
way
and
she
went
on
to
describe
the
path
between
the
rocks
miss
hortensia
looked
very
puzzled
who
showed
it
to
you
she
said
for
ruby
in
her
way
had
begun
at
the
end
of
the
story
without
speaking
of
the
boy
winfried
or
explaining
why
they
or
she
had
been
so
curious
about
the
old
man
whom
the
villagers
called
a
wizard
it
was
the
boy
mavis
replied
such
a
nice
boy
cousin
hortensia
with
funny
bluey
eyes
at
least
they
blue
oh
mavis
do
not
talk
so
sillily
said
ruby
his
eyes
are
a
bit
blue
she
got
blue
on
the
brain
cousin
she
really
has
seeing
in
the
sky
too
i
do
think
he
a
particularly
nice
boy
he
was
rather
cool
i
sure
we
would
have
done
his
grandfather
any
harm
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
cousin
old
adam
they
call
him
and
then
she
went
on
to
give
a
rather
more
clear
account
of
their
walk
and
all
they
had
seen
and
heard
miss
hortensia
listened
attentively
and
into
her
own
eyes
crept
a
dreamy
or
rather
look
it
is
odd
she
said
i
have
a
kind
of
fancy
that
i
have
heard
of
the
old
for
he
must
be
almost
a
hermit
before
but
somehow
i
do
think
it
was
here
i
wonder
how
long
he
has
lived
here
i
do
know
said
ruby
a
good
while
i
should
think
he
was
here
when
joan
was
our
nurse
but
that
was
only
two
years
ago
said
miss
hortensia
smiling
if
he
had
been
here
many
years
the
people
would
not
count
him
so
much
of
a
foreigner
and
the
boy
you
met
has
he
come
to
take
care
of
the
old
man
i
suppose
so
we
did
ask
him
said
ruby
carelessly
he
was
really
such
a
cool
boy
ordering
us
not
to
go
near
the
cottage
indeed
i
told
him
he
might
come
up
to
get
some
soup
or
jelly
for
his
grandfather
she
went
on
with
a
toss
of
her
head
i
said
it
you
know
just
to
put
him
in
his
place
and
remind
him
whom
he
was
speaking
to
i
sure
he
did
mean
to
be
rude
said
mavis
and
cousin
there
really
was
something
rather
about
him
is
it
queer
we
never
heard
of
that
path
before
yes
miss
hortensia
replied
are
you
sure
you
did
both
fall
asleep
on
the
shore
and
dream
it
all
though
to
be
sure
it
is
rather
too
cold
weather
for
you
to
have
been
overcome
by
drowsiness
and
we
could
both
have
dreamt
the
same
thing
if
we
had
fallen
asleep
said
mavis
in
her
practical
way
it
was
like
when
you
were
a
little
girl
and
saw
or
dreamt
do
you
begin
telling
the
story
if
cousin
hortensia
going
to
tell
it
herself
interrupted
ruby
i
was
just
thinking
i
had
forgotten
it
a
good
deal
and
that
it
would
seem
fresh
but
here
tea
at
last
i
am
so
glad
they
were
very
merry
and
happy
during
the
meal
ruby
was
particularly
pleased
with
herself
having
a
vague
idea
that
she
had
behaved
in
a
very
grand
and
dignified
way
mavis
eyes
were
very
bright
the
afternoon
adventure
had
left
on
her
a
feeling
of
expecting
something
pleasant
that
she
could
hardly
put
in
words
and
besides
this
there
was
cousin
hortensia
story
to
hear
when
the
table
was
cleared
cousin
hortensia
settled
herself
with
her
knitting
in
a
low
chair
by
the
fire
and
told
the
children
to
bring
forward
two
little
stools
and
seat
themselves
beside
her
they
had
their
knitting
too
for
this
useful
art
had
been
taught
them
while
they
were
so
young
that
they
could
scarcely
remember
having
learnt
it
and
the
three
pairs
of
needles
made
a
soft
which
did
not
the
least
disturb
their
owners
so
used
were
they
to
it
rather
did
it
seem
a
pleasant
accompaniment
to
miss
hortensia
voice
you
want
me
to
tell
you
the
story
of
my
night
in
the
west
when
i
was
a
little
girl
she
began
you
have
heard
it
before
partly
at
least
but
i
will
try
to
tell
it
more
fully
this
time
i
was
a
very
little
girl
younger
than
you
two
i
do
think
i
was
more
than
eight
years
old
i
had
come
here
with
my
father
and
mother
and
elder
sisters
to
join
a
merry
party
assembled
to
celebrate
the
silver
wedding
of
your
your
grandfather
himself
their
eldest
child
was
about
three
and
twenty
he
was
not
then
married
so
it
was
some
time
before
your
father
was
born
i
do
quite
know
why
they
had
brought
me
it
seems
to
me
i
would
have
been
better
at
home
in
my
nursery
for
there
were
no
children
as
young
as
i
to
keep
me
company
perhaps
it
was
that
they
wished
to
have
me
to
represent
another
generation
as
it
were
though
after
all
that
might
have
been
done
by
my
sisters
the
elder
of
them
jacintha
was
then
nineteen
it
was
she
who
afterwards
married
your
grandfather
so
that
besides
being
cousins
of
the
family
as
we
were
already
i
am
your
grandmother
sister
and
thus
your
as
well
as
cousin
the
little
girls
nodded
their
heads
i
was
so
much
younger
than
jacintha
miss
hortensia
went
on
that
your
father
never
called
me
aunt
he
and
i
have
always
been
robert
and
hortensia
to
each
other
and
to
me
he
has
always
been
like
a
younger
brother
but
about
your
adventure
said
ruby
who
was
not
of
a
sentimental
turn
i
am
coming
to
it
said
their
cousin
well
as
i
said
the
party
was
a
merry
one
they
had
dancing
and
music
in
plenty
every
evening
and
the
house
which
was
in
some
ways
smaller
than
it
is
now
was
very
full
there
were
a
great
many
bedrooms
though
few
of
them
were
large
and
i
and
my
sisters
being
relations
were
treated
with
rather
less
ceremony
than
some
of
the
stranger
guests
and
put
to
sleep
in
the
i
had
a
little
bed
in
one
corner
and
my
sisters
slept
together
in
the
same
old
which
is
still
there
i
used
to
be
put
to
bed
much
earlier
than
they
came
for
as
i
said
there
were
dancing
and
other
amusements
most
evenings
till
pretty
late
i
was
not
at
all
a
nervous
or
frightened
child
and
even
sometimes
when
i
lay
up
there
by
myself
wide
awake
for
the
change
and
the
excitement
kept
me
from
going
to
sleep
as
quickly
as
at
home
i
did
not
feel
at
all
lonely
from
my
bed
i
could
see
out
of
the
window
for
the
turret
windows
are
so
high
up
that
it
has
never
been
necessary
to
have
blinds
on
them
and
i
loved
to
lie
there
watching
the
starlit
sky
or
sometimes
when
the
moon
was
bright
and
full
gazing
up
at
the
clouds
that
went
scurrying
over
her
face
one
night
i
had
been
unusually
wakeful
i
lay
there
hearing
now
and
then
very
very
faint
sounds
of
the
music
down
below
it
was
a
mild
night
and
i
think
the
windows
were
a
little
open
at
last
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
when
i
awoke
or
rather
when
i
i
awoke
the
room
was
all
in
darkness
except
in
one
corner
the
corner
by
the
west
window
there
there
was
a
soft
steady
light
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
on
purpose
to
make
me
look
that
way
for
there
sitting
on
the
old
chair
that
still
stands
in
the
depth
of
that
window
was
some
one
i
had
never
seen
before
a
lady
in
a
cloudy
silvery
dress
with
a
sheen
of
blue
over
it
my
waking
or
looking
at
her
for
though
it
must
all
have
been
a
dream
i
could
not
make
you
understand
it
unless
i
described
it
as
if
it
were
real
seemed
to
be
made
conscious
to
her
for
she
at
once
turned
her
eyes
upon
me
then
rose
slowly
and
came
over
the
room
towards
me
were
you
frightened
said
ruby
breathlessly
in
spite
of
her
boasted
disbelief
in
dreams
and
visions
her
cousin
story
had
caught
her
attention
miss
hortensia
shook
her
head
not
in
the
least
she
said
on
the
contrary
i
felt
a
strange
and
delightful
kind
of
pleasure
and
wonder
it
was
more
intense
than
i
have
ever
felt
anything
of
the
kind
in
waking
life
indeed
if
it
had
lasted
long
i
think
it
would
have
been
more
than
i
could
bear
miss
hortensia
stopped
for
a
moment
and
leant
back
in
her
chair
i
have
felt
of
the
same
she
went
on
when
listening
to
very
beautiful
music
music
that
seemed
too
beautiful
and
made
you
almost
cry
out
for
it
to
stop
i
never
heard
music
like
that
whispered
little
mavis
but
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
or
continued
miss
hortensia
sometimes
on
a
marvellously
beautiful
day
what
people
call
a
day
i
have
had
a
feeling
rather
like
it
a
feeling
that
makes
one
shut
one
eyes
for
very
pleasure
well
said
ruby
did
you
shut
your
eyes
then
or
what
did
you
do
no
said
her
cousin
i
could
not
have
shut
them
i
felt
she
was
looking
at
me
and
her
eyes
seemed
to
catch
and
fasten
mine
and
draw
them
into
hers
it
was
her
eyes
above
all
that
filled
me
with
that
beautiful
wonderful
feeling
i
can
never
forget
it
never
i
could
fancy
sometimes
even
now
old
woman
as
i
am
that
i
am
again
the
little
enraptured
child
gazing
up
at
the
beautiful
vision
i
feel
her
eyes
in
mine
still
how
funny
you
are
interrupted
ruby
a
minute
ago
you
said
she
pulled
your
eyes
into
hers
now
you
say
hers
came
into
yours
it
would
be
a
very
funny
feeling
whichever
it
was
i
do
think
i
should
like
it
miss
hortensia
glanced
at
her
but
gravely
she
did
not
smile
it
must
be
a
very
feeling
as
you
call
it
to
a
hitherto
blind
man
the
first
time
he
sees
the
sunshine
i
daresay
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
describe
and
to
a
still
blind
person
it
would
be
impossible
to
explain
it
i
daresay
the
man
would
not
feel
sure
whether
the
sun
had
come
into
his
eyes
or
his
eyes
had
reached
up
to
the
sun
ruby
fidgeted
oh
do
go
on
about
the
fairy
or
whatever
she
was
she
said
never
mind
about
what
i
said
miss
hortensia
smiled
the
lady
came
slowly
across
the
room
to
me
she
went
on
and
stood
by
my
bed
looking
down
at
me
with
those
wonderful
blue
eyes
then
she
smiled
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
light
about
her
grew
still
brighter
i
thought
i
sat
up
in
bed
to
see
her
better
you
a
fairy
i
said
at
last
she
smiled
still
more
you
like
you
may
call
me
a
fairy
she
answered
if
i
am
a
fairy
my
home
must
be
fairyland
and
this
is
one
of
my
homes
so
you
are
my
guest
my
little
girl
i
did
not
mind
her
saying
that
i
smiled
too
never
seen
you
here
before
i
said
and
she
laughed
a
little
i
never
heard
anything
so
pretty
as
her
laugh
she
replied
i
have
seen
you
and
every
one
that
has
ever
been
here
though
every
one
has
not
seen
me
now
listen
my
child
i
wanted
you
to
see
me
because
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
there
will
come
a
time
when
you
will
be
drawn
two
ways
one
will
be
back
here
to
the
old
castle
by
the
sea
after
many
years
many
many
years
as
you
count
things
choose
that
way
for
you
will
be
wanted
here
those
yet
unborn
will
want
you
for
they
will
want
love
and
care
look
into
my
eyes
little
girl
and
promise
me
you
will
come
to
them
and
in
my
dream
i
thought
i
gazed
again
into
her
eyes
and
i
felt
as
if
their
blue
light
was
the
light
of
a
faith
and
truth
that
could
not
be
broken
and
i
said
promise
and
then
the
fairy
lady
seemed
to
draw
a
gauze
veil
over
her
face
and
it
grew
dim
and
the
wonderful
eyes
were
hidden
and
i
thought
i
fell
asleep
in
reality
i
suppose
i
had
never
been
awake
and
when
you
did
wake
up
it
was
morning
i
suppose
and
it
had
all
been
a
dream
asked
ruby
miss
hortensia
gave
a
little
sigh
yes
she
said
i
suppose
it
had
been
a
dream
it
was
morning
bright
morning
the
sun
streaming
in
at
the
other
window
when
i
awoke
and
i
never
saw
the
fairy
lady
again
not
even
in
a
dream
but
what
she
had
said
came
true
my
dears
many
many
years
after
when
i
was
already
beginning
to
be
an
old
woman
it
came
true
i
am
afraid
i
had
grown
selfish
life
had
brought
me
many
anxieties
and
i
had
lived
in
a
great
city
where
there
was
much
luxury
and
gaiety
and
where
no
one
seemed
to
have
thought
for
anything
but
the
rush
of
pleasure
and
worldly
cares
i
had
forgotten
all
about
my
beautiful
vision
when
one
day
there
came
a
summons
your
sweet
young
mother
had
died
my
darlings
and
your
poor
father
in
his
desolation
could
think
of
no
one
better
to
come
and
take
care
of
his
little
girls
you
were
only
two
years
old
than
his
old
cousin
and
so
i
came
and
then
there
crept
back
to
me
the
remembrance
of
my
dream
i
had
indeed
been
drawn
two
ways
for
the
friends
i
might
have
gone
to
live
with
were
rich
and
and
they
promised
me
everything
i
could
wish
but
i
thought
of
the
two
little
motherless
ones
here
in
the
old
castle
by
the
sea
in
want
of
love
and
care
as
had
said
and
i
came
miss
hortensia
stopped
even
ruby
was
impressed
by
what
she
had
heard
dear
cousin
she
said
it
was
very
good
of
you
and
have
you
never
seen
the
beautiful
lady
again
said
mavis
she
told
you
the
west
turret
was
her
own
room
did
she
have
you
never
seen
her
there
miss
hortensia
shook
her
head
you
forget
dear
it
was
only
a
dream
and
even
if
it
had
been
more
than
that
we
grow
very
far
away
from
angels
and
fairies
as
we
get
old
i
fear
not
mavis
said
you
not
like
that
and
the
lady
must
have
been
so
pleased
with
you
for
caring
for
us
i
wonder
she
has
ever
come
to
see
you
again
do
you
know
she
went
on
eagerly
after
a
moment
pause
i
have
a
feeling
that
she
in
the
west
sometimes
miss
hortensia
looked
at
the
child
in
amazement
mavis
quiet
rather
dull
face
seemed
transformed
it
was
all
flushed
and
beaming
her
eyes
sparkling
and
bright
mavis
she
said
you
look
as
if
you
had
seen
her
yourself
but
it
was
only
a
dream
you
must
let
my
stories
make
you
fanciful
i
am
too
fanciful
myself
perhaps
i
have
always
loved
the
vest
turret
and
that
was
why
i
chose
it
for
your
when
you
were
little
dots
i
so
glad
you
did
said
mavis
drawing
a
long
breath
after
that
they
were
all
rather
silent
for
a
while
then
ruby
claimed
miss
hortensia
promise
of
the
story
or
description
rather
of
the
grand
court
ball
at
which
her
mother
beauty
had
made
such
a
sensation
and
when
that
was
ended
the
little
trumpeter
announced
much
to
the
children
displeasure
that
it
was
time
to
go
to
bed
we
had
a
cosy
evening
said
mavis
as
she
kissed
miss
hortensia
and
oh
ruby
she
said
as
her
sister
and
she
were
going
slowly
upstairs
you
wish
we
might
sleep
in
the
no
indeed
ruby
replied
in
a
most
decided
tone
i
certainly
do
chapter
four
a
boy
and
a
boat
are
little
boats
alive
and
can
they
plan
and
feel
a
if
you
please
there
a
boy
at
the
asking
for
the
young
ladies
said
the
young
ulrica
who
generally
waited
on
ruby
and
mavis
they
were
just
finishing
their
morning
lessons
with
miss
hortensia
and
mavis
was
putting
away
the
books
a
task
which
usually
fell
to
her
share
miss
hortensia
gave
a
little
start
a
boy
she
exclaimed
what
kind
of
a
boy
it
ca
be
oh
no
of
course
not
how
foolish
i
am
at
the
did
you
say
ulrica
who
is
it
oh
i
know
cried
ruby
jumping
up
with
a
clatter
delighted
to
avoid
finding
out
the
mistake
in
a
sum
which
miss
hortensia
had
told
her
she
must
correct
it
winfried
i
sure
it
is
he
come
for
some
soup
or
something
i
told
him
he
might
but
i
do
think
it
rather
greedy
to
have
come
the
very
next
day
may
i
go
and
speak
to
him
cousin
well
yes
i
suppose
so
no
i
think
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
come
in
here
show
the
boy
in
here
ulrica
at
least
ask
him
if
he
is
old
adam
grandson
in
a
minute
or
two
the
door
was
again
opened
if
you
please
said
ulrica
voice
as
before
it
it
the
boy
the
boy
walked
in
he
held
his
cap
in
his
hand
and
made
a
sort
of
graceful
though
simple
obeisance
to
the
ladies
he
did
not
seem
the
least
shy
yet
neither
was
there
a
touch
of
boldness
about
him
on
his
face
was
the
slight
but
pleasant
smile
that
had
more
than
once
lighted
it
up
the
day
before
and
his
eyes
as
he
stood
there
full
in
the
bright
gleam
of
the
window
for
it
was
a
clear
and
sunny
day
were
blue
ruby
came
forward
oh
it
you
is
it
she
said
with
the
good
humour
usual
to
her
when
not
put
out
i
thought
it
was
it
winfried
cousin
hortensia
the
boy
i
told
you
of
i
suppose
you
come
for
some
soup
for
your
grandfather
winfried
smiled
a
little
more
than
before
mavis
crept
forward
she
wished
she
could
have
said
something
but
she
was
afraid
of
vexing
ruby
no
miss
said
winfried
i
did
not
come
for
that
though
grandfather
said
it
was
very
kind
of
you
and
some
day
perhaps
he
stopped
short
i
came
to
bring
you
this
which
i
found
on
the
rocks
down
below
our
cottage
and
he
held
out
a
little
silver
cross
ruby
started
and
put
her
hand
up
to
her
neck
oh
dear
she
said
i
never
knew
i
had
lost
it
are
you
sure
it
yours
mavis
i
got
my
cord
on
yes
but
the
cross
must
have
dropped
off
said
mavis
i
have
mine
all
right
and
so
it
proved
both
little
sisters
wore
these
crosses
which
were
exactly
alike
ruby
took
hers
from
winfried
and
began
examining
it
to
see
how
it
had
got
loose
miss
hortensia
came
forward
it
was
very
good
of
you
to
bring
the
little
cross
she
said
kindly
for
something
about
the
boy
attracted
her
very
much
ruby
my
dear
she
went
on
half
reprovingly
ruby
started
and
looked
up
i
am
sure
you
are
very
much
obliged
oh
yes
of
course
i
am
said
the
little
girl
carelessly
it
certainly
was
very
sharp
of
you
to
find
it
she
added
with
more
interest
i
can
generally
find
things
said
winfried
quietly
is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
your
grandfather
asked
miss
hortensia
i
am
sorry
to
hear
he
so
the
boy
shook
his
head
a
sad
look
passed
across
his
bright
face
yes
he
said
he
pretty
bad
sometimes
but
some
days
he
much
better
he
better
there
one
thing
he
would
like
he
went
on
he
told
me
to
ask
you
if
some
day
the
young
ladies
might
come
to
see
him
he
said
i
might
ask
ruby
interrupted
why
how
funny
you
are
she
said
that
was
just
what
we
wanted
yesterday
and
you
would
let
us
go
near
the
cottage
you
said
startle
him
he
was
very
tired
yesterday
said
winfried
and
you
see
he
looking
for
you
he
was
chattering
and
laughing
all
the
same
or
somebody
was
said
ruby
we
heard
them
do
you
remember
winfried
did
not
speak
but
he
did
not
seem
vexed
i
believe
it
was
the
mermaids
after
all
ruby
went
on
cousin
hortensia
if
you
let
us
go
there
the
mermaids
will
steal
us
no
indeed
exclaimed
winfried
eagerly
miss
hortensia
smiled
at
him
i
am
not
afraid
she
said
tell
your
grandfather
the
young
ladies
shall
certainly
go
to
see
him
some
day
soon
said
mavis
speaking
almost
for
the
first
time
oh
do
say
we
may
go
it
our
very
well
said
miss
hortensia
are
you
sure
you
can
find
your
way
i
can
send
ulrica
with
you
may
i
come
to
fetch
the
young
ladies
asked
winfried
i
know
all
the
short
cuts
i
should
think
you
did
laughed
ruby
we
told
cousin
hortensia
all
about
that
queer
path
through
the
rocks
never
seen
it
either
i
take
you
quite
as
nice
a
way
said
the
boy
composedly
may
i
go
now
please
he
added
turning
to
miss
hortensia
grandfather
may
be
wanting
me
and
thank
you
very
much
and
in
another
moment
he
was
gone
miss
hortensia
was
quite
silent
for
a
minute
or
two
after
he
had
left
the
room
cousin
began
ruby
but
her
cousin
did
not
seem
to
hear
repeated
the
child
impatiently
miss
hortensia
looked
up
as
if
awakened
from
a
brown
study
did
you
speak
my
dear
she
said
yes
of
course
i
did
i
want
you
to
say
something
about
that
queer
boy
i
suppose
you
think
him
very
nice
or
you
would
let
mavis
and
me
go
to
his
cottage
you
generally
so
frightened
about
us
i
do
think
he
is
a
very
nice
boy
said
miss
hortensia
i
am
sure
he
is
quite
trustworthy
believe
he
a
bit
of
a
fairy
and
i
sure
his
old
grandfather
a
wizard
murmured
ruby
and
i
quite
expect
as
i
said
to
joan
that
we
shall
be
turned
into
or
frogs
if
we
go
there
i
should
mind
being
a
said
mavis
not
for
a
little
while
at
least
would
you
cousin
hortensia
but
miss
hortensia
had
not
been
listening
to
their
chatter
my
dears
she
said
suddenly
i
will
tell
you
one
reason
why
i
should
be
glad
for
you
sometimes
to
have
winfried
as
a
companion
if
he
is
as
good
and
manly
as
he
seems
i
have
had
a
letter
from
your
father
telling
me
of
a
new
guest
we
are
to
expect
it
is
a
cousin
of
yours
a
little
nephew
of
your
father
your
aunt
margaret
son
he
is
an
only
child
and
your
father
fears
a
good
deal
spoilt
he
is
coming
here
because
his
father
is
away
at
sea
and
his
mother
is
ill
and
must
be
kept
quiet
and
bertrand
it
seems
is
very
noisy
bertrand
repeated
ruby
oh
i
remember
about
him
i
remember
father
telling
us
about
him
he
is
a
horrid
boy
i
know
your
father
did
not
call
him
a
horrid
boy
i
sure
said
miss
hortensia
no
said
mavis
he
only
said
he
was
spoilt
and
he
said
he
was
a
pretty
little
boy
and
nice
in
some
ways
well
we
must
do
our
best
to
make
him
nicer
said
miss
hortensia
though
i
confess
i
feel
a
little
uneasy
you
have
never
been
accustomed
to
rough
bearish
ways
and
if
winfried
can
be
with
you
sometimes
he
might
help
you
with
bertrand
when
is
he
coming
asked
ruby
very
soon
but
i
do
not
know
the
exact
day
now
run
off
my
dears
there
is
time
for
you
to
have
half
an
hour
play
in
the
garden
before
dinner
it
was
curious
that
of
the
two
little
girls
mavis
seemed
the
more
to
dislike
the
idea
of
the
expected
guest
ruby
she
said
rather
dolefully
i
do
wish
bertrand
were
coming
he
spoil
everything
and
we
sha
know
what
to
do
with
him
there
not
much
to
spoil
that
i
see
said
ruby
what
do
you
mean
oh
our
nice
quiet
ways
cousin
hortensia
telling
us
stories
and
all
that
said
mavis
and
i
sure
winfried
wo
want
to
have
to
look
after
a
rough
rude
little
boy
it
quite
different
with
winfried
likes
us
because
we
ladies
you
know
and
gentle
and
nice
to
him
ruby
laughed
how
you
go
on
about
winfried
winfried
she
said
mockingly
i
think
it
a
very
good
thing
bertrand
is
coming
to
put
him
down
a
bit
a
common
i
wonder
at
cousin
hortensia
i
sure
if
father
knew
he
would
be
at
all
pleased
but
not
going
to
tell
him
i
mean
to
have
some
fun
with
master
winfried
before
i
have
done
with
him
and
i
expect
bertrand
will
help
me
ruby
exclaimed
mavis
looking
startled
you
do
mean
that
you
are
going
to
play
him
any
tricks
ruby
only
laughed
again
more
mockingly
than
before
i
like
to
lock
him
up
in
the
haunted
room
in
the
west
turret
one
night
she
said
i
do
hope
he
get
a
good
fright
mavis
seemed
to
have
recovered
from
her
alarm
i
do
believe
he
mind
the
least
scrap
she
said
that
shows
you
do
understand
him
one
bit
he
like
it
besides
you
say
yourself
you
think
he
a
fairy
boy
so
why
should
he
be
afraid
of
fairies
nobody
afraid
of
you
silly
girl
but
if
cousin
hortensia
saw
anything
in
the
turret
and
i
do
believe
she
did
it
was
a
fairy
it
was
quite
different
more
a
sort
of
witch
i
suppose
you
always
talking
of
witches
and
wizards
retorted
mavis
who
seemed
to
be
picking
up
a
spirit
which
rather
astonished
ruby
like
thinking
of
nicer
things
angels
and
oh
ruby
she
suddenly
broke
off
do
look
here
oh
how
lovely
and
stooping
down
she
pointed
to
a
thick
cluster
of
turquoise
blossoms
almost
hidden
in
a
corner
beneath
the
shrubs
they
darlings
really
it
enough
to
make
one
believe
in
fairies
or
kind
spirits
of
some
kind
to
find
like
these
in
november
and
she
looked
up
at
her
sister
with
delight
dancing
in
her
eyes
even
ruby
looked
surprised
they
are
beauties
she
said
and
i
almost
sure
they
were
there
yesterday
did
we
come
round
by
here
mavis
not
till
it
was
nearly
dark
we
ran
in
this
way
you
know
after
we
came
out
of
winfried
path
said
mavis
oh
yes
i
remember
ruby
replied
and
a
half
dreamy
look
stole
over
her
face
they
were
standing
on
the
lower
terrace
this
side
of
the
castle
as
i
have
said
was
much
more
sheltered
and
protected
than
the
other
but
still
already
in
november
it
was
bleak
and
bare
the
evergreen
shrubs
had
begun
to
look
and
important
as
i
think
they
always
do
in
late
autumn
when
their
fragile
companions
of
the
summer
are
shivering
together
in
forlorn
misery
or
sinking
slowly
and
sadly
leaf
by
leaf
brown
and
shrivelled
into
the
parent
bosom
of
mother
earth
always
ready
to
receive
and
hide
her
poor
children
in
their
day
of
desolation
nay
more
far
more
than
that
does
she
for
them
in
her
dark
but
loving
embrace
not
a
leaf
not
a
tiniest
twig
is
lost
or
mislaid
all
everything
is
cared
for
and
restored
again
at
the
sun
warm
kiss
to
creep
forth
in
ever
fresh
and
renewed
life
and
beauty
for
all
we
see
children
dear
is
but
a
type
faint
and
shadowy
of
the
real
things
that
then
a
strange
sort
of
irritation
came
over
ruby
the
soft
wondering
expression
so
new
to
her
disappeared
and
she
turned
sharply
to
mavis
rubbish
she
said
of
course
they
were
there
yesterday
but
they
sha
be
there
here
goes
and
she
bent
down
to
pick
the
little
flowers
mavis
stopped
her
with
a
cry
do
gather
them
ruby
she
said
poor
little
things
they
might
stay
in
their
corner
in
peace
and
we
could
come
and
look
at
them
every
day
they
wither
so
soon
in
the
house
ruby
laughed
she
was
much
more
careless
than
actually
unkind
at
least
when
kindness
cost
her
little
a
baby
you
are
she
said
contemptuously
you
make
as
much
fuss
as
when
i
wanted
to
take
the
thrush
eggs
last
spring
you
like
to
give
your
dear
winfried
a
posy
of
them
no
mavis
answered
he
would
like
us
to
gather
them
there
are
so
few
and
they
do
look
so
sweet
the
next
day
was
clear
and
bright
but
cold
evidently
winter
was
coming
now
but
old
bertha
had
started
the
fires
at
last
as
the
date
on
which
it
was
the
rule
at
the
castle
for
them
to
begin
on
was
now
past
so
inside
the
house
it
was
comfortable
enough
in
the
inhabited
part
of
it
at
least
though
in
the
great
unused
rooms
round
the
tiled
hall
where
all
the
furniture
was
shrouded
in
linen
covers
and
up
the
echoing
staircase
and
up
still
higher
in
the
where
the
wind
whistled
in
at
one
window
and
out
again
at
the
opposite
one
where
jack
frost
pictures
lasted
the
same
on
the
panes
for
days
at
a
time
dear
dear
it
cold
even
bertha
herself
allowed
when
she
had
to
make
her
weekly
tour
of
inspection
to
see
that
all
was
right
i
will
ask
miss
hortensia
not
to
let
the
little
ladies
play
in
the
west
turret
this
winter
thought
the
old
woman
i
sure
it
was
there
miss
mavis
caught
her
cold
last
christmas
a
good
fire
indeed
it
take
a
week
of
bonfires
to
warm
that
room
but
old
bertha
was
mistaken
as
you
will
see
there
was
no
thought
of
playing
in
the
west
turret
this
however
for
it
was
the
right
sort
of
day
for
a
bright
winter
walk
and
while
the
afternoon
was
still
young
ruby
and
mavis
warmly
wrapt
up
in
their
mantles
and
hoods
were
racing
downstairs
to
winfried
who
had
come
punctually
and
was
waiting
for
them
so
ulrica
had
come
in
to
say
at
the
door
in
the
archway
on
the
sea
side
of
the
castle
what
are
you
here
for
was
ruby
first
greeting
why
did
you
come
to
the
garden
side
are
you
going
to
take
us
by
the
path
between
the
rocks
down
below
the
field
no
miss
ruby
said
the
boy
his
cap
in
his
hand
we
going
another
way
i
think
you
will
like
it
just
as
well
we
must
go
down
to
the
cove
first
do
mind
said
ruby
dancing
on
in
front
of
the
two
others
but
i
afraid
mavis
has
been
dreaming
of
that
nice
cosy
little
path
she
would
let
me
even
look
for
the
entrance
to
it
yesterday
she
said
we
should
wait
for
you
to
show
it
us
i
think
miss
mavis
will
like
way
just
as
well
winfried
repeated
they
were
some
little
distance
down
the
cliff
by
this
time
it
was
very
clear
and
bright
for
once
the
waves
even
though
the
tide
was
close
up
to
the
shore
seemed
in
a
peaceful
mood
and
only
as
a
distant
murmur
came
the
boom
of
their
dashing
against
the
rocks
round
to
the
right
beyond
the
little
sheltered
nook
winfried
stood
still
for
a
moment
and
gazed
down
seawards
shading
his
eyes
with
his
hand
for
winter
though
it
was
the
afternoon
sunshine
was
almost
dazzling
what
is
it
what
are
you
looking
for
asked
ruby
coming
back
a
step
or
two
and
standing
beside
him
do
come
on
it
too
cold
to
hang
about
for
once
winfried
was
less
polite
than
usual
he
did
not
answer
ruby
but
turned
to
mavis
who
was
a
little
behind
do
you
see
anything
he
asked
and
mavis
following
his
eyes
answered
yes
there
oh
there
a
little
boat
drifting
in
a
tiny
boat
is
it
drifting
no
there
some
one
in
it
some
one
with
a
blue
cloak
no
it
must
have
been
the
waves
just
touching
the
waves
are
so
blue
the
boy
gave
a
little
sigh
of
satisfaction
i
thought
so
he
said
then
he
sprang
forward
eagerly
come
on
he
cried
we
must
be
late
ruby
followed
not
too
pleased
i
as
good
eyes
as
mavis
she
said
why
did
you
ask
me
i
do
believe
there
a
boat
at
all
but
even
ruby
had
to
give
in
when
in
a
few
minutes
they
found
themselves
at
the
edge
of
the
cove
on
the
little
of
sand
which
was
all
that
the
sea
left
uncovered
at
full
tide
for
there
a
boat
a
most
unmistakable
and
delightful
boat
though
scarcely
larger
than
a
sofa
and
looking
like
a
perfect
toy
as
it
rocked
gently
on
the
rippling
water
goodness
said
ruby
and
it
must
be
allowed
that
goodness
is
a
prettier
word
than
rubbish
how
in
the
world
did
that
boat
come
here
did
you
bring
it
winfried
no
for
if
you
had
you
would
have
been
looking
to
see
if
it
had
come
but
is
it
your
boat
no
answered
the
boy
it
lent
me
on
purpose
for
you
and
miss
mavis
get
in
please
ruby
came
forward
but
hesitated
are
you
sure
it
safe
she
said
you
know
the
sea
is
very
rough
round
there
near
the
village
and
this
is
such
a
very
little
boat
winfried
laughed
it
as
safe
as
as
the
safest
thing
you
can
think
of
he
said
not
afraid
miss
mavis
for
all
answer
the
little
girl
sprang
into
the
boat
it
danced
under
her
feet
but
she
only
laughed
come
on
ruby
she
called
out
it
lovely
ruby
stepped
in
cautiously
the
little
boat
was
most
dainty
and
pretty
there
were
cushions
for
the
little
girls
and
one
or
two
soft
rich
coloured
shawls
of
a
fashion
and
material
such
as
they
had
never
seen
before
dear
me
said
ruby
settling
herself
in
the
most
comfortable
place
and
drawing
the
pretty
rugs
round
her
what
a
nice
little
boat
your
friends
must
be
very
rich
winfried
but
i
know
what
i
know
and
she
shook
her
head
mysteriously
what
do
you
mean
ruby
said
mavis
winfried
was
busy
with
his
oars
and
did
not
seem
to
be
attending
to
them
ruby
leant
forward
and
whispered
close
into
her
sister
ear
then
seeing
or
thinking
that
the
boy
was
not
listening
she
went
on
you
know
mermaids
very
rich
they
dive
down
into
the
shipwrecked
vessels
and
fish
up
all
the
treasures
i
daresay
these
shawls
have
come
from
some
strange
country
right
over
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
indeed
people
say
that
the
horrid
things
sing
to
make
the
sailors
turn
to
look
for
them
and
get
their
ships
all
in
among
the
rocks
mavis
looked
puzzled
i
do
think
that
she
said
there
another
name
for
those
naughty
unkind
creatures
syrens
came
winfried
voice
from
the
other
end
of
the
boat
and
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
at
the
little
girls
start
of
surprise
be
afraid
he
said
my
friends
are
neither
mermaids
nor
syrens
not
going
to
be
shipwrecked
in
this
boat
i
promise
you
somehow
the
boy
seemed
to
have
gained
a
new
kind
of
dignity
now
that
the
children
were
so
to
say
his
guests
ruby
said
thank
you
quite
meekly
and
submissively
for
her
then
they
were
all
quite
silent
for
a
while
only
the
plash
of
winfried
oars
broke
the
stillness
and
somehow
out
there
on
the
water
it
seemed
to
have
grown
warmer
at
least
the
children
felt
conscious
of
neither
cold
nor
heat
it
was
just
perfectly
pleasant
and
the
sun
shone
on
mildly
there
was
a
thorough
feeling
of
afternoon
with
its
quiet
and
mystery
and
yet
faint
expectation
such
as
one
seldom
has
except
in
summer
it
is
lovely
said
mavis
presently
only
i
a
little
afraid
getting
sleepy
no
you
need
be
afraid
said
winfried
and
just
as
he
said
the
words
mavis
started
as
something
flitted
against
her
cheek
ruby
ruby
she
exclaimed
did
you
see
it
a
butterfly
a
blue
butterfly
in
november
oh
where
has
it
gone
to
and
she
gazed
all
round
anxiously
chapter
five
the
fisherman
hut
there
are
things
which
through
the
gazing
eye
reach
the
full
soul
and
thrill
it
into
love
my
ruby
burst
out
laughing
you
been
asleep
and
dreaming
you
silly
girl
she
said
winfried
do
you
hear
mavis
says
a
blue
butterfly
flew
past
it
kissed
my
cheek
said
mavis
winfried
smiled
it
quite
possible
he
said
ruby
was
just
turning
upon
him
with
her
laughter
when
something
made
jump
in
turn
something
cold
and
damp
touched
her
hand
she
had
taken
her
glove
off
and
was
dabbling
idly
in
the
water
ugh
she
said
i
do
believe
that
was
a
toad
the
laugh
was
against
her
now
a
toad
ruby
out
at
sea
what
are
you
thinking
of
said
mavis
you
need
make
fun
of
my
butterfly
if
you
talk
of
toads
well
it
was
something
slimy
and
horrid
like
a
toad
said
ruby
perhaps
it
was
only
a
fish
but
whatever
it
was
i
believe
it
was
a
trick
of
winfried
i
sure
positive
sure
you
a
wizard
winfried
she
was
half
in
fun
and
half
in
earnest
but
the
boy
took
it
quite
composedly
no
i
not
he
said
and
no
more
is
gran
but
people
understand
you
see
if
they
see
that
one
a
bit
different
from
others
they
no
words
for
it
but
wizard
and
uncanny
and
they
get
frightened
when
it
should
be
just
the
other
way
this
was
much
more
of
a
speech
than
the
was
in
the
habit
of
making
both
the
children
listened
with
interest
how
is
your
gran
different
from
others
asked
ruby
you
see
it
in
his
face
at
least
i
think
you
will
said
winfried
but
now
i
must
talk
we
close
to
the
little
creek
he
got
the
boat
in
most
cleverly
to
a
very
tiny
creek
where
was
a
little
and
leading
upwards
from
it
a
flight
of
steps
cut
in
the
rock
how
funny
how
very
funny
we
never
saw
this
place
before
exclaimed
the
little
girls
do
you
keep
the
boat
here
winfried
sometimes
he
replied
but
not
we
wo
need
it
again
he
folded
up
the
shawls
and
laid
them
neatly
on
the
cushions
then
he
drew
in
the
oars
and
in
another
moment
he
had
helped
the
children
to
get
on
shore
and
all
three
had
mounted
several
of
the
rock
steps
when
winfried
called
to
them
to
stop
for
a
moment
look
down
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
the
little
girls
saw
something
moving
there
below
where
they
had
just
landed
it
was
the
little
boat
calmly
and
steadily
it
was
moving
out
to
sea
though
it
had
no
sails
and
the
oars
were
lying
just
as
winfried
had
drawn
them
in
oh
winfried
exclaimed
ruby
the
dear
little
boat
it
drifting
out
it
will
be
lost
ca
you
jump
into
the
water
and
drag
it
back
it
all
right
said
the
boy
it
going
home
till
it
needed
again
i
only
wanted
you
to
see
how
quietly
it
goes
off
once
its
business
is
done
and
he
turned
and
began
to
whistle
softly
as
he
went
on
up
the
steps
said
ruby
half
triumphant
and
half
frightened
in
a
whisper
to
mavis
now
can
you
say
he
not
a
wizard
i
think
cousin
hortensia
was
very
silly
to
let
us
come
with
him
but
it
was
all
you
mavis
going
on
about
him
so
if
we
not
turned
into
toads
or
lizards
before
we
get
home
i
butterflies
would
be
nicer
said
mavis
laughing
i
ask
winfried
and
his
gran
to
make
me
into
a
blue
butterfly
and
you
can
be
a
yellow
one
if
you
like
she
seemed
to
have
caught
something
of
winfried
happy
confidence
ruby
looked
at
her
in
surprise
but
it
was
mixed
with
anger
what
she
was
going
to
have
said
i
do
know
for
just
then
their
guide
called
out
again
here
we
are
he
said
if
you
stoop
your
heads
a
little
and
looking
up
the
children
saw
before
them
a
narrow
low
archway
at
the
entrance
to
which
the
steps
stopped
ruby
hung
back
a
little
but
mavis
ran
forward
it
all
right
ruby
she
called
back
and
oh
what
a
pretty
garden
do
come
quick
ruby
followed
it
was
only
necessary
to
stoop
for
a
moment
or
two
then
she
found
herself
beside
her
sister
and
she
could
not
help
joining
in
her
exclamation
of
pleasure
somehow
or
other
they
had
arrived
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
which
at
this
side
they
now
saw
stood
in
a
pretty
and
sheltered
garden
perhaps
garden
is
hardly
the
word
to
use
for
though
there
were
flowers
of
more
than
one
kind
and
plants
there
were
other
things
one
does
not
often
see
in
a
garden
there
were
ever
so
many
little
bowers
and
grottoes
cleverly
put
together
of
different
kinds
of
and
fragments
of
rock
there
were
two
or
three
basins
hollowed
out
of
the
same
stones
in
which
clear
water
sparkled
and
brilliant
seaweed
of
every
shade
from
delicate
pink
to
crimson
glowed
there
were
shells
of
strange
and
wonderful
form
and
tints
as
many
as
those
of
the
rainbow
arranged
so
that
at
a
little
distance
they
looked
like
groups
of
flowers
in
short
ruby
was
not
far
wrong
when
returning
to
her
old
idea
she
whispered
to
mavis
it
a
garden
and
i
only
hope
she
went
on
in
the
same
tone
we
sha
find
that
somehow
or
other
he
has
got
us
down
under
the
sea
without
our
knowing
mavis
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
do
be
afraid
she
said
look
up
there
the
good
old
sun
smiling
as
usual
with
no
water
between
him
and
us
and
see
here
ruby
and
she
ran
forward
there
are
earth
flower
too
as
well
as
sea
ones
she
was
right
on
a
border
sheltered
by
the
wall
of
the
cottage
were
great
masses
of
fern
still
green
and
luxuriant
and
here
and
there
among
them
clumps
brilliantly
blue
of
the
tender
loving
it
like
that
bunch
of
it
we
found
on
our
terrace
said
mavis
joyfully
i
really
could
believe
you
had
brought
a
root
of
it
and
planted
it
there
for
us
winfried
i
never
saw
such
beauties
gran
loves
it
was
all
the
boy
said
then
he
led
them
round
to
the
front
of
the
house
and
opened
the
door
for
them
to
enter
inside
the
cottage
all
was
very
plain
but
very
very
neat
and
clean
in
an
large
wooden
by
the
fire
sat
old
adam
he
looked
very
old
older
than
the
children
had
expected
and
a
kind
of
awe
came
over
them
his
hair
was
white
but
scarcely
whiter
than
his
face
his
hands
were
unusually
delicate
and
refined
though
gnarled
and
knotted
as
are
those
of
aged
people
he
looked
up
with
a
smile
for
his
sight
was
still
good
as
his
visitors
came
in
you
will
forgive
my
not
standing
up
my
dear
little
ladies
he
said
you
see
i
am
very
old
it
is
good
of
you
to
come
to
see
me
i
have
often
seen
you
oftener
than
you
knew
since
you
were
very
tiny
things
have
you
lived
here
a
long
time
then
asked
ruby
it
would
seem
a
long
time
to
you
though
not
to
me
he
said
with
a
smile
and
long
ago
before
that
i
knew
your
grandmother
and
the
lady
who
takes
care
of
you
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
a
man
too
for
that
matter
my
home
was
where
theirs
was
so
i
remember
your
mother
when
she
was
as
little
as
you
oh
how
nice
exclaimed
mavis
was
our
mother
like
us
mr
adam
you
may
be
very
like
her
if
you
wish
he
said
kindly
but
their
attention
was
already
distracted
on
a
small
table
close
beside
the
old
man
chair
in
what
at
first
sight
looked
like
a
delicate
china
cup
but
was
in
reality
a
large
and
lovely
shell
was
a
posy
freshly
gathered
apparently
of
the
same
beautiful
oh
these
are
out
of
your
garden
said
ruby
how
do
you
manage
to
make
them
grow
so
well
and
so
late
in
the
year
the
part
of
the
garden
where
they
grow
is
not
mine
said
adam
quietly
it
belongs
to
a
friend
who
tends
it
herself
i
could
not
succeed
as
she
does
is
is
she
a
mermaid
asked
ruby
her
eyes
growing
very
round
no
my
dear
mermaids
flowers
if
they
have
any
would
scarcely
be
like
these
i
think
you
speak
as
if
there
are
no
such
things
as
mermaids
do
you
not
think
there
are
said
mavis
old
adam
shook
his
head
i
have
never
seen
one
but
i
would
never
take
upon
myself
to
say
there
is
nothing
but
what
i
seen
tell
us
about
the
friend
who
plants
these
in
your
garden
said
ruby
touching
the
could
it
have
been
she
who
put
some
on
the
terrace
at
the
castle
for
us
maybe
said
the
old
man
is
she
a
lady
or
or
a
fairy
or
what
is
she
if
she
not
a
mermaid
asked
ruby
before
the
old
man
could
answer
winfried
voice
made
her
start
in
surprise
she
a
princess
he
said
and
he
smiled
all
over
his
face
when
he
saw
ruby
astonishment
oh
was
all
she
said
but
her
manner
became
more
respectful
to
both
adam
and
his
grandson
from
that
moment
then
the
old
man
made
a
sign
to
winfried
and
the
boy
went
out
of
the
room
coming
back
in
a
moment
with
a
little
plain
wooden
tray
on
which
were
two
glasses
of
rich
milk
and
a
basket
of
cakes
brown
and
crisp
of
a
kind
the
children
had
never
seen
before
he
set
the
tray
down
on
a
table
which
stood
in
the
window
and
adam
begged
the
children
to
help
themselves
they
did
so
gladly
never
had
cake
and
milk
tasted
so
delicious
ruby
felt
rather
small
when
she
thought
of
her
condescending
offer
of
soup
from
the
castle
kitchen
but
then
she
reflected
of
course
i
did
know
how
could
i
that
a
princess
comes
to
see
them
i
daresay
she
sends
them
these
delicious
cakes
i
wish
bertha
could
make
some
like
them
i
never
saw
cakes
like
these
before
said
little
mavis
they
are
good
old
adam
seemed
pleased
my
boy
is
a
bad
cook
he
said
proudly
with
a
glance
at
winfried
did
make
them
said
ruby
staring
at
winfried
i
thought
perhaps
as
a
princess
comes
to
see
you
that
sent
you
them
they
are
so
very
good
winfried
could
not
help
laughing
something
in
ruby
speech
seemed
to
him
so
comical
then
at
the
little
girls
request
he
took
them
out
again
to
examine
some
of
the
wonders
of
the
he
fished
out
some
lovely
sprays
of
seaweed
for
them
and
gave
them
also
several
of
the
prettiest
shells
best
of
all
he
gathered
a
sweet
nosegay
of
the
which
mavis
said
she
would
take
home
to
cousin
hortensia
and
then
as
the
sun
by
this
time
had
travelled
a
long
way
downwards
they
ran
in
to
bid
old
adam
and
to
thank
him
before
setting
off
homewards
how
are
we
going
asked
ruby
you
sent
away
the
boat
i
could
call
it
back
again
but
i
think
we
had
better
go
a
shorter
way
said
winfried
you
not
frightened
of
a
little
bit
of
the
dark
are
you
there
a
nice
short
cut
to
the
rock
path
through
one
of
the
arbours
the
little
girls
followed
him
feeling
very
curious
and
perhaps
just
a
tiny
scrap
afraid
he
led
them
into
one
of
the
grottoes
which
to
their
surprise
they
found
a
good
deal
larger
than
they
had
expected
for
it
lengthened
out
at
the
back
into
a
sort
of
cave
this
cave
was
too
dark
for
them
to
see
its
size
but
winfried
plunged
fearlessly
into
its
recesses
i
must
see
that
the
way
is
clear
he
said
as
he
left
them
wait
where
you
are
for
a
few
minutes
ruby
was
not
very
pleased
at
being
treated
so
unceremoniously
i
do
call
waiting
here
a
quick
way
of
getting
home
she
said
and
i
hate
the
dark
i
a
good
mind
to
run
out
and
go
back
the
regular
way
mavis
oh
no
mavis
was
beginning
but
just
then
both
children
started
it
seemed
to
have
grown
suddenly
dark
outside
as
if
a
cloud
or
mist
had
come
over
the
sky
and
as
they
gazed
out
feeling
rather
bewildered
a
clear
voice
sounded
through
the
grotto
ruby
mavis
it
said
ruby
turned
to
mavis
it
a
trick
of
that
boy
she
said
he
wants
to
startle
us
he
has
no
business
to
call
us
by
out
names
like
that
i
not
stay
and
she
ran
out
mavis
was
following
her
to
bring
her
back
when
a
ray
of
light
scarcely
a
ray
rather
i
should
say
a
soft
glow
seemed
to
fill
the
entrance
to
the
grotto
and
gradually
as
her
eyes
got
used
to
it
she
distinguished
a
lovely
figure
a
lady
with
soft
garments
floating
round
her
and
a
sweet
grave
face
was
standing
there
looking
at
her
a
strange
thrill
passed
through
the
child
yet
even
as
she
felt
it
she
knew
it
was
not
a
thrill
of
fear
and
something
seemed
to
draw
her
eyes
upwards
a
touch
she
could
not
have
resisted
if
she
had
wished
till
they
found
their
in
meeting
those
that
were
bent
upon
her
those
beautiful
wonderful
blue
eyes
eyes
like
none
she
had
ever
seen
or
nay
she
had
of
such
eyes
they
were
like
those
of
the
fairy
lady
in
her
old
cousin
dream
and
now
mavis
knew
in
part
why
the
strange
vision
did
seem
strange
to
her
why
rather
she
felt
as
if
she
had
always
known
it
would
come
as
if
all
her
life
she
had
been
expecting
this
moment
mavis
said
the
soft
yet
clear
and
thrilling
voice
you
see
me
my
child
yes
said
the
little
girl
speaking
steadily
though
in
a
whisper
i
see
you
and
i
see
your
eyes
who
are
you
i
may
ask
you
may
i
not
the
fairy
if
fairy
she
was
smiled
i
have
many
names
she
said
but
if
you
like
you
may
think
of
me
by
the
one
winfried
loves
he
calls
me
with
the
eyes
or
yes
said
mavis
i
like
that
and
i
will
never
forget
you
princess
again
the
lovely
vision
smiled
no
my
child
you
never
will
for
to
tell
you
a
secret
you
can
not
even
if
you
wished
afterwards
when
you
know
better
you
will
see
how
well
my
name
suits
me
but
it
does
not
seem
to
all
a
sweet
name
as
i
think
it
always
will
to
you
and
she
sighed
a
little
there
are
those
who
long
to
forget
me
those
who
wish
they
had
never
seen
me
the
sadness
in
her
eyes
was
reflected
in
the
child
how
can
that
be
asked
mavis
the
princess
shook
her
head
nay
my
darling
i
can
not
tell
you
and
i
scarce
would
if
i
could
she
said
gently
but
then
a
brighter
look
came
over
her
face
again
look
so
sad
they
change
again
some
of
them
and
seek
me
as
earnestly
as
they
would
have
before
fled
from
me
and
some
day
you
may
help
and
guide
such
seekers
simple
as
you
are
my
little
mavis
now
i
must
go
call
ruby
she
would
not
stay
for
me
she
has
not
yet
seen
me
but
she
heard
my
voice
that
is
better
than
nothing
little
mavis
and
if
you
want
me
again
before
i
come
of
myself
seek
me
in
the
west
turret
mavis
face
lighted
up
then
it
you
you
are
cousin
hortensia
fairy
and
it
was
a
dream
after
all
and
of
course
you
must
be
a
fairy
for
that
was
ever
ever
so
long
ago
she
was
a
little
girl
then
and
now
she
is
quite
old
and
you
look
as
young
as
as
as
who
or
what
asked
the
princess
smiling
again
as
the
sleeping
beauty
in
the
wood
replied
mavis
after
deep
consideration
at
this
the
princess
did
more
than
smile
she
laughed
the
same
clear
delicate
laugh
which
the
children
had
heard
that
day
in
the
distance
and
mavis
laughed
too
she
could
not
help
it
may
i
tell
cousin
hortensia
she
asked
oh
do
say
i
may
you
may
said
if
if
you
and
while
mavis
was
wondering
what
she
meant
a
breath
of
soft
wind
seemed
to
blow
past
her
and
glancing
up
the
princess
was
gone
mavis
rubbed
her
eyes
had
she
been
asleep
it
seemed
a
long
time
since
winfried
told
her
and
ruby
to
wait
for
him
in
the
grotto
and
where
was
ruby
why
did
she
not
come
back
mavis
began
to
feel
uneasy
surely
she
had
been
asleep
for
was
she
asleep
still
looking
round
her
she
saw
that
she
was
no
longer
in
the
behind
old
cottage
but
standing
in
the
archway
at
the
sea
side
of
the
castle
the
archway
i
have
told
you
of
into
which
opened
the
principal
entrance
to
the
grim
old
building
and
as
she
stood
there
silent
and
perplexed
uncertain
whether
she
was
not
still
dreaming
she
heard
voices
coming
near
the
first
she
could
distinguish
was
ruby
there
you
are
mavis
i
declare
she
exclaimed
now
it
too
bad
of
you
to
have
run
on
so
fast
without
telling
and
i
been
fussing
about
you
all
the
way
home
though
winfried
said
he
was
sure
we
should
find
you
here
how
you
get
back
how
did
asked
mavis
in
return
and
why
did
you
come
back
to
me
in
the
grotto
i
i
waited
ever
so
long
and
then
but
that
was
all
she
could
say
though
a
smile
broke
over
her
face
when
she
thought
of
what
she
had
seen
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
asleep
said
ruby
impatiently
and
having
pleasant
dreams
added
winfried
but
all
well
that
ends
well
wo
you
run
in
now
my
little
ladies
and
let
miss
hortensia
see
that
i
brought
you
safe
back
it
is
cold
and
dark
standing
out
here
and
i
must
be
off
home
then
said
ruby
you
a
very
queer
boy
but
you
brought
home
all
right
any
way
and
those
cakes
were
very
good
you
will
come
to
see
us
soon
again
wo
you
winfried
said
mavis
who
felt
as
if
she
had
a
great
deal
to
ask
which
only
he
could
answer
though
with
ruby
there
beside
her
she
could
not
have
explained
what
she
wanted
to
know
to
be
sure
i
will
if
you
want
me
said
the
boy
do
be
puzzled
miss
mavis
pleasant
dreams
do
do
any
one
harm
and
as
they
pushed
open
the
great
door
which
was
never
locked
till
after
nightfall
winfried
ran
off
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
just
inside
the
entrance
they
could
hear
him
whistling
as
he
went
smoothly
at
first
then
it
seemed
to
come
in
jerks
going
on
for
a
moment
or
two
and
then
suddenly
stopping
to
begin
again
as
suddenly
he
jumping
down
the
cliff
i
can
hear
it
by
his
whistle
said
ruby
how
dangerous
he
very
said
mavis
with
a
little
sigh
she
was
feeling
tired
and
it
a
dream
if
so
how
had
she
got
home
had
the
fairy
lady
wrapped
her
round
in
her
cloak
of
mist
and
flown
with
her
to
the
castle
mavis
could
not
tell
and
somehow
ruby
did
not
ask
her
again
how
did
you
come
home
ruby
mavis
asked
as
they
were
going
along
the
passage
to
their
oh
said
ruby
winfried
took
me
down
some
steps
and
then
up
some
others
and
before
i
knew
where
we
were
we
were
in
the
rock
path
not
far
from
home
it
was
like
magic
i
ca
make
out
that
boy
she
said
mysteriously
but
we
not
turned
into
frogs
or
toads
here
we
are
cousin
hortensia
she
went
on
as
the
good
lady
suddenly
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
passage
safe
home
from
the
wizard
haunts
but
miss
hortensia
only
smiled
i
was
not
uneasy
she
said
i
thought
you
would
be
quite
safe
chapter
six
bertrand
but
the
unkind
and
the
unruly
and
the
sort
who
eat
unduly
theirs
is
quite
a
different
story
and
bad
louis
stevenson
they
were
just
beginning
tea
and
ruby
tongue
was
going
fast
as
she
described
to
miss
hortensia
all
that
happened
that
afternoon
while
mavis
sat
wondering
what
the
fairy
lady
had
meant
by
saying
she
might
tell
her
cousin
about
her
if
she
when
there
came
a
sudden
and
unusual
sound
that
made
them
all
start
it
was
the
clanging
of
the
great
bell
at
the
principal
entrance
on
the
south
side
the
entrance
by
which
you
remember
all
visitors
except
those
coming
by
sea
came
to
the
castle
who
can
that
be
exclaimed
ruby
jumping
up
and
looking
very
pleased
ruby
loved
any
excitement
can
it
be
father
what
fun
if
he
come
to
surprise
us
only
i
hope
he
wo
have
forgotten
our
presents
he
generally
asks
us
what
we
want
before
he
comes
mavis
had
grown
a
little
pale
somehow
the
things
that
ruby
was
frightened
of
never
alarmed
her
and
yet
she
was
more
easily
startled
by
others
that
ruby
rather
enjoyed
i
hope
it
is
a
message
to
say
that
anything
is
the
matter
with
dear
father
she
said
anxiously
miss
hortensia
got
up
from
her
seat
and
went
to
the
door
she
did
not
seem
frightened
but
still
rather
uneasy
i
afraid
she
began
i
afraid
and
yet
i
should
not
speak
of
it
that
way
it
is
not
kind
but
i
did
so
ask
them
to
give
us
notice
of
his
coming
she
had
left
the
room
almost
before
she
had
finished
speaking
the
children
looked
at
each
other
i
say
mavis
said
ruby
it
bertrand
do
you
think
we
might
run
out
and
see
no
mavis
replied
decidedly
certainly
not
cousin
hortensia
would
have
told
us
to
come
if
she
had
wanted
us
but
they
went
to
the
open
door
and
stood
close
beside
it
listening
intently
then
came
the
sound
of
old
joseph
steps
along
the
stone
passage
from
the
part
of
the
house
which
he
and
bertha
joseph
was
bertha
husband
inhabited
then
the
drawing
back
of
the
bolts
and
bars
and
most
interesting
and
exciting
of
all
a
noise
of
horses
stamping
and
shaking
their
harness
as
if
glad
to
have
got
to
the
end
of
their
journey
then
followed
voices
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
children
heard
miss
hortensia
coming
back
speaking
as
she
came
you
must
be
very
cold
my
dear
boy
and
hungry
too
she
was
saying
we
are
just
beginning
tea
so
you
had
better
come
in
at
once
as
you
are
it
terribly
cold
and
that
fool
of
a
driver
would
come
any
faster
he
said
his
horses
were
tired
i
wish
could
have
got
a
cut
at
them
what
are
horses
for
was
the
reply
to
miss
hortensia
kind
speech
mavis
touched
ruby
come
in
cousin
hortensia
would
like
to
see
us
standing
at
the
door
like
this
she
said
they
sat
down
at
their
places
again
only
getting
up
as
miss
hortensia
came
in
she
was
followed
by
a
boy
he
was
about
the
height
of
the
twins
broad
and
wrapped
up
in
a
rich
coat
and
with
a
travelling
cap
of
the
same
fur
still
on
his
head
he
was
and
a
handsome
boy
with
a
haughty
rather
contemptuous
expression
of
face
an
expression
winch
it
did
not
take
much
to
turn
into
a
scowl
if
he
was
annoyed
or
put
out
these
are
your
cousins
bertrand
your
cousins
ruby
and
mavis
you
have
heard
of
them
i
am
sure
though
you
have
never
met
each
other
before
bertrand
looked
up
coolly
i
knew
there
were
girls
here
he
answered
mother
said
so
but
i
do
care
for
girls
i
told
mother
so
i
awfully
hungry
and
he
began
to
pull
forward
a
chair
my
dear
said
miss
hortensia
do
you
know
you
have
not
taken
off
your
cap
yet
you
must
take
off
your
coat
too
but
above
all
your
cap
bertrand
put
up
his
hand
and
slowly
drew
off
his
cap
mother
never
minds
he
said
but
there
was
a
slight
touch
of
apology
in
the
words
then
more
for
his
own
comfort
evidently
than
out
of
any
sense
of
courtesy
he
pulled
off
his
heavy
coat
and
flung
it
on
to
a
chair
the
little
girls
had
not
yet
spoken
to
him
they
felt
too
much
taken
aback
perhaps
he
is
shy
and
strange
and
that
makes
him
seem
rough
thought
mavis
and
she
began
drawing
forward
another
chair
will
you
sit
here
she
was
saying
when
bertrand
pushed
past
her
i
sit
by
the
fire
he
said
and
he
calmly
settled
himself
on
what
he
could
not
but
have
seen
was
her
seat
or
ruby
and
i
awfully
hungry
he
went
on
at
home
i
have
dinner
at
least
if
i
want
it
i
do
it
only
fit
for
girls
to
have
tea
in
this
babyish
way
he
helped
himself
to
a
large
slice
of
cake
as
he
spoke
and
not
content
with
this
he
also
put
a
big
piece
of
butter
on
his
plate
miss
hortensia
glanced
at
him
and
was
evidently
just
going
to
speak
but
checked
herself
it
was
bertrand
first
evening
and
she
was
a
very
hospitable
person
but
when
bertrand
proceeded
to
butter
his
cake
thickly
ruby
never
accustomed
to
control
her
tongue
burst
out
that
cake
bertrand
she
said
people
do
butter
do
they
just
said
the
boy
speaking
with
his
mouth
full
do
i
know
and
at
home
mother
never
minds
does
she
let
you
do
whatever
you
like
asked
ruby
yes
said
bertrand
and
whether
she
did
or
not
i
do
it
all
the
same
then
he
broke
into
a
merry
laugh
it
was
one
of
the
few
attractive
things
about
him
beside
his
good
looks
that
laugh
of
his
it
made
him
seem
for
the
time
a
hearty
child
and
gave
one
the
feeling
that
he
did
not
really
mean
the
things
he
said
and
did
and
now
that
his
hunger
was
appeased
and
he
was
warm
and
comfortable
he
became
much
more
amiable
ruby
looked
at
him
with
admiration
i
wish
i
lived
with
your
mother
she
said
how
nice
it
must
be
to
do
always
just
what
one
likes
do
you
think
so
said
mavis
i
think
it
would
be
quite
miserable
quite
right
mavis
said
miss
hortensia
when
i
was
a
child
i
remember
reading
a
story
of
a
little
girl
who
for
a
great
treat
one
birthday
was
allowed
to
do
just
what
she
wanted
all
day
and
oh
dear
how
unhappy
she
was
before
evening
came
bertrand
stared
at
her
with
his
big
eyes
eyes
are
very
misleading
his
looked
now
and
then
as
if
he
had
nothing
but
kind
and
beautiful
thoughts
behind
them
what
a
fool
she
must
have
been
he
said
roughly
and
poor
miss
hortensia
heart
sank
the
evening
was
not
a
long
one
for
bertrand
was
tired
with
his
journey
and
for
once
willing
to
do
as
he
was
told
by
going
to
bed
early
a
room
near
his
cousins
had
been
preparing
for
him
and
though
not
quite
ready
a
good
fire
made
it
look
very
cosy
they
all
went
upstairs
with
him
to
show
him
the
way
as
they
passed
the
great
baize
door
which
divided
their
wing
from
the
rest
of
the
house
bertrand
pushed
it
open
what
through
there
he
asked
in
his
usual
unceremonious
way
oh
all
the
rest
of
the
castle
said
ruby
importantly
bertrand
peered
through
it
was
like
looking
into
a
great
church
with
all
the
lights
out
for
this
door
opened
right
upon
the
gallery
running
round
the
large
hall
what
a
ramshackle
old
cavern
said
bertrand
a
blast
of
cold
air
rushed
in
through
the
doorway
as
he
spoke
and
made
them
all
shiver
nonsense
bertrand
said
miss
hortensia
more
sharply
than
she
had
yet
spoken
to
him
it
is
a
splendid
old
house
you
should
see
the
staircases
up
to
the
turrets
said
ruby
they
are
as
high
as
as
i
do
know
what
if
you
are
naughty
we
can
put
you
to
sleep
in
the
west
and
they
say
it
haunted
should
mind
that
laughed
bertrand
nor
should
i
said
ruby
boastfully
mavis
here
is
a
dreadful
coward
and
oh
bertrand
i
tell
you
something
i
have
such
an
idea
do
you
love
playing
tricks
on
people
people
who
set
themselves
up
you
know
and
preach
at
you
her
last
words
were
almost
whispered
and
miss
hortensia
who
had
gone
on
in
front
they
had
closed
the
swing
door
by
this
time
did
not
hear
them
but
mavis
caught
what
ruby
said
and
she
waited
uneasily
for
bertrand
answer
prigs
you
mean
he
said
i
hate
prigs
yes
indeed
i
join
you
in
any
game
of
that
kind
you
should
have
seen
how
we
served
a
little
wretch
at
school
who
tried
to
stop
us
teaching
a
puppy
to
swim
such
a
joke
the
puppy
could
scarcely
walk
much
less
swim
so
we
took
master
prig
and
made
swim
instead
it
was
winter
and
he
caught
a
jolly
cold
and
had
to
leave
school
did
he
get
better
said
mavis
in
a
strange
voice
do
know
i
sure
i
should
think
not
his
mother
was
too
poor
to
pay
for
a
doctor
they
said
he
no
business
to
be
at
a
school
with
gentlemen
said
bertrand
brutally
mavis
gasped
then
suddenly
without
saying
to
any
one
she
rushed
down
the
passage
to
the
room
she
shared
with
her
sister
and
there
ruby
found
her
a
few
minutes
later
on
her
knees
and
all
in
the
dark
what
the
matter
with
you
cousin
hortensia
told
me
to
say
to
you
for
her
it
was
very
civil
to
fly
off
like
that
the
first
night
bertrand
was
here
i
sure
cousin
hortensia
thought
so
too
said
ruby
carelessly
my
goodness
are
you
as
the
light
she
carried
fell
on
mavis
face
cousin
hortensia
did
said
mavis
oh
ruby
i
ca
bear
it
what
that
wicked
boy
oh
ruby
you
ca
say
you
like
him
i
think
he
lots
of
fun
in
him
said
ruby
wonderingly
he
only
a
boy
you
are
so
queer
mavis
but
catching
sight
again
of
her
expression
she
suddenly
changed
poor
little
mavie
she
cried
throwing
her
arms
round
her
you
such
a
goose
you
far
too
mavis
clung
to
her
sobbing
oh
ruby
my
ruby
she
said
do
speak
like
that
i
you
to
get
hard
and
cruel
but
ruby
was
for
her
wonderfully
gentle
and
kind
and
at
last
the
two
little
sisters
kissed
each
other
promising
that
nothing
should
ever
come
between
them
a
good
night
rest
and
a
huge
breakfast
put
master
bertrand
into
a
very
fairly
amiable
humour
the
next
morning
he
flatly
refused
however
to
do
any
lessons
though
it
was
intended
that
he
should
and
miss
hortensia
judging
it
best
to
make
a
virtue
of
necessity
told
him
he
should
have
his
time
to
himself
for
three
days
after
which
he
must
join
the
twins
in
the
for
these
three
days
she
said
i
will
give
ruby
and
mavis
a
so
that
they
may
go
about
with
you
and
show
you
everything
but
if
you
do
not
come
regularly
and
punctually
to
lessons
after
that
i
will
not
give
your
cousins
any
extra
holidays
while
you
are
here
she
spoke
firmly
and
bertrand
looked
at
her
with
surprise
he
was
surprised
indeed
into
unusual
meekness
for
he
said
nothing
but
all
right
they
gave
him
some
directions
as
to
where
he
would
be
most
likely
to
amuse
himself
and
with
safety
indeed
unless
one
were
to
hurt
oneself
there
were
no
really
dangerous
places
about
the
castle
in
spite
of
the
cliffs
and
the
sea
ruby
and
mavis
had
played
there
all
their
lives
without
ever
getting
into
mischief
he
is
not
a
stupid
boy
said
miss
hortensia
after
giving
her
instructions
to
bertrand
and
i
have
no
doubt
he
can
take
care
of
himself
if
he
likes
i
sure
he
would
like
to
hurt
himself
said
ruby
with
a
little
contempt
he
the
sort
of
boy
that
would
hate
pain
or
being
it
is
to
be
hoped
nothing
of
that
kind
will
happen
while
he
is
here
said
miss
hortensia
but
i
can
only
do
my
best
i
did
not
seek
the
charge
and
it
would
be
quite
impossible
to
shut
him
up
in
the
house
he
very
likely
try
to
get
out
of
the
window
if
you
did
cousin
hortensia
said
mavis
with
her
gentle
little
laugh
she
was
feeling
happy
for
ruby
had
continued
kind
and
gentle
this
morning
and
if
i
were
a
boy
i
not
sure
but
that
i
would
too
if
i
were
shut
up
well
let
us
get
to
our
work
said
miss
hortensia
with
a
resigned
little
sigh
lessons
were
over
ruby
and
mavis
had
had
their
usual
morning
run
along
the
terrace
had
brushed
their
hair
and
washed
their
hands
and
were
standing
up
while
miss
hortensia
said
grace
before
beginning
dinner
when
bertrand
appeared
he
came
banging
in
his
cap
on
his
head
his
boots
wet
and
dirty
his
cheeks
flushed
and
his
eyes
bright
with
running
and
excitement
he
looked
very
pretty
notwithstanding
the
untidy
state
he
was
in
but
it
was
impossible
to
welcome
him
cordially
he
was
so
rude
and
careless
leaving
the
door
wide
open
and
bringing
in
a
strong
fishy
smell
the
reason
of
which
was
explained
when
he
flung
down
a
great
mass
of
coarse
slimy
seaweed
he
had
been
carrying
you
nasty
dirty
boy
said
ruby
turning
up
her
nose
and
sniffing
really
bertrand
my
dear
began
miss
hortensia
what
have
you
brought
that
wet
seaweed
here
for
it
can
not
stay
in
this
room
i
take
it
away
said
mavis
jumping
up
what
harm
does
it
do
said
bertrand
sitting
down
sideways
on
his
chair
i
want
it
i
say
you
not
to
go
pitching
it
away
mavis
well
when
am
i
to
have
something
to
eat
go
and
wash
your
hands
and
hang
up
your
coat
and
come
and
sit
straight
at
the
table
and
then
i
will
give
you
your
dinner
said
miss
hortensia
drily
why
ca
you
give
it
me
now
said
bertrand
with
the
ugly
scowl
on
his
face
because
i
will
not
she
replied
decidedly
the
roast
meat
looked
very
tempting
so
did
the
tart
on
the
sideboard
bertrand
lounged
up
out
of
his
seat
and
in
a
few
minutes
lounged
back
again
eating
generally
put
him
into
a
better
temper
when
he
had
got
through
one
plateful
and
was
ready
for
another
he
condescended
to
turn
to
his
companions
with
a
more
sociable
air
i
met
a
fellow
down
there
on
the
shore
he
said
jerking
his
head
towards
where
he
supposed
the
sea
to
be
only
a
common
chap
but
he
seems
to
know
the
place
he
was
inclined
to
be
cheeky
at
first
but
of
course
i
soon
put
him
down
i
told
him
to
be
there
this
afternoon
again
we
might
find
him
useful
now
he
knows
his
place
ruby
eyes
sparkled
i
very
glad
you
did
put
him
down
she
said
all
the
same
then
she
hesitated
do
you
know
who
he
is
asked
bertrand
he
the
best
and
nicest
and
cleverest
boy
in
all
the
world
said
little
mavis
bertrand
scowled
at
her
and
muttered
something
of
which
a
dirty
was
all
that
was
audible
miss
hortensia
presence
did
overawe
him
a
little
i
am
afraid
there
can
be
no
question
of
any
of
you
going
out
this
afternoon
she
said
glancing
out
of
the
window
as
she
spoke
it
is
clouding
over
all
over
you
must
make
up
your
minds
to
amuse
yourselves
indoors
you
can
show
bertrand
over
the
house
that
will
take
some
time
may
we
go
up
into
the
and
everywhere
said
ruby
yes
if
you
do
stay
too
long
it
is
not
very
cold
and
you
are
sure
to
keep
moving
about
there
now
comes
the
rain
come
indeed
it
did
a
regular
battle
of
wind
and
water
one
of
the
sudden
storms
one
must
often
expect
on
the
coast
but
after
the
first
outburst
the
sky
grew
somewhat
lighter
and
the
wind
went
down
a
little
the
rain
settling
into
a
steady
heavy
pour
that
threatened
to
last
several
hours
for
reasons
of
her
own
ruby
set
herself
to
coax
bertrand
into
a
good
humour
and
she
so
far
succeeded
that
he
condescended
to
go
all
over
the
castle
with
them
even
now
and
then
expressing
what
was
meant
to
be
admiration
and
approval
it
is
ramshackle
any
way
said
ruby
it
one
of
the
strongest
built
places
far
or
near
if
i
were
a
man
and
a
soldier
as
i
mean
to
be
said
bertrand
boastfully
i
like
to
cannonade
it
you
see
how
it
come
toppling
over
you
would
like
to
see
it
i
should
think
said
mavis
it
been
the
home
of
your
grandfathers
just
as
much
as
of
ours
do
you
know
your
mother
is
our
father
sister
bertrand
stared
at
her
what
does
it
matter
about
old
rubbishing
grandfathers
and
stuff
like
that
he
said
that
was
what
that
began
saying
about
the
castle
as
if
it
was
any
business
of
his
yes
indeed
said
ruby
he
far
too
fond
of
giving
his
opinion
she
nodded
her
head
mysteriously
we
have
a
talk
about
him
afterwards
bertrand
ruby
began
mavis
in
distress
but
ruby
pushed
her
aside
mind
your
own
business
she
said
more
rudely
than
mavis
had
ever
heard
her
speak
it
all
bertrand
said
mavis
to
herself
feeling
ready
to
cry
sure
they
are
going
to
plan
some
very
naughty
unkind
thing
they
were
on
their
way
up
the
now
the
west
turret
they
had
already
explored
the
other
side
suddenly
a
strange
feeling
came
over
mavis
she
had
not
been
in
this
part
of
the
castle
since
the
adventure
in
the
grotto
she
said
she
comes
to
the
west
turret
still
thought
the
child
just
as
she
did
when
cousin
hortensia
was
a
little
girl
i
wonder
if
she
only
comes
in
the
night
i
wonder
if
possibly
i
shall
see
her
ever
up
here
if
i
did
i
think
i
would
ask
her
to
stop
bertrand
making
ruby
naughty
i
am
sure
dear
princess
make
anybody
do
anything
she
liked
and
she
could
not
help
having
a
curious
feeling
of
expecting
something
when
ruby
who
was
in
front
threw
open
the
door
this
is
the
room
bertrand
she
said
and
there
was
a
mocking
tone
in
her
voice
at
least
so
mavis
and
cousin
hortensia
believe
cousin
hortensia
can
tell
you
a
wonderful
story
of
a
night
she
spent
here
if
you
care
to
hear
it
bertrand
laughed
contemptuously
i
like
to
see
a
ghost
uncommonly
he
said
it
would
take
a
good
lot
of
them
to
frighten
that
what
i
say
said
ruby
but
the
room
looks
dingy
enough
does
it
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
it
look
so
dingy
before
it
looks
as
if
it
was
full
of
smoke
said
bertrand
sniffing
about
but
yet
i
do
smell
smoke
there
something
strange
mavis
saw
it
too
and
much
more
clearly
than
did
the
others
to
her
the
room
seemed
filled
with
a
soft
blue
haze
far
from
appearing
dingy
as
ruby
said
she
thought
the
vague
cloudiness
beautiful
and
as
she
looked
it
became
plain
to
her
that
the
haze
all
came
from
one
corner
where
it
almost
seemed
to
take
form
to
thicken
and
yet
to
lighten
for
there
was
a
glow
and
radiance
over
there
by
the
window
that
looked
towards
the
setting
sun
that
did
not
come
from
any
outside
gleam
or
brightness
no
indeed
for
the
rain
was
pouring
down
steadily
and
hopelessly
with
dull
pitiless
monotony
from
a
leaden
sky
scarcely
could
you
picture
to
yourself
a
drearier
scene
than
the
unbroken
grey
above
and
unbroken
grey
beneath
which
was
all
there
was
to
be
seen
from
the
castle
that
afternoon
yet
in
mavis
eyes
there
was
a
light
a
reflection
of
something
beautiful
and
sunshiny
as
she
stood
there
gazing
across
the
room
with
an
unspoken
hope
in
her
heart
the
others
did
not
see
the
look
in
her
face
or
they
saw
it
wrong
ruby
especially
strange
to
say
what
are
you
gaping
at
mavis
she
said
you
do
look
so
silly
bertrand
stared
at
her
in
his
turn
she
looks
as
if
she
was
asleep
or
dreaming
he
said
curiously
mavis
rubbed
her
eyes
no
no
she
said
brightly
i
not
and
then
she
tried
to
be
very
kind
and
merry
and
pleasant
to
the
others
she
felt
as
if
somebody
was
watching
and
would
be
pleased
and
bertrand
was
a
little
bit
gentler
and
softer
than
he
had
yet
been
almost
giving
mavis
a
feeling
that
in
some
faint
way
the
sweet
influence
was
over
him
too
but
ruby
was
very
contradictory
she
ran
about
making
fun
of
the
old
furniture
and
mocking
at
miss
hortensia
story
till
she
got
bertrand
to
join
with
her
and
both
began
boasting
and
talking
very
foolishly
worse
than
foolishly
indeed
more
than
once
mavis
caught
words
and
hints
which
filled
her
with
distress
and
anxiety
she
knew
however
that
when
ruby
was
in
this
kind
of
humour
it
was
less
than
useless
to
say
anything
now
above
all
that
she
had
got
bertrand
to
back
her
up
suddenly
the
boy
gave
an
impatient
exclamation
i
hate
this
he
said
it
so
stuffy
and
choky
and
that
smoke
or
mist
has
got
into
my
eyes
and
makes
them
smart
come
along
ruby
do
it
not
stuffy
i
think
it
dreadfully
cold
she
replied
but
sure
i
do
want
to
stay
here
the
mist
quite
gone
not
that
i
ever
saw
any
really
it
was
only
with
the
room
being
shut
up
i
suppose
quite
ready
to
go
let
run
down
and
get
a
good
warm
at
the
fire
and
i
tell
you
something
a
grand
secret
bertrand
chapter
seven
in
the
the
wind
with
the
clouds
is
battling
till
the
shriek
with
fear
they
ran
off
leaving
mavis
alone
in
the
poor
mavis
all
her
happy
and
hopeful
feelings
were
gone
it
is
no
use
she
said
to
herself
i
ca
stop
ruby
bertrand
will
just
make
her
as
naughty
as
himself
oh
i
do
wish
he
had
never
come
all
our
happiness
is
spoilt
and
feeling
very
sorry
for
herself
and
for
every
one
concerned
except
bertrand
towards
whom
i
fear
her
feelings
were
more
of
anger
than
grief
mavis
sat
down
on
one
of
the
capacious
old
chairs
that
stood
beside
her
and
began
to
cry
quietly
suddenly
a
strange
sensation
came
over
her
through
her
rather
she
drew
her
handkerchief
from
her
eyes
and
looked
up
she
to
look
up
and
yes
there
it
was
again
there
were
again
the
wonderful
unforgettable
blue
eyes
so
searching
so
irresistible
so
tender
sweet
and
perfectly
loving
as
they
were
it
was
yet
impossible
to
meet
them
without
a
thrill
and
the
first
thought
that
flashed
through
the
little
girl
was
how
could
i
bear
her
to
look
at
me
if
i
had
been
naughty
naughty
she
had
not
been
but
she
felt
her
cheeks
flush
look
down
she
could
not
as
she
said
to
herself
that
she
was
afraid
she
had
been
the
word
was
taken
out
of
her
thoughts
and
expressed
just
as
she
came
to
it
silly
said
the
clear
soft
voice
silly
little
mavis
what
is
it
all
about
is
everything
going
wrong
at
the
first
trial
then
as
mavis
gazed
the
mist
grew
firmer
and
less
vague
and
gradually
the
lovely
form
and
features
became
distinct
oh
dear
princess
said
the
child
i
am
glad
you
have
come
yes
i
daresay
i
am
silly
but
i
am
so
unhappy
and
she
poured
out
all
her
troubles
i
shall
not
be
unhappy
any
more
she
ended
up
now
i
know
you
are
i
had
almost
begun
to
fancy
you
were
all
a
dream
smiled
but
for
a
moment
or
two
she
did
not
speak
then
she
said
what
is
it
you
are
afraid
of
ruby
doing
ruby
and
bertrand
playing
some
unkind
trick
on
winfried
replied
mavis
eagerly
or
even
worse
for
ruby
knows
that
would
hurt
him
most
on
his
old
grandfather
it
would
be
so
horrid
so
and
mavis
voice
grew
tearful
again
when
they
have
been
so
kind
to
us
oh
dear
princess
will
you
stop
them
looked
at
her
gravely
my
child
she
said
do
they
not
it
would
be
wrong
to
do
such
a
thing
yes
mavis
replied
of
course
they
do
then
how
could
i
stop
them
i
mean
to
say
what
would
be
the
good
of
stopping
them
if
they
know
already
it
is
wrong
said
the
princess
mavis
looked
puzzled
but
if
if
they
were
to
hurt
or
frighten
old
adam
or
winfried
she
said
smiled
again
ah
yes
she
said
i
can
promise
you
shall
not
be
but
beyond
that
if
it
is
in
their
hearts
wilfully
to
do
what
they
know
to
be
wrong
i
fear
little
mavis
i
fear
they
must
do
it
and
perhaps
learn
thereby
when
people
mavis
eyes
told
that
she
understood
she
looked
very
grave
but
still
somewhat
relieved
i
am
glad
you
wo
let
it
hurt
winfried
or
his
grandfather
she
said
but
oh
i
ca
bear
ruby
to
be
made
naughty
by
that
horrid
boy
and
she
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
dear
princess
she
went
on
could
you
speak
to
her
the
way
you
do
to
me
you
make
me
feel
that
i
would
i
would
do
you
told
me
dear
child
ruby
can
not
hear
me
yet
she
can
not
see
me
if
she
could
she
would
feel
as
you
be
patient
mavis
love
her
as
you
have
always
done
that
will
not
be
difficult
but
that
is
not
all
you
must
try
to
love
bertrand
too
mavis
face
grew
very
long
i
do
think
i
she
said
at
last
but
you
must
sooner
or
later
and
it
may
as
well
be
sooner
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
a
secret
which
perhaps
will
make
it
easier
for
you
i
mean
to
make
him
love
before
i
have
done
with
him
though
he
may
begin
by
hating
me
the
little
girl
looked
very
grave
and
ruby
she
said
i
should
care
most
for
ruby
to
love
you
strange
to
say
eyes
looked
sadder
than
when
she
had
been
talking
of
bertrand
it
may
be
more
difficult
she
murmured
so
low
that
mavis
hardly
caught
the
words
oh
no
dear
princess
she
said
eagerly
ruby
is
anything
like
as
naughty
as
bertrand
you
must
fancy
that
she
just
just
she
does
think
i
know
said
but
that
was
all
and
her
eyes
still
looked
sad
then
she
glanced
round
the
old
room
seemed
like
a
background
to
her
lovely
figure
it
was
like
gazing
at
a
picture
in
a
dark
setting
i
must
go
she
said
and
when
i
go
you
will
be
all
in
the
dark
the
clouds
are
so
heavy
and
the
day
is
getting
on
can
you
find
your
way
all
down
the
stair
alone
mavis
the
others
have
not
thought
about
leaving
you
up
here
alone
i
do
think
i
mind
said
mavis
but
her
voice
was
a
little
tremulous
for
the
corner
where
the
door
was
across
the
room
from
where
stood
loomed
dark
and
gloomy
the
princess
smiled
yes
you
do
dear
do
tell
stories
i
was
only
trying
your
courage
a
tiny
bit
come
here
darling
mavis
crept
nearer
her
nearer
than
she
had
yet
been
i
am
afraid
of
soiling
your
lovely
dress
she
said
my
pinafore
rather
dirty
we
been
playing
all
over
the
dusty
rooms
you
see
then
laughed
her
talking
was
charming
her
smile
was
bewitching
her
grave
sad
looks
were
like
solemn
music
what
words
have
we
left
to
describe
her
laugh
i
can
think
of
none
i
can
only
tell
you
that
it
made
little
mavis
feel
as
if
all
the
birds
in
the
trees
all
the
flowers
in
the
fields
all
the
brooks
and
waterfalls
all
the
happy
joyous
things
in
the
world
had
suddenly
come
together
with
a
shout
no
shout
is
too
loud
and
rough
with
a
warble
and
flutter
of
irrepressible
glee
oh
said
mavis
how
beautiful
it
is
to
hear
you
princess
and
how
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
in
another
moment
she
felt
herself
lifted
up
up
in
the
air
ever
so
far
it
seemed
and
then
cosily
deposited
most
comfortably
on
shoulder
it
was
years
and
years
since
mavis
had
thought
herself
small
enough
to
ride
even
on
her
father
shoulder
great
strong
tall
father
and
the
princess
who
looked
so
slight
and
how
could
she
be
so
strong
yet
the
arms
that
had
lifted
her
strong
strong
and
firm
as
father
nay
stronger
and
the
hand
that
held
her
up
in
her
place
was
so
secure
in
its
gentle
grasp
that
the
little
girl
felt
she
not
fall
and
that
is
a
very
pleasant
feeling
i
can
assure
you
shut
your
eyes
mavis
said
i
am
quick
in
my
movements
you
are
quite
firm
there
now
i
have
thrown
my
scarf
over
you
i
am
going
to
take
you
rather
a
way
i
warn
you
a
soft
whirr
and
rush
where
were
they
out
of
the
window
somehow
they
had
got
for
mavis
felt
the
chilly
air
and
heard
the
swish
of
the
rain
though
strange
to
say
the
chill
seemed
only
a
pleasant
freshness
and
the
raindrops
did
not
touch
her
then
up
up
dear
dear
where
they
off
to
had
suddenly
turned
into
the
old
woman
who
goes
up
to
brush
away
the
cobwebs
in
the
sky
mavis
laughed
as
the
fancy
struck
her
she
did
not
care
not
she
the
higher
the
better
the
faster
they
flew
the
merrier
she
felt
till
at
last
there
came
a
halt
stopped
short
with
a
long
breath
she
exclaimed
i
given
you
a
toss
up
have
i
look
out
mavis
we
come
ever
so
far
peep
out
and
you
see
the
stars
getting
ready
to
bid
you
it
quite
clear
of
course
up
here
above
the
clouds
mavis
opened
her
eyes
and
peeped
out
from
the
folds
of
scarf
which
light
as
it
was
had
yet
a
marvellous
warmth
about
it
clear
i
should
think
it
clear
never
had
mavis
pictured
to
herself
anything
so
beautiful
as
that
evening
sky
up
above
the
clouds
as
the
princess
had
said
i
have
never
seen
it
so
i
can
not
very
well
describe
it
indeed
i
should
be
rather
afraid
to
do
so
on
hearsay
for
i
should
be
sure
to
make
some
mistake
and
to
name
the
wrong
planets
and
constellations
oh
said
mavis
how
nice
it
was
rather
a
stupid
little
word
to
say
but
was
too
understanding
to
mind
look
about
you
well
for
a
minute
or
two
who
knows
when
you
may
have
such
a
chance
again
and
for
a
little
there
was
silence
then
shut
your
eyes
again
dear
and
clasp
me
tight
little
girls
are
apt
to
get
giddy
in
such
circumstances
yes
that
right
the
stars
are
like
your
eyes
said
mavis
then
again
the
soft
rash
a
plunge
downwards
this
time
which
made
mavis
need
no
second
bidding
to
clasp
her
friend
closely
there
came
over
her
a
misty
sleepy
feeling
she
could
not
have
told
exactly
when
they
stopped
she
only
felt
a
sort
of
butterfly
kiss
on
her
eyes
and
a
breath
that
sounded
like
and
then
she
was
standing
in
the
by
the
fire
the
lamp
was
lighted
it
looked
bright
and
cosy
and
mavis
had
never
felt
happier
or
stronger
in
her
life
that
nice
fresh
air
has
brightened
me
up
so
she
said
to
herself
but
her
hands
were
rather
cold
she
went
close
up
to
the
fire
to
warm
them
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
i
wonder
where
ruby
and
bertrand
are
thought
mavis
just
then
she
heard
miss
hortensia
voice
poor
dear
she
was
saying
ruby
how
could
you
be
so
thoughtless
i
must
get
lights
at
once
and
go
and
look
for
her
we
called
and
called
up
the
stair
but
she
did
answer
said
ruby
in
rather
an
ashamed
tone
of
voice
called
repeated
miss
hortensia
why
did
you
it
was
so
dark
when
we
remembered
about
her
and
you
were
afraid
i
suppose
said
her
cousin
really
and
yet
you
would
leave
poor
mavis
all
alone
and
a
great
boy
like
you
bertrand
was
afraid
but
i
was
going
to
bother
to
go
up
all
that
way
she
could
come
down
by
herself
said
master
bertrand
rudely
but
before
miss
hortensia
could
reply
again
mavis
ran
out
here
i
am
dear
cousin
she
said
i
all
right
and
indeed
she
did
look
all
right
as
she
stood
there
sideways
in
the
doorway
the
light
from
the
room
behind
her
falling
on
her
pretty
hair
and
fair
face
the
dear
child
thought
miss
hortensia
no
one
could
say
mavis
as
pretty
as
ruby
now
and
aloud
she
exclaimed
my
darling
where
have
you
been
and
were
you
afraid
up
there
in
the
dark
all
by
yourself
why
did
you
come
with
us
said
ruby
crossly
it
was
all
your
own
fault
i
did
mind
said
mavis
i
only
sorry
cousin
hortensia
was
frightened
i
all
right
you
see
i
was
frightened
about
you
too
grumbled
ruby
was
said
bertrand
with
a
rough
laugh
there
nothing
to
one
up
in
that
dingy
misty
place
that
it
is
misty
exclaimed
miss
hortensia
in
surprise
what
does
the
child
mean
bertrand
will
say
the
turret
was
full
of
blue
smoke
said
ruby
and
that
it
hurt
his
eyes
it
did
said
the
boy
they
smarting
still
mavis
smiled
miss
hortensia
seemed
perplexed
and
rather
anxious
to
change
the
subject
i
do
hope
she
said
that
will
be
fine
so
that
bertrand
and
you
ruby
may
get
rid
of
some
of
your
spirits
i
hope
too
that
it
will
be
fine
said
ruby
meaningly
bertrand
and
i
have
planned
a
very
long
walk
you
need
come
she
went
on
turning
to
mavis
if
you
think
you
be
tired
i
do
get
tired
quicker
than
you
do
said
mavis
quietly
her
heart
sank
within
her
at
ruby
tone
for
though
she
was
glad
to
think
would
prevent
any
harm
to
old
adam
or
winfried
she
did
not
like
to
think
of
ruby
heartlessness
and
folly
and
when
she
glanced
at
bertrand
and
saw
the
smile
on
his
face
it
was
all
she
could
do
to
keep
back
her
tears
all
that
evening
the
rain
kept
pouring
down
in
torrents
and
the
wind
beat
on
the
window
shaking
even
the
heavy
frames
like
a
giant
in
a
fury
determined
to
make
his
way
in
what
a
storm
said
miss
hortensia
more
than
once
with
a
little
shiver
i
can
not
bear
to
think
of
the
poor
souls
at
sea
bertrand
laughed
it
would
be
great
fun
to
see
a
shipwreck
if
one
was
safe
out
of
way
i
would
mind
staying
up
in
that
musty
old
turret
a
whole
afternoon
to
have
a
good
view
even
ruby
was
startled
oh
bertrand
she
said
you
ca
know
what
a
shipwreck
means
if
you
speak
like
that
i
read
stories
of
them
said
the
boy
so
i
should
know
there
was
a
very
slight
touch
of
something
in
his
tone
which
made
mavis
wonder
if
he
really
meant
all
the
naughty
things
he
said
she
glanced
up
at
him
quickly
if
there
ever
were
a
shipwreck
here
she
said
i
know
who
help
and
who
would
bertrand
face
hardened
at
once
that
meant
for
me
he
retorted
for
me
and
that
precious
lout
of
a
friend
of
yours
you
think
him
so
grand
and
brave
ah
well
wait
a
bit
and
see
when
people
do
know
their
proper
place
they
must
be
taught
it
mavis
drew
herself
up
yes
she
said
we
wait
a
bit
and
see
but
it
wo
be
the
sort
of
seeing
you
like
perhaps
you
no
business
to
speak
like
that
said
ruby
i
think
quite
out
of
your
mind
about
that
common
boy
and
his
grandfather
or
else
and
i
should
wonder
if
it
was
that
they
bewitched
you
somehow
she
dropped
her
voice
with
the
last
words
for
she
did
not
want
her
cousin
to
hear
but
miss
hortensia
though
she
was
busily
counting
the
rows
of
her
knitting
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
noticed
the
tone
of
the
children
voices
come
come
my
dears
she
said
no
wrangling
it
would
be
something
quite
new
here
i
do
she
added
to
herself
that
it
will
be
fine
it
is
so
much
better
for
children
when
they
can
get
out
it
very
fine
it
was
almost
impossible
for
the
little
girls
to
believe
that
so
few
hours
before
the
storm
spirits
had
been
indulging
in
their
wild
games
when
they
looked
out
of
their
window
on
to
the
bright
clear
winter
sky
where
scarcely
a
cloud
was
to
be
seen
the
sun
smiling
down
coldly
but
calmly
not
a
breath
of
wind
moving
the
great
on
the
south
side
of
the
castle
yet
looking
a
little
closer
there
were
some
traces
of
the
night
work
the
ground
was
strewn
with
branches
and
the
last
of
the
leaves
had
found
their
way
down
to
their
on
old
mother
earth
brown
lap
in
spite
of
her
anxieties
mavis
could
not
help
her
spirits
rising
what
a
nice
afternoon
ruby
and
i
might
have
had
with
winfried
if
bertrand
had
come
she
thought
ruby
was
all
smiles
and
gaiety
perhaps
mavis
went
on
to
herself
perhaps
she
really
going
to
be
nice
and
good
and
if
we
two
keep
together
we
can
stop
bertrand
being
very
naughty
miss
hortensia
was
anxious
for
them
to
profit
by
the
fine
day
she
had
not
much
faith
in
the
clear
thin
sunshine
lasting
she
said
and
she
shortened
the
lessons
so
that
dinner
might
be
very
early
and
the
afternoon
free
it
was
still
very
bright
and
fine
when
the
three
children
found
themselves
standing
at
the
entrance
of
the
archway
on
the
sea
side
of
the
castle
which
way
shall
we
go
said
mavis
oh
down
to
the
shore
ruby
replied
we
may
she
went
on
with
a
very
slight
glance
in
bertrand
direction
and
a
tone
in
her
voice
which
struck
mavis
oddly
though
she
scarcely
knew
why
we
meet
winfried
yes
said
bertrand
in
an
way
i
told
the
fellow
we
might
be
somewhere
about
if
it
was
fine
and
i
said
he
might
as
well
have
his
boat
ready
i
do
mind
paying
him
for
the
use
of
it
i
any
amount
of
and
he
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
jingling
the
coins
which
were
in
them
mavis
thought
to
herself
that
she
had
never
disliked
him
as
much
as
now
but
she
said
nothing
and
they
all
three
walked
on
the
pathway
soon
became
steep
and
rugged
as
i
have
told
you
ruby
and
mavis
were
accustomed
to
it
and
bertrand
was
a
strong
boy
still
none
of
them
were
agile
and
nimble
as
the
you
should
see
winfried
running
down
here
said
ruby
he
goes
like
a
stag
or
a
chamois
rather
she
glanced
at
bertrand
as
she
spoke
notwithstanding
her
alliance
with
him
there
was
something
in
ruby
nature
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
resist
vexing
him
by
this
little
hit
the
black
look
came
over
the
boy
face
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
muttered
i
not
going
to
rubbish
bertrand
interrupted
ruby
i
never
said
anything
about
winfried
a
it
his
business
to
scramble
about
then
she
went
close
up
to
her
cousin
and
whispered
something
to
him
which
seemed
to
smooth
him
down
though
this
only
made
mavis
more
anxious
and
unhappy
chapter
eight
a
naughty
plan
the
boatie
rows
the
boatie
rows
the
boatie
rows
fu
weel
ewen
they
were
nearly
at
the
cove
when
they
caught
sight
of
a
scarlet
cap
moving
up
and
down
among
the
rocks
there
winfried
cried
mavis
joyfully
she
could
not
help
having
a
feeling
of
safety
when
the
was
with
them
in
spite
of
her
fears
about
the
mischief
the
other
two
were
planning
winfried
winfried
she
called
here
we
are
he
glanced
up
with
his
bright
though
rather
mysterious
smile
i
knew
you
be
coming
he
said
quietly
of
course
you
did
said
bertrand
in
his
rough
rude
way
considering
i
told
you
to
meet
us
here
have
you
got
that
boat
of
yours
ready
yes
said
winfried
and
he
pointed
towards
the
cove
there
sure
enough
was
the
little
boat
bright
and
dainty
the
sun
shining
on
its
pretty
cushions
and
on
the
white
glistening
oars
bertrand
was
running
forward
when
there
came
a
sudden
exclamation
from
ruby
she
had
put
up
her
hand
to
her
neck
oh
my
cross
she
cried
my
little
silver
cross
i
forgot
to
fetch
it
from
the
i
left
it
there
last
night
and
i
meant
to
go
and
get
it
this
morning
and
i
dare
go
on
the
sea
without
it
i
be
drowned
i
know
i
should
be
mavis
looked
at
her
ruby
she
said
i
do
think
you
could
have
left
it
up
there
you
had
no
reason
to
take
it
off
up
there
oh
but
i
did
i
did
said
ruby
i
have
a
trick
of
taking
it
off
the
cord
gets
entangled
in
my
hair
i
know
it
there
i
fetch
it
you
said
bertrand
with
perfectly
astounding
and
he
actually
set
off
up
the
rocky
path
winfried
started
forward
i
will
go
he
said
i
can
run
much
faster
than
he
and
he
hastened
after
bertrand
but
bertrand
had
exerted
himself
unusually
he
was
already
some
way
up
before
winfried
overtook
him
no
he
said
when
winfried
explained
why
he
had
come
i
want
to
go
but
you
may
as
well
come
too
i
want
to
carry
down
my
i
forgotten
it
you
have
got
any
in
the
boat
i
suppose
no
said
winfried
it
would
keep
us
out
too
long
it
too
cold
for
the
little
ladies
and
we
should
have
to
go
too
far
out
to
sea
i
bring
it
all
the
same
said
bertrand
doggedly
so
mind
your
own
business
but
as
winfried
walked
on
beside
him
without
speaking
he
added
more
civilly
you
may
as
well
look
at
it
and
tell
me
if
it
the
right
kind
it
what
my
father
gave
me
i
pretty
sure
it
not
right
said
winfried
the
fishing
here
is
quite
different
to
anything
you
ever
seen
and
any
way
we
can
not
keep
your
cousins
waiting
while
we
look
at
it
they
were
at
the
arched
entrance
by
now
well
then
said
bertrand
you
run
up
and
look
for
the
cross
no
need
for
two
of
us
to
tire
our
legs
i
wait
here
winfried
entered
the
castle
and
after
one
or
two
wrong
turnings
found
himself
on
the
right
stair
he
knew
pretty
exactly
where
he
had
to
go
for
he
had
often
looked
up
at
the
west
turret
from
the
outside
but
just
as
he
got
to
the
door
he
was
overtaken
by
bertrand
who
had
naturally
come
straight
up
without
any
wrong
turnings
what
a
time
you
been
said
bertrand
pushing
in
before
him
now
let
see
where
did
ruby
say
she
left
her
cross
oh
yes
hanging
up
there
she
must
have
stood
on
a
chair
to
reach
it
and
sure
enough
on
a
nail
pretty
high
up
on
the
wall
hung
the
little
ornament
winfried
drew
forward
a
chair
in
another
minute
he
had
reached
down
the
cross
here
it
is
he
said
turning
to
bertrand
but
he
spoke
to
the
air
bertrand
was
gone
winfried
face
flushed
but
he
controlled
himself
he
walked
quietly
to
the
door
and
turned
the
handle
it
did
not
open
it
was
locked
from
the
outside
he
was
a
prisoner
i
knew
something
of
the
kind
would
come
he
said
to
himself
what
will
they
do
now
poor
little
mavis
i
must
trust
her
to
the
princess
but
he
could
not
help
a
feeling
of
bitter
anger
it
was
no
light
punishment
to
the
active
energetic
boy
to
have
to
spend
all
the
bright
afternoon
hours
shut
up
here
like
an
old
owl
in
a
church
tower
and
he
knew
that
till
some
one
came
to
let
him
out
a
prisoner
he
verily
was
for
he
might
have
shouted
his
voice
hoarse
no
one
down
below
could
have
heard
him
and
the
chance
of
any
one
in
the
castle
coming
up
was
very
small
what
will
gran
think
he
said
to
himself
and
if
these
naughty
children
try
to
play
him
any
trick
i
know
ruby
more
than
half
believes
all
that
nonsense
about
his
being
a
wizard
and
about
the
mermaids
and
bertrand
will
egg
her
on
he
went
to
the
window
and
stood
looking
out
trying
to
keep
down
the
dreadful
restless
feeling
which
began
to
come
over
him
how
can
i
bear
it
he
said
if
i
had
tools
now
and
could
pick
the
lock
but
some
of
these
old
locks
are
very
strong
and
i
have
nothing
if
only
i
had
wings
and
he
gazed
again
out
of
the
window
when
he
turned
round
though
it
was
quite
bright
and
sunny
outside
it
almost
seemed
as
if
the
evening
haze
had
somehow
got
into
the
room
before
its
time
it
was
filled
with
a
thin
bluish
mist
eyes
brightened
my
princess
he
exclaimed
are
you
there
a
little
laugh
answered
him
and
gradually
the
mist
drew
together
and
into
shape
and
stood
before
him
my
boy
she
exclaimed
i
am
surprised
at
you
why
you
were
looking
quite
depressed
winfried
reddened
it
was
the
horrid
feeling
of
being
locked
up
he
said
i
never
felt
it
before
and
it
seems
such
a
shame
such
a
mean
trick
i
have
minded
a
fight
with
any
fellow
but
of
course
you
would
but
you
got
a
good
bit
farther
than
i
hope
winfried
she
said
with
a
smile
and
besides
bertrand
is
much
smaller
than
you
but
it
had
to
be
you
know
i
have
explained
enough
to
you
you
and
little
mavis
it
had
to
be
winfried
started
that
another
thing
he
said
i
am
uneasy
about
her
what
will
they
do
they
do
understand
the
boat
you
know
princess
and
she
is
alone
with
them
smiled
again
how
faithless
you
are
winfried
she
said
mavis
will
be
getting
before
you
if
you
do
take
care
simple
and
ignorant
as
she
is
ca
you
trust
her
to
me
and
as
the
boy
face
brightened
come
she
said
i
see
you
are
recovering
your
usual
ground
so
i
will
tell
you
how
i
am
going
to
do
but
first
shut
your
eyes
winfried
and
here
wrap
the
end
of
my
scarf
round
you
you
might
feel
giddy
still
though
it
not
the
first
time
ready
that
right
there
now
give
me
your
hand
we
up
on
the
window
ledge
you
were
wishing
for
wings
is
this
as
good
as
wings
bertrand
rushed
down
as
much
as
he
could
rush
that
is
to
say
over
the
steep
and
rough
path
to
the
shore
where
the
sisters
were
waiting
have
you
got
it
asked
mavis
eagerly
what
asked
bertrand
out
of
breath
why
ruby
cross
of
course
that
you
went
for
and
where
is
winfried
all
right
said
bertrand
in
a
curious
voice
he
coming
directly
we
to
get
into
the
boat
and
go
on
a
little
way
keeping
near
the
shore
he
coming
down
another
way
yes
bertrand
that
he
is
mavis
looked
up
anxiously
and
the
cross
she
said
winfried
got
it
he
said
which
was
true
then
he
turned
away
the
fact
being
that
he
was
so
choking
with
laughter
that
he
was
afraid
of
betraying
himself
ruby
he
called
come
and
help
to
drag
the
boat
a
little
nearer
and
as
ruby
came
close
he
whispered
to
her
i
done
it
splendidly
he
shut
up
in
his
tower
locked
in
and
the
locks
are
good
strong
ones
now
we
can
have
a
jolly
good
spree
without
that
prig
of
a
fellow
only
do
let
mavis
know
till
we
safe
out
in
the
boat
ruby
jumped
with
pleasure
what
fun
she
exclaimed
how
capital
you
have
been
clever
bertrand
but
take
care
or
mavis
will
suspect
something
quick
mavis
she
went
on
turning
to
her
sister
help
us
to
pull
in
the
boat
there
we
can
jump
in
now
bertrand
you
and
mavis
steady
it
while
i
spring
and
in
another
moment
she
was
in
the
boat
where
her
sister
and
bertrand
soon
followed
her
all
seemed
well
the
sky
was
clear
and
bright
the
sun
still
shining
the
faces
of
two
of
the
party
were
sparkling
with
glee
and
triumph
but
mavis
looked
frightened
and
dissatisfied
i
wish
winfried
had
come
back
with
you
bertrand
she
said
why
did
he
did
cousin
hortensia
keep
him
for
anything
goodness
no
said
bertrand
what
a
fuss
you
make
child
he
all
right
you
can
look
out
for
him
and
tell
me
if
you
see
him
coming
i
shall
have
enough
to
do
with
rowing
you
two
winfried
does
find
the
boat
hard
to
row
said
mavis
it
your
own
fault
if
it
is
hard
you
might
as
well
wait
for
him
he
see
us
as
he
comes
down
the
cliffs
oh
no
that
would
be
nonsense
said
ruby
hastily
besides
he
not
coming
that
way
you
heard
bertrand
say
so
could
row
too
bertrand
she
went
on
but
the
boy
had
already
got
his
oars
in
motion
and
though
he
was
neither
skilful
nor
experienced
strange
to
say
the
little
boat
glided
on
with
the
utmost
ease
and
smoothness
there
now
said
bertrand
considerably
surprised
to
tell
the
truth
at
his
own
success
did
i
tell
you
i
could
row
no
said
mavis
bluntly
you
said
just
this
moment
you
have
enough
to
do
to
manage
it
mavis
why
are
you
so
cross
said
ruby
it
is
such
a
pity
to
spoil
everything
she
spoke
very
smoothly
and
almost
coaxingly
but
mavis
looked
her
straight
in
the
eyes
and
ruby
grew
uncomfortable
and
turned
away
but
just
then
a
new
misgiving
struck
mavis
bertrand
she
cried
either
you
ca
manage
the
boat
or
doing
it
on
purpose
you
not
keeping
near
the
shore
as
you
said
you
would
you
going
right
out
to
sea
and
she
jumped
up
as
if
she
would
have
snatched
the
oars
from
him
sit
down
mavis
said
ruby
i
sure
you
know
you
should
never
jump
about
in
a
boat
it
all
right
do
you
know
there
there
a
current
hereabouts
current
or
no
there
was
besides
bertrand
rowing
that
was
rapidly
carrying
them
away
farther
and
farther
from
the
shore
mavis
looked
at
bertrand
not
sure
whether
he
could
help
himself
or
not
but
winfried
would
have
told
you
to
keep
near
the
shore
if
you
could
she
said
he
knows
all
about
the
currents
bertrand
turned
with
a
rude
laugh
does
he
indeed
he
said
it
more
than
i
do
but
all
the
same
this
current
or
whatever
it
is
that
is
taking
us
out
so
fast
has
come
just
at
the
right
minute
i
never
meant
to
keep
near
in
there
no
fun
in
that
we
going
a
jolly
good
way
out
and
when
we
tired
of
it
we
come
back
and
land
close
to
the
old
wizard
cottage
ruby
and
i
are
going
to
play
him
a
trick
we
want
to
catch
him
with
the
mermaids
ruby
heard
singing
the
other
day
if
we
set
the
villagers
on
him
they
soon
make
an
end
of
him
and
his
precious
grandson
yes
said
ruby
spitefully
and
a
good
riddance
they
be
that
winfried
setting
himself
up
over
us
all
mavis
grew
pale
ruby
bertrand
she
said
you
can
not
mean
to
be
so
wicked
you
know
the
villagers
are
already
set
against
old
adam
rather
even
though
he
has
been
so
good
to
them
and
if
you
stir
them
up
they
might
kill
him
if
they
really
thought
he
was
a
wizard
we
not
going
to
do
anything
till
we
know
for
ourselves
said
ruby
we
first
going
to
the
cottage
really
to
find
out
if
it
true
you
know
yourself
mavis
we
hear
some
one
singing
and
speaking
there
the
other
day
who
was
to
be
seen
when
we
got
there
and
i
believe
it
a
mermaid
or
or
a
syren
or
some
witchy
sort
of
creature
mavis
was
silent
she
had
her
own
thoughts
about
the
voice
they
had
overheard
thoughts
which
she
could
not
share
with
the
others
oh
dear
princess
she
said
to
her
self
why
do
you
make
them
see
you
and
understand
how
naughty
they
are
for
the
moment
she
had
forgotten
the
princess
promise
that
neither
winfried
nor
his
grandfather
should
suffer
any
harm
and
she
felt
terribly
frightened
and
unhappy
where
is
winfried
she
said
at
last
he
will
see
us
going
out
to
sea
when
he
comes
down
to
the
shore
and
if
he
tells
cousin
hortensia
she
can
easily
get
some
of
the
fishermen
to
come
after
us
they
can
row
far
quicker
than
you
bertrand
stopped
rowing
to
laugh
more
rudely
than
before
they
he
said
i
doubt
it
and
as
for
winfried
telling
why
he
does
know
he
locked
in
safe
and
sound
in
the
west
turret
he
be
quite
comfortable
there
for
as
long
as
i
choose
to
leave
him
and
however
he
shouts
no
one
can
hear
him
not
that
there
much
fear
of
any
of
those
lumbering
boats
overtaking
us
if
they
tried
why
he
took
up
the
oars
again
as
he
spoke
but
before
he
began
to
row
he
half
started
and
glanced
round
no
wonder
the
boat
was
gliding
out
to
sea
without
his
help
quite
as
fast
as
when
he
was
rowing
how
how
it
drifts
he
said
in
a
rather
queer
tone
of
voice
is
there
a
current
hereabouts
ruby
i
suppose
so
said
ruby
try
and
row
the
other
way
that
soon
show
you
but
it
was
all
very
well
to
speak
of
trying
no
efforts
of
had
the
very
slightest
effect
on
the
boat
on
it
sped
faster
and
faster
as
if
laughing
at
him
dancing
along
the
water
as
if
it
were
alive
and
enjoying
the
joke
bertrand
grew
angry
then
by
degrees
frightened
it
is
my
fault
he
said
i
do
pretend
to
know
all
about
the
currents
and
tides
and
nonsense
you
should
have
let
me
come
out
here
ruby
ruby
was
terrified
but
angry
too
it
is
fault
she
said
you
planned
it
all
you
know
you
did
and
if
we
all
be
quiet
ruby
said
mavis
who
alone
of
the
three
was
perfectly
calm
and
composed
if
it
stops
you
and
bertrand
carrying
out
your
naughty
plan
i
am
very
glad
if
we
are
taken
out
to
sea
that
bad
of
you
said
ruby
angry
in
spite
of
her
terror
i
believe
you
rather
we
were
drowned
than
that
your
precious
winfried
and
his
grandfather
should
get
what
they
deserve
and
we
going
to
be
drowned
or
any
way
starved
to
death
we
going
faster
and
faster
oh
i
do
believe
there
must
be
a
whirlpool
somewhere
near
here
and
that
we
are
going
to
be
sucked
into
it
she
began
to
sob
and
cry
bertrand
to
do
him
justice
put
a
good
face
upon
it
he
looked
pale
but
determined
this
is
what
comes
of
having
to
do
with
people
like
that
he
said
vindictively
i
believe
he
bewitched
the
boat
to
spite
us
have
another
try
however
but
it
was
all
no
use
the
boat
slight
and
fragile
as
it
seemed
resisted
his
efforts
as
if
it
were
a
living
thing
opposing
him
crimson
with
heat
and
vexation
the
boy
muttered
some
words
which
it
was
to
be
hoped
the
girls
did
not
catch
and
flung
down
the
oars
in
a
rage
one
fell
inside
the
other
was
just
slipping
over
the
edge
when
mavis
caught
it
strange
to
say
no
sooner
was
it
in
her
hold
than
the
motion
stopped
the
boat
lay
still
and
passive
on
the
water
swaying
gently
as
if
waiting
for
orders
we
got
out
of
the
current
exclaimed
ruby
try
mavis
can
you
turn
it
it
hardly
seemed
to
need
trying
the
boat
turned
almost
as
it
were
of
itself
and
in
another
moment
they
were
quietly
moving
towards
the
shore
nor
did
it
seem
to
make
any
difference
when
bertrand
took
the
oars
from
mavis
and
resumed
his
rowing
if
i
only
waited
another
moment
he
said
we
got
out
of
the
current
just
as
you
caught
the
oar
mavis
she
shook
her
head
doubtfully
i
do
know
i
do
think
it
was
that
she
said
but
any
way
now
it
is
all
right
again
and
we
are
going
back
you
and
bertrand
ruby
will
not
think
of
playing
any
trick
or
setting
the
villagers
on
to
old
adam
why
not
pray
said
bertrand
and
i
do
see
what
has
made
any
difference
said
ruby
pertly
suppose
the
horrid
things
had
bewitched
the
boat
is
that
any
reason
for
not
showing
them
up
you
think
it
all
your
wonderful
cleverness
that
got
the
boat
round
do
you
mavis
no
i
do
i
think
a
good
many
things
i
not
going
to
tell
you
said
the
little
girl
but
one
thing
i
will
tell
you
will
not
leave
the
boat
or
come
on
shore
unless
you
promise
me
to
give
up
your
naughty
cruel
plan
she
spoke
so
firmly
that
ruby
was
startled
and
indeed
her
own
words
seemed
to
surprise
mavis
herself
it
was
as
if
some
one
were
whispering
to
her
what
to
say
but
on
bertrand
they
made
no
impression
you
wo
wo
you
he
said
ah
well
we
see
to
that
they
were
close
to
the
shore
by
this
time
the
marvellous
boat
had
got
over
the
ground
i
was
going
to
say
i
mean
the
even
more
quickly
than
when
going
out
to
sea
and
in
another
minute
thanks
to
something
no
doubt
bertrand
thought
it
was
thanks
to
his
wonderful
skill
they
glided
quietly
into
the
little
where
winfried
had
brought
them
two
days
ago
up
jumped
ruby
that
capital
she
said
we
can
easily
make
out
way
to
the
old
wizard
cottage
from
here
and
before
we
peep
in
on
him
himself
bertrand
we
may
as
well
look
round
his
garden
as
he
calls
it
it
is
the
queerest
place
you
ever
saw
full
of
caves
and
grottoes
both
bertrand
and
she
had
jumped
on
shore
come
on
mavis
cried
they
what
are
you
so
slow
about
for
mavis
sat
perfectly
still
in
her
place
i
am
not
coming
on
shore
she
said
quietly
not
unless
you
promise
to
give
up
whatever
mischief
it
is
that
you
are
planning
nonsense
said
bertrand
you
just
come
tell
her
she
must
ruby
you
the
eldest
come
mavis
said
ruby
you
better
come
for
everybody
sake
i
can
tell
you
she
added
meaningly
if
you
there
you
can
look
after
your
precious
old
wizard
i
wo
promise
anything
no
mavis
repeated
i
will
not
come
we
have
no
right
to
go
forcing
ourselves
into
his
cottage
it
is
as
much
his
as
the
castle
is
ours
and
you
know
you
have
locked
up
winfried
on
purpose
so
that
he
ca
get
out
no
i
will
not
go
with
you
then
stay
shouted
bertrand
and
take
the
consequences
and
he
dragged
ruby
back
from
the
boat
chapter
nine
beginnings
very
wrong
very
wrong
very
wrong
and
bad
let
run
on
fast
a
little
way
said
bertrand
to
make
her
think
we
wo
wait
for
her
that
will
frighten
her
and
she
will
run
after
us
you
see
do
look
round
ruby
in
his
heart
he
really
did
not
believe
that
mavis
would
change
her
mind
or
run
after
them
and
he
did
not
care
indeed
he
much
preferred
having
ruby
alone
as
he
knew
he
could
far
more
easily
persuade
her
by
herself
to
join
in
his
mischievous
schemes
but
he
felt
that
she
was
about
leaving
her
sister
and
so
he
did
not
hesitate
to
trick
her
too
they
hurried
on
for
some
distance
then
ruby
who
was
growing
both
tired
and
cross
pulled
her
hand
away
from
bertrand
stop
she
said
i
quite
out
of
breath
and
i
want
to
see
if
mavis
is
coming
bertrand
had
to
give
in
they
were
on
higher
ground
than
the
shore
and
could
see
it
clearly
there
lay
the
little
boat
as
they
had
left
it
and
mavis
sitting
in
it
calmly
to
all
appearance
at
least
she
not
coming
not
a
bit
of
her
exclaimed
ruby
angrily
i
believe
you
thought
she
would
bertrand
she
come
you
see
said
the
boy
and
even
if
she
does
what
does
it
matter
we
run
on
and
spy
out
the
old
wizard
and
have
some
fun
mavis
will
stay
there
safe
enough
till
we
get
back
i
thought
you
meant
to
go
home
by
the
village
and
tell
the
people
about
old
adam
if
we
see
anything
queer
said
ruby
so
i
did
but
if
you
in
such
a
fidget
about
mavis
perhaps
better
go
home
as
we
came
and
not
say
anything
in
the
village
i
like
to
see
what
master
winfried
has
been
up
to
when
we
get
back
perhaps
he
have
got
some
old
witch
to
lend
him
a
broomstick
and
we
shall
find
him
flown
and
bertrand
laughed
scornfully
ruby
laughed
too
i
do
think
that
likely
she
said
but
there
no
telling
i
do
wish
he
and
his
grandfather
were
out
of
the
country
altogether
something
about
winfried
that
makes
me
feel
furious
he
such
a
prig
and
he
even
got
cousin
hortensia
to
think
him
a
piece
of
perfection
he
may
take
his
perfections
elsewhere
and
he
shall
too
said
bertrand
and
the
fierceness
of
his
tone
almost
startled
even
ruby
they
were
not
far
from
the
old
fisherman
cottage
by
this
time
they
stopped
again
to
take
breath
mavis
and
the
boat
were
not
visible
from
where
they
stood
for
the
path
went
in
and
out
among
the
rocks
and
just
here
some
large
projecting
boulders
hid
the
shore
from
sight
suddenly
as
if
it
came
from
some
cave
beneath
their
feet
both
children
grew
conscious
of
a
faint
sound
as
of
distant
music
and
every
moment
it
became
clearer
and
louder
even
though
muffled
bertrand
and
ruby
looked
at
each
other
mermaids
both
exclaimed
they
always
sing
said
bertrand
yes
added
ruby
with
her
old
confusion
of
ideas
about
syrens
and
they
make
people
go
after
them
by
their
singing
and
then
they
catch
them
and
kill
them
and
i
not
sure
but
what
they
them
i
know
i
read
something
about
bare
dry
bones
being
found
shall
we
put
our
fingers
in
our
ears
bertrand
she
looked
quite
pale
with
fear
nonsense
said
the
boy
that
only
sailors
at
sea
they
lure
them
in
among
the
rocks
we
quite
safe
on
dry
land
besides
i
think
it
that
do
that
they
miserable
crying
creatures
but
i
do
think
they
kill
people
the
subterraneous
music
came
nearer
and
nearer
somehow
the
children
could
not
listening
did
you
say
you
and
mavis
heard
singing
the
day
you
were
here
before
at
the
wizard
cottage
i
mean
said
bertrand
not
exactly
singing
it
was
laughing
and
a
voice
calling
out
in
a
singing
way
answered
ruby
as
if
in
response
to
her
words
the
ringing
suddenly
stopped
and
from
below
their
feet
precisely
below
it
seemed
came
the
sound
of
ringing
silvery
laughter
clear
and
unmistakable
oh
cried
ruby
come
away
bertrand
i
sure
it
the
mermaids
and
they
catch
us
and
kill
us
you
see
her
boasted
courage
had
not
come
to
much
and
yet
there
was
nothing
very
alarming
in
the
pretty
sounds
they
had
heard
and
what
if
it
is
the
mermaids
said
bertrand
coolly
we
came
out
to
catch
them
did
we
it
just
what
we
wanted
come
along
ruby
how
do
we
get
to
the
cottage
there
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
wall
in
front
we
go
round
by
the
back
said
ruby
it
there
there
are
the
queer
grottoes
and
little
caves
but
you
wo
go
far
into
them
will
you
bertrand
for
i
am
not
at
all
sure
but
that
the
mermaids
come
up
from
the
sea
through
these
caves
you
see
they
come
some
underground
way
bertrand
gave
a
sort
of
grunt
what
ruby
said
only
made
him
the
more
determined
to
explore
as
far
as
he
possibly
could
they
entered
the
strange
little
garden
i
have
already
described
without
further
adventure
there
seemed
no
one
about
no
sound
of
any
kind
broke
the
almost
unnatural
stillness
how
quiet
it
is
said
ruby
with
a
little
shiver
and
no
smoke
coming
out
of
the
chimney
there
was
the
last
time
for
there
was
a
good
fire
in
the
kitchen
where
old
adam
was
and
as
she
said
this
there
came
over
her
the
remembrance
of
the
kind
old
man
gentle
hospitality
and
interest
in
them
why
had
she
taken
such
a
hatred
to
winfried
and
his
grandfather
especially
since
arrival
she
could
not
have
given
any
real
reason
i
hope
he
is
very
ill
or
she
said
dropping
her
voice
and
winfried
locked
up
and
not
able
to
get
to
him
it
would
be
our
fault
bertrand
nonsense
said
bertrand
roughly
with
his
usual
scornful
contempt
of
any
softer
feelings
he
fallen
asleep
over
his
pipe
and
glass
of
grog
i
daresay
he
drinks
lots
of
grog
those
fellows
always
do
i
sure
does
contradicted
ruby
feeling
angry
with
herself
as
well
as
bertrand
let
go
to
the
window
and
peep
in
before
we
look
at
the
caves
she
ran
round
to
the
front
followed
by
her
cousin
taking
care
to
make
as
little
sound
as
possible
she
remembered
on
which
side
of
the
door
was
the
kitchen
and
softly
approached
what
she
knew
must
be
its
window
but
how
surprised
she
was
when
she
looked
in
it
was
the
kitchen
she
remembered
the
shape
of
the
room
she
recognised
the
neat
little
fireplace
but
all
was
completely
deserted
every
trace
of
furniture
had
disappeared
old
adam
large
chair
by
the
hearth
might
never
have
been
in
existence
well
as
she
remembered
it
except
that
it
was
clean
and
swept
the
room
might
not
have
been
inhabited
for
years
ruby
turned
to
bertrand
who
was
staring
in
at
another
window
i
say
ruby
he
whispered
the
room
over
here
is
quite
i
know
she
said
so
is
the
kitchen
they
gone
bertrand
quite
gone
and
we
had
all
our
trouble
for
nothing
it
too
bad
repeated
bertrand
you
ca
say
when
you
know
that
winfried
is
locked
up
in
the
oh
exclaimed
ruby
starting
i
quite
forgot
he
must
have
hidden
his
grandfather
somewhere
and
yet
i
do
see
how
they
could
have
managed
it
so
quietly
we
always
know
when
any
of
the
village
people
are
moving
their
furniture
they
send
to
borrow
our
carts
well
said
bertrand
there
one
thing
certain
if
you
believe
it
before
you
must
now
i
should
think
even
mavis
would
the
old
fellow
a
wizard
and
so
his
precious
grandson
shall
we
go
into
the
house
said
ruby
though
she
looked
half
afraid
to
do
so
is
the
door
locked
said
bertrand
trying
it
as
he
spoke
it
yielded
to
his
touch
he
went
in
followed
though
tremblingly
by
ruby
but
after
all
there
was
little
or
nothing
to
see
the
three
rooms
though
scrupulously
clean
even
the
windows
shining
bright
and
polished
were
perfectly
empty
as
the
children
strolled
back
to
the
kitchen
annoyed
and
disappointed
feeling
to
tell
the
truth
rather
small
something
caught
ruby
eye
in
one
corner
of
the
room
it
was
a
small
object
gleaming
bright
and
blue
on
the
white
stones
of
the
floor
she
ran
forward
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
tiny
bunch
of
tied
with
a
scrap
of
ribbon
the
same
large
brilliant
kind
of
as
those
which
she
and
mavis
had
so
admired
on
their
first
visit
to
the
now
deserted
cottage
she
gave
a
little
cry
look
bertrand
she
said
they
ca
have
been
long
gone
these
flowers
are
quite
fresh
i
wonder
where
they
came
from
they
must
have
been
growing
in
a
pot
in
the
house
for
there
are
none
in
the
garden
i
looked
as
we
came
through
bertrand
glanced
at
the
flowers
carelessly
wizards
he
began
can
but
his
sentence
was
never
finished
for
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
sudden
gust
of
wind
down
the
wide
chimney
so
loud
and
furious
that
it
was
as
startling
as
a
clap
of
thunder
then
it
subsided
again
but
for
a
moment
or
two
a
long
low
wail
sounded
overhead
gradually
dying
away
in
the
distance
what
was
that
said
bertrand
while
the
sounds
lasted
both
children
had
stood
perfectly
still
the
wind
of
course
said
ruby
she
was
more
accustomed
than
her
cousin
to
the
unexpected
vagaries
of
the
storm
spirits
so
near
the
sea
still
even
she
seemed
startled
it
often
like
that
she
was
beginning
to
say
but
she
hesitated
it
very
loud
she
added
there
must
be
rough
weather
coming
said
bertrand
we
better
go
home
by
the
road
i
think
ruby
exclaimed
ruby
indignantly
do
you
mean
you
and
me
bertrand
and
what
about
mavis
she
can
come
on
shore
replied
the
boy
carelessly
she
knows
where
we
are
it
her
own
fault
come
along
there
nothing
to
wait
for
in
this
empty
old
hole
i
want
you
to
show
me
the
caves
outside
i
try
to
signal
to
mavis
first
said
ruby
i
tie
my
handkerchief
to
a
stick
and
wave
it
about
she
can
see
us
up
here
quite
well
and
perhaps
when
she
finds
we
alone
she
come
they
left
the
cottage
and
ruby
got
out
her
handkerchief
but
it
was
small
use
for
just
as
they
stepped
on
to
the
rough
little
terrace
in
front
from
whence
they
could
clearly
see
the
shore
there
came
another
and
even
it
seemed
so
at
least
now
they
were
standing
outside
more
violent
blast
it
was
all
ruby
could
do
to
keep
her
feet
and
when
she
recovered
from
the
giddying
effect
of
the
wind
she
was
still
breathless
and
shaken
and
that
the
hurricane
was
gathering
strength
every
second
was
plain
to
be
seen
the
waves
were
dashing
in
excitedly
the
sky
at
one
side
had
that
strange
lurid
purple
colour
which
foretells
great
disturbance
but
it
was
not
these
things
only
which
made
ruby
turn
pale
and
shiver
bertrand
she
gasped
i
do
know
if
there
something
the
matter
with
my
eyes
i
ca
see
clearly
bertrand
look
where
is
mavis
mavis
and
the
boat
can
you
see
them
bertrand
shaded
his
brow
with
his
hand
and
gazed
my
soul
he
said
it
very
odd
ca
see
them
and
there
not
been
time
for
mavis
to
have
rowed
out
to
sea
or
even
to
have
drifted
out
we
can
see
right
out
ever
so
far
and
there
no
boat
not
a
sign
of
one
can
can
she
have
landed
and
dragged
the
boat
ashore
somehow
said
ruby
her
teeth
chattering
with
cold
and
fear
no
said
bertrand
we
certainly
see
her
and
the
boat
in
that
case
then
where
is
she
cried
ruby
you
must
care
what
do
you
think
has
become
of
her
ca
say
i
sure
said
the
boy
the
boat
may
have
capsized
the
sea
awfully
rough
now
do
you
mean
that
mavis
may
be
drowned
or
drowning
screamed
ruby
she
had
to
scream
even
had
she
been
less
terribly
excited
for
the
roar
of
wind
was
on
them
again
and
her
voice
was
scarcely
audible
i
do
see
that
she
need
be
drowned
said
bertrand
it
shallow
she
have
crept
on
shore
and
be
lying
somewhere
among
those
big
stones
and
if
not
ca
your
precious
wizard
friends
look
after
her
she
fond
enough
of
them
he
was
partly
in
earnest
but
ruby
took
it
all
as
cruel
heartless
mocking
she
turned
upon
him
furiously
you
a
brutal
wicked
boy
she
screamed
i
wish
you
were
drowned
i
wish
you
had
never
come
near
us
i
wish
she
stopped
choked
by
her
fury
and
misery
and
by
the
wind
which
came
tearing
round
again
bertrand
came
close
to
her
as
you
so
busy
wishing
he
called
into
her
ear
you
better
wish
you
had
done
what
you
have
done
yourself
it
was
all
you
who
started
the
plan
and
settled
how
we
were
to
trick
winfried
into
the
you
know
you
did
and
did
i
plan
to
drown
mavis
my
own
darling
little
sister
returned
ruby
as
well
as
she
could
speak
between
her
sobs
and
breathlessness
come
down
to
the
shore
with
me
this
moment
and
help
me
to
look
for
her
if
you
not
altogether
a
cruel
heartless
bully
not
i
said
bertrand
we
probably
get
drowned
ourselves
just
see
how
the
waves
come
leaping
in
they
look
as
if
they
were
alive
i
believe
it
all
witches
work
together
i
not
going
to
trust
myself
down
there
come
and
show
me
the
grottoes
and
the
caves
ruby
we
may
as
well
shelter
in
them
till
the
wind
goes
down
a
bit
we
ca
do
mavis
any
good
if
she
on
the
shore
she
can
take
care
of
herself
and
if
she
under
the
water
ca
reach
her
and
he
caught
hold
of
ruby
to
pull
her
along
but
she
tore
herself
from
his
grasp
with
a
wrench
you
wicked
you
heartless
brutal
boy
she
cried
i
do
care
if
i
am
drowned
i
would
rather
be
drowned
with
mavis
than
stay
alive
with
you
and
almost
before
bertrand
knew
what
she
was
doing
ruby
was
rushing
through
the
little
garden
at
the
back
of
the
cottage
on
her
way
to
descend
the
rough
path
to
the
shore
he
stood
looking
after
her
coolly
for
a
moment
or
two
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
tried
to
whistle
but
it
was
not
very
successful
the
wind
had
the
best
of
it
i
do
believe
mavis
has
come
to
any
harm
he
said
aloud
though
speaking
to
himself
and
almost
as
if
trying
to
excuse
his
own
conduct
anyway
i
do
see
that
it
my
business
to
look
after
her
it
was
all
her
own
obstinacy
he
kicked
roughly
at
the
pebbles
at
his
feet
and
as
he
did
so
his
glance
fell
on
a
tiny
speck
of
colour
just
where
he
was
kicking
it
was
one
of
the
blue
flowers
ruby
had
found
in
the
cottage
bertrand
stooped
and
picked
it
up
and
strange
to
say
he
handled
it
gently
but
as
he
looked
at
it
there
came
again
to
him
the
queer
smarting
pain
in
his
eyes
which
he
had
complained
of
in
the
and
glancing
up
he
became
aware
that
the
wind
had
suddenly
gone
down
everything
had
become
almost
unnaturally
still
while
a
thin
bluish
haze
seemed
gathering
closely
round
where
he
stood
bertrand
rubbed
his
eyes
there
ca
be
smoke
here
he
said
what
can
be
the
matter
with
my
eyes
and
he
rubbed
them
impatiently
it
did
no
good
no
that
will
do
no
good
said
a
voice
it
seemed
quite
near
him
look
up
and
in
spite
of
himself
the
boy
could
not
help
looking
up
he
screamed
what
is
it
what
is
it
for
an
agony
short
but
indescribable
had
darted
through
his
eyeballs
piercing
it
seemed
to
him
to
his
very
brain
and
bertrand
was
not
in
some
ways
a
cowardly
boy
there
was
silence
perfect
dead
silence
and
gradually
the
intense
aching
which
the
short
terrible
pain
had
left
began
to
subside
as
it
did
so
and
bertrand
ventured
to
look
up
again
he
saw
that
what
he
had
seen
he
could
not
describe
it
better
was
gone
the
haze
had
disappeared
the
air
was
again
clear
but
far
from
still
for
round
the
corner
of
the
old
cottage
the
blast
now
came
rushing
and
tearing
as
if
infuriated
at
having
been
for
a
moment
obliged
to
keep
back
and
with
it
now
came
the
rain
such
rain
as
the
boy
had
never
seen
before
blinding
drenching
lashing
rain
whose
drops
seemed
to
cut
and
sting
with
such
force
did
they
fall
it
added
to
his
confusion
and
bewilderment
like
a
hunted
animal
he
turned
and
ran
anywhere
to
get
shelter
and
soon
he
found
himself
behind
the
house
and
then
the
thought
of
the
grottoes
the
little
girls
had
told
him
of
returned
to
his
mind
i
wo
go
back
into
that
witches
hole
he
said
to
himself
as
he
glanced
back
at
the
house
i
shelter
in
one
of
the
grottoes
as
he
thought
this
he
caught
sight
of
an
opening
in
the
rockery
before
him
it
was
the
entrance
to
the
very
cave
where
mavis
had
been
left
by
ruby
bertrand
ran
in
what
happened
to
him
there
you
shall
hear
in
good
time
chapter
ten
land
a
world
where
the
month
is
always
june
ruby
meanwhile
was
running
or
rather
stumbling
down
the
stones
she
cried
and
sobbed
as
she
went
her
pretty
face
had
never
i
think
looked
so
woebegone
and
forlorn
for
it
was
new
to
her
to
be
really
distressed
or
anxious
about
anything
mavis
mavis
she
called
out
every
now
and
then
are
you
there
darling
ca
you
answer
as
if
even
had
the
wind
been
less
wildly
raging
mavis
could
possibly
have
heard
her
so
and
before
long
ruby
was
obliged
to
stop
for
a
moment
to
gather
strength
and
breath
the
wind
seemed
to
increase
every
minute
she
turned
her
back
to
it
for
a
second
the
relief
was
immense
and
just
then
she
noticed
that
she
was
still
clutching
the
little
bunch
of
flowers
she
had
picked
up
they
made
her
begin
to
cry
again
mavis
loves
them
so
she
thought
and
her
memory
went
back
to
the
happy
peaceful
afternoon
they
had
spent
with
old
adam
and
his
grandson
how
kind
they
were
and
how
nice
the
cakes
were
that
winfried
had
made
for
them
himself
oh
thought
ruby
i
wish
bertrand
had
never
come
it
all
but
there
she
hesitated
there
had
been
truth
in
her
cousin
mean
reproach
that
the
mischief
and
the
cruel
tricks
they
had
planned
had
been
first
thought
of
by
and
ruby
knew
too
in
her
heart
that
she
had
not
been
gentle
or
unselfish
or
kind
long
before
she
had
ever
seen
bertrand
she
had
not
been
so
actively
naughty
because
she
had
had
no
chance
of
being
so
as
it
were
the
coming
together
of
the
two
selfish
unfeeling
natures
had
been
like
the
meeting
of
the
flint
and
steel
setting
loose
the
hidden
fire
and
besides
this
for
bertrand
there
might
have
been
some
excuse
he
had
been
neglected
and
yet
spoilt
he
had
never
known
what
it
was
truly
to
love
any
one
whereas
ruby
had
lived
in
love
all
her
life
and
this
was
her
return
for
it
i
have
killed
my
little
mavis
she
sobbed
yes
it
has
been
all
me
we
need
have
minded
bertrand
he
could
have
made
me
naughty
if
i
had
let
him
oh
mavis
mavis
whatever
shall
i
do
her
glance
fell
again
on
the
flowers
in
her
hand
they
were
not
the
least
withered
or
spoilt
but
as
fresh
as
if
just
newly
gathered
they
seemed
to
smile
up
at
her
and
she
felt
somehow
comforted
dear
little
flowers
she
said
seldom
in
her
life
had
ruby
spoken
so
tenderly
she
started
as
close
beside
her
she
heard
a
faint
sigh
ruby
said
a
voice
can
you
hear
me
yes
said
the
little
girl
beginning
to
tremble
but
you
can
not
see
me
and
yet
i
am
here
close
to
you
as
i
have
often
been
before
try
ruby
try
to
see
me
are
are
you
a
mermaid
or
a
that
other
thing
asked
the
child
there
came
a
little
laugh
scarcely
a
laugh
then
the
sigh
again
if
you
could
see
me
you
would
know
how
foolish
you
are
said
the
voice
but
i
must
have
patience
it
will
come
your
eyes
are
not
strong
ruby
they
are
not
even
as
strong
as
bertrand
yes
they
are
said
ruby
indignantly
i
never
had
sore
eyes
in
my
life
and
bertrand
have
hurt
him
several
times
lately
i
know
so
much
the
better
for
him
was
the
reply
well
for
the
present
ruby
go
on
to
look
for
mavis
you
must
face
it
all
there
the
rain
is
coming
now
ah
and
with
this
which
sounded
like
a
long
sigh
the
voice
seemed
to
waft
itself
away
and
down
came
the
rain
the
same
swirl
which
had
been
too
much
for
sturdy
bertrand
was
upon
ruby
now
standing
too
in
a
far
more
exposed
place
with
no
shelter
near
and
the
rough
rocky
path
before
her
she
did
not
stand
long
she
turned
again
and
began
to
descend
stumbling
slipping
blinded
by
the
rain
dashed
and
knocked
about
by
the
wind
she
might
have
helped
me
whoever
she
was
that
spoke
to
me
sobbed
ruby
it
is
my
fault
if
i
ca
see
creatures
like
that
i
not
good
enough
i
suppose
as
she
said
these
last
words
or
thought
them
rather
a
queer
little
thrill
passed
through
her
and
something
in
spite
of
herself
made
her
look
up
was
it
no
it
could
not
be
she
had
suddenly
thought
a
gleam
of
sunshine
and
blue
sky
had
flashed
on
her
sight
but
no
the
storm
was
too
furious
yet
still
i
did
thought
ruby
i
did
see
something
bright
and
blue
as
if
two
of
my
little
flowers
had
got
up
there
and
were
looking
down
on
me
she
glanced
at
her
hand
the
were
gone
i
must
have
dropped
them
she
said
oh
dear
dear
and
yet
as
she
struggled
on
again
she
did
not
feel
so
miserable
yet
it
was
terribly
hard
work
and
every
moment
her
anxiety
about
mavis
increased
ruby
had
never
so
much
in
all
her
life
who
could
it
be
that
spoke
to
me
so
strangely
she
asked
herself
over
and
over
again
and
what
can
i
do
to
be
able
to
see
her
i
wonder
if
mavis
has
seen
her
i
wonder
and
suddenly
there
came
into
her
mind
the
remembrance
of
miss
hortensia
story
of
the
vision
in
the
west
turret
there
was
something
about
in
it
she
thought
dreamily
could
it
have
been
true
how
she
had
mocked
at
the
story
she
had
at
last
reached
the
shore
by
this
time
the
rain
still
fell
in
pitiless
torrents
but
the
wind
had
fallen
a
little
and
down
here
she
seemed
rather
less
exposed
than
on
the
face
of
the
cliffs
still
ruby
was
completely
drenched
through
never
before
had
she
had
any
conception
of
the
misery
to
which
some
of
our
poor
are
exposed
to
almost
every
day
of
their
lives
and
yet
her
fears
for
mavis
overmastered
all
her
other
sufferings
for
the
first
time
ruby
thought
of
another
more
than
of
herself
mavis
dear
little
mavis
mavis
darling
where
are
you
she
sobbed
wildly
her
teeth
chattering
while
terrible
shivers
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
oh
it
be
that
she
is
under
those
dreadful
fierce
leaping
waves
they
look
as
if
they
were
dancing
in
cruel
joy
over
something
they
had
got
and
a
shudder
worse
than
those
caused
by
the
cold
went
through
the
poor
child
mavis
she
called
out
at
last
after
she
had
peered
round
about
every
large
stone
corner
where
her
sister
could
possibly
have
tried
to
find
shelter
without
coming
upon
the
slightest
trace
of
either
the
child
or
the
boat
you
must
be
in
the
sea
i
go
after
you
it
does
matter
if
i
am
drowned
if
you
are
perhaps
perhaps
the
mermaids
are
keeping
you
safe
there
are
kind
ones
among
them
it
says
in
the
fairy
stories
and
she
turned
resolutely
to
the
water
it
was
cold
icily
cold
as
it
touched
first
her
feet
then
her
ankles
then
crept
up
to
her
knees
it
seemed
to
catch
her
breath
even
before
it
was
at
all
deep
ruby
felt
her
powers
going
and
her
senses
failing
i
shall
never
be
able
to
find
mavis
even
if
she
is
under
the
sea
she
thought
to
herself
just
as
a
huge
wave
caught
her
in
its
rolling
clutch
and
she
knew
no
more
it
seemed
as
if
time
beyond
counting
years
centuries
had
passed
when
ruby
came
to
her
senses
again
enough
to
know
that
she
was
herself
gradually
to
remember
that
once
long
ago
there
had
been
a
little
girl
called
ruby
somewhere
somehow
and
that
some
one
dear
most
dear
to
her
had
been
in
awful
danger
from
which
she
had
tried
to
rescue
her
and
through
all
the
long
mist
through
all
the
dream
wanderings
of
her
spirit
in
which
may
be
it
had
been
learning
lessons
the
fruit
of
which
remained
though
the
teachings
themselves
were
forgotten
for
who
knows
who
can
limit
what
we
learn
in
these
mysterious
ways
ruby
guardian
angel
must
have
rejoiced
to
see
that
the
thought
of
her
sister
not
herself
was
uppermost
mavis
was
the
first
word
she
whispered
mavis
are
you
alive
are
you
not
drowned
darling
but
it
was
such
a
long
time
ago
perhaps
the
world
is
finished
but
mavis
i
thought
mavis
was
dead
and
oh
who
are
you
she
ended
with
a
thrill
which
seemed
to
make
her
quite
alive
and
awake
are
you
the
fairy
in
the
turret
and
what
are
you
doing
to
my
eyes
she
sat
up
and
rubbed
them
there
was
the
strangest
feeling
in
them
not
pain
now
indeed
it
was
though
strange
a
beautiful
feeling
they
felt
drawn
upwards
upwards
to
something
or
some
one
and
a
new
light
and
strength
seemed
to
fill
them
light
and
strength
and
colour
such
as
ruby
had
never
before
even
and
the
some
one
yes
it
was
the
lovely
gracious
figure
with
the
exquisite
once
seen
eyes
of
winfried
princess
ruby
saw
her
at
last
a
smile
overspread
the
sweet
face
the
blue
eyes
shone
with
gladness
how
often
i
have
hoped
for
this
she
murmured
no
ruby
you
will
never
know
how
often
darling
shut
your
eyes
you
must
not
strain
them
shut
your
eyes
and
think
of
mavis
and
trust
yourself
to
me
ruby
obeyed
she
had
not
even
looked
round
to
see
where
she
was
she
only
felt
that
she
was
lying
on
something
soft
and
warm
and
oh
how
nice
it
was
to
feel
dry
again
for
now
the
distant
sensation
began
to
fade
and
she
remembered
everything
clearly
as
if
it
had
happened
say
yesterday
or
the
day
before
at
farthest
the
naughty
mischief
she
and
bertrand
had
been
planning
the
strange
little
boat
the
deserted
cottage
the
hurricane
and
the
misery
about
mavis
the
plunge
in
search
of
her
into
the
sea
even
to
the
loss
of
the
which
had
been
her
only
comfort
all
came
back
and
with
it
a
wonderful
delightful
feeling
of
hope
and
peace
and
trust
such
as
she
had
never
known
before
she
gave
herself
up
to
the
kind
strong
arms
that
clasped
her
round
she
will
take
me
to
mavis
she
thought
and
oh
i
try
never
never
to
be
selfish
and
unkind
and
naughty
again
then
still
wrapped
in
the
soft
warm
mantle
or
rug
she
had
felt
herself
lying
upon
she
was
lifted
upwards
upwards
still
she
knew
not
and
cared
not
whither
for
ruby
eyes
were
closed
and
she
was
fast
asleep
and
this
time
her
sleep
was
dreamless
ruby
my
own
little
ruby
were
the
first
words
she
heard
they
awoke
her
as
nothing
else
would
have
done
mavis
she
whispered
yes
it
was
mavis
she
was
leaning
over
the
couch
on
which
ruby
lay
never
had
ruby
seen
her
so
bright
and
sweet
and
mavis
ruby
repeated
and
you
were
drowned
darling
at
least
and
as
she
raised
herself
a
little
she
looked
round
her
doubtfully
at
least
not
unless
this
is
heaven
it
looks
like
it
only
with
a
deep
sigh
it
ca
be
for
if
it
were
should
be
in
it
no
darling
it
is
heaven
but
it
a
beautiful
place
and
i
it
must
be
a
little
on
the
way
there
it
one
of
the
homes
of
our
princess
she
wo
tell
me
the
name
but
i
call
it
land
is
that
a
good
name
look
all
about
ruby
they
were
in
a
little
arbour
in
one
corner
of
what
one
would
have
called
a
garden
except
that
gardens
are
usually
enclosed
they
stretch
as
far
as
the
eyes
can
see
which
was
the
case
here
a
soft
clear
yet
not
dazzling
or
glaring
light
was
over
everything
yet
there
was
no
sun
visible
in
the
sky
and
as
ruby
gazed
and
gazed
she
began
to
feel
that
there
were
differences
between
this
garden
and
any
others
she
had
ever
seen
one
of
these
mavis
pointed
out
to
her
do
you
see
ruby
she
said
that
all
the
flowers
in
this
garden
are
our
wild
flowers
though
they
are
such
beauties
she
stooped
to
gather
one
or
two
blossoms
growing
close
beside
her
as
she
spoke
see
here
are
the
same
kind
of
that
were
at
the
old
cottage
and
that
we
found
so
strangely
on
the
castle
terrace
and
here
are
violets
and
primroses
and
snowdrops
all
the
spring
flowers
and
the
summer
ones
too
honeysuckle
and
and
even
the
tiny
common
ones
buttercups
and
daisies
and
celandine
and
pimpernel
and
and
and
and
but
you
mixing
them
all
up
together
said
ruby
they
do
all
come
at
the
same
time
of
year
yes
they
do
said
mavis
that
the
wonder
i
found
it
out
for
myself
almost
immediately
and
the
princess
was
so
pleased
i
did
i
think
this
garden
is
a
sort
of
nursery
for
wild
flowers
you
see
up
where
we
live
there
are
no
gardens
or
gardeners
for
them
up
said
ruby
are
we
down
below
the
world
are
we
out
of
the
world
mavis
smiled
i
do
know
she
said
it
may
be
up
or
it
may
be
down
it
matter
the
princess
says
we
may
call
it
fairyland
if
we
like
and
fancy
ruby
old
adam
is
the
gardener
here
a
shadow
passed
over
ruby
face
do
be
frightened
dear
he
knew
you
were
coming
and
he
as
kind
as
kind
we
to
have
supper
at
his
cottage
before
we
go
home
oh
said
ruby
disappointed
then
we
are
to
go
home
oh
yes
mavis
explained
it
would
do
for
us
to
stay
always
here
but
i
we
may
come
back
again
sometimes
adam
has
been
often
here
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
he
told
me
and
now
he
going
to
stay
always
till
it
time
for
him
to
go
somewhere
else
he
says
it
was
too
cold
and
rough
for
him
up
by
the
sea
now
he
is
so
old
and
about
winfried
asked
ruby
growing
very
red
mavis
laughed
joyously
winfried
she
cried
why
he
was
here
already
when
i
came
the
boat
went
down
down
with
me
ruby
when
the
great
waves
rolled
over
it
and
me
i
frightened
just
for
a
minute
and
then
it
was
all
right
and
the
princess
and
winfried
lifted
me
out
how
many
days
ago
was
it
asked
ruby
mavis
shook
her
head
i
do
know
that
either
perhaps
it
not
days
at
all
here
never
thought
about
it
but
cousin
hortensia
wo
be
frightened
the
princess
told
me
that
winfried
will
take
us
home
he
ca
stay
here
either
he
got
work
to
do
somewhere
and
he
can
only
come
back
sometimes
there
ruby
look
there
he
comes
do
you
see
him
coming
up
that
little
hill
he
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
chapter
eleven
down
the
well
the
news
are
spreading
ting
ting
ting
all
the
flowers
have
voices
lovely
the
songs
that
they
sing
the
rejoices
ting
ting
ting
ruby
shrank
back
a
little
i
do
want
to
see
winfried
she
said
after
all
we
did
and
oh
mavis
i
must
be
in
such
a
mess
my
clothes
were
all
soaked
in
the
sea
no
they
were
said
mavis
laughing
at
least
if
they
were
come
right
again
stand
up
ruby
and
shake
yourself
and
look
at
yourself
there
now
did
you
ever
look
neater
or
nicer
in
your
life
ruby
stood
up
and
looked
at
herself
as
mavis
advised
her
is
this
my
own
frock
she
said
no
it
ca
be
see
mavis
all
beautifully
embroidered
with
and
what
lovely
blue
ribbon
my
hair
is
tied
with
and
my
hands
are
so
white
and
clean
mavis
did
the
princess
dress
me
while
i
was
asleep
mavis
nodded
her
head
sagely
something
like
it
she
said
and
oh
continued
ruby
your
frock
is
just
the
same
and
your
ribbons
and
all
nice
you
look
mavis
is
the
princess
here
i
should
so
like
her
to
see
us
she
not
here
said
mavis
she
away
somewhere
i
not
sure
she
added
in
a
lower
voice
but
that
it
about
bertrand
ruby
gave
a
sort
of
shiver
oh
mavis
she
said
he
was
so
cruel
and
so
heartless
and
i
was
so
miserable
i
do
hope
the
princess
will
make
him
go
quite
away
or
if
he
was
to
be
quite
changed
said
mavis
no
no
i
do
want
him
i
only
want
you
my
darling
little
mavis
and
we
shall
be
so
happy
much
much
happier
than
we
have
ever
been
kiss
me
mavis
and
tell
me
you
quite
forgive
me
and
if
ever
i
am
naughty
or
horrid
again
i
hope
the
princess
will
punish
me
she
wo
let
you
forget
her
any
way
said
mavis
i
think
that
is
how
she
punishes
ruby
looked
rather
puzzled
but
before
she
could
ask
more
they
heard
winfried
whistle
and
in
a
moment
he
appeared
his
face
was
all
one
smile
all
ruby
fears
and
misgivings
faded
away
before
it
grandfather
is
waiting
for
you
he
said
there
are
some
cakes
miss
ruby
that
you
will
find
even
better
than
those
others
for
is
better
here
you
see
how
lovely
it
must
all
be
said
ruby
with
a
little
sigh
are
you
sorry
winfried
that
you
ca
stay
here
altogether
mavis
says
you
have
to
go
away
to
work
of
course
said
winfried
cheerily
it
would
never
do
young
as
i
am
not
to
work
and
we
should
enjoy
this
half
as
much
if
we
had
it
always
it
the
rest
and
refreshment
after
common
life
that
makes
half
the
happiness
it
different
for
gran
he
done
part
none
better
and
now
his
work
should
be
light
i
thankful
to
know
he
safe
here
now
we
had
better
go
down
that
little
hill
is
the
way
to
his
cottage
children
you
have
perhaps
never
been
in
fairyland
nor
for
that
matter
have
i
been
there
either
but
i
have
had
glimpses
of
it
a
good
many
times
in
my
life
and
so
i
hope
have
you
and
these
glimpses
do
you
know
become
more
frequent
and
are
less
fleeting
as
one
grows
older
i
at
least
find
it
so
is
not
that
something
to
look
forward
to
though
after
all
this
sweet
country
to
which
our
three
little
friends
thanks
to
the
beautiful
princess
had
found
their
way
was
scarcely
the
dream
region
which
we
think
of
as
fairyland
it
was
better
described
by
little
mavis
own
name
for
the
nameless
garden
land
for
once
having
entered
there
no
one
can
lose
the
remembrance
of
it
any
more
than
once
having
looked
into
eyes
one
can
forget
princess
herself
but
it
would
be
difficult
to
describe
this
magic
land
i
must
leave
a
good
deal
of
it
to
that
kind
of
fancy
which
comes
nearer
truth
than
clumsy
words
though
as
it
is
nice
to
be
told
all
that
be
told
of
the
sweetest
and
most
beautiful
things
i
will
try
to
tell
you
a
little
of
what
ruby
and
mavis
saw
it
might
not
have
seemed
such
a
lovely
place
to
everybody
perhaps
time
had
been
even
when
ruby
herself
might
not
have
thought
it
so
for
this
was
not
a
gorgeous
place
it
was
just
sweet
and
restful
as
i
told
you
all
the
flowers
were
wild
flowers
but
that
gives
you
no
idea
of
what
they
looked
like
for
they
were
carefully
tended
and
arranged
growing
in
great
masses
together
in
a
way
we
never
see
except
sometimes
in
spring
when
the
primroses
almost
hide
the
ground
where
they
grow
or
at
midsummer
when
a
rich
luxuriance
of
and
honeysuckle
makes
it
seem
as
if
they
had
been
planted
on
purpose
as
children
say
all
along
the
grassy
paths
where
winfried
led
them
every
step
made
the
little
girls
exclaim
in
new
admiration
oh
see
ruby
there
is
a
whole
bank
of
i
could
not
have
believed
it
would
look
so
beautiful
and
there
look
at
those
masses
of
cicely
just
like
snowflakes
and
in
fields
it
is
such
a
poor
frightened
little
weed
of
a
flower
you
scarcely
notice
it
said
mavis
but
it
lovely
if
you
look
into
it
closely
said
winfried
some
of
the
very
tiniest
flowers
are
really
the
most
beautiful
then
they
came
in
sight
of
a
stretch
of
white
and
blue
the
kind
that
in
some
places
are
called
stop
a
moment
said
the
boy
stop
and
listen
hush
there
now
do
you
hear
them
ringing
that
is
a
sound
you
can
never
hear
in
anywhere
but
here
they
listened
with
all
their
ears
you
may
be
sure
yes
as
they
grew
accustomed
to
the
exceeding
stillness
to
the
clear
thin
of
the
air
they
heard
the
softest
sweetest
tinkle
you
can
imagine
a
perfect
fairy
and
the
longer
they
listened
the
clearer
it
grew
oh
how
wonderful
said
mavis
and
ruby
added
i
should
think
if
we
lived
long
enough
in
this
country
we
should
end
by
hearing
the
grass
growing
perhaps
said
winfried
but
do
you
miss
the
sea
things
ruby
went
on
you
love
them
so
winfried
and
somehow
you
seem
to
belong
to
the
sea
so
i
do
the
boy
replied
the
sea
is
my
life
coming
here
is
only
a
rest
and
a
holiday
i
wonder
said
mavis
i
wonder
if
there
is
a
garden
country
for
the
sea
to
match
this
for
the
land
a
place
where
seaweeds
and
corals
and
all
the
loveliest
sea
things
are
taken
care
of
like
the
wild
flowers
here
you
may
be
sure
there
is
said
the
smiling
there
is
no
saying
what
the
princess
wo
have
to
show
us
and
where
she
wo
take
us
now
she
has
us
in
hand
why
only
to
look
into
her
eyes
you
can
see
it
they
seem
to
reach
to
everywhere
everywhere
and
everything
beautiful
seems
in
them
you
have
seen
farther
into
them
than
we
have
said
mavis
thoughtfully
but
still
i
think
i
can
understand
what
you
mean
so
can
i
a
little
said
ruby
but
they
are
rather
frightening
too
do
you
think
they
must
be
at
first
said
winfried
but
just
then
a
little
way
off
they
caught
sight
of
old
adam
coming
to
meet
them
his
cottage
was
close
by
they
came
upon
it
suddenly
for
it
stood
under
the
shelter
of
the
hill
they
had
been
descending
such
a
lovely
cottage
it
was
so
simple
yet
so
pretty
clean
with
a
cleanness
you
never
see
out
of
fairyland
or
places
of
that
kind
with
flowers
of
all
kinds
above
all
clustering
about
it
and
peeping
in
at
the
windows
adam
welcomed
his
little
guests
as
kindly
as
if
no
unkind
thought
of
him
had
ever
entered
ruby
head
he
made
no
difference
between
her
and
mavis
and
i
think
this
caused
ruby
to
feel
more
sorry
than
anything
could
have
done
if
they
had
been
happy
that
afternoon
in
the
cottage
by
the
sea
you
can
fancy
how
happy
they
were
in
this
wonderful
new
fairy
home
of
the
good
old
man
there
was
no
end
to
the
things
he
had
to
show
them
and
teach
them
mostly
i
think
about
flowers
things
they
had
never
dreamt
of
beauties
of
form
and
colour
such
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
describe
and
each
time
they
came
to
see
him
he
promised
to
show
and
teach
them
still
more
but
at
last
winfried
said
they
must
be
going
i
promised
the
princess
he
said
for
now
he
spoke
of
her
quite
openly
to
the
children
that
i
would
take
you
home
by
the
time
the
sun
sets
beside
the
castle
and
it
must
be
near
that
now
and
how
are
we
to
go
home
asked
ruby
the
boat
is
ready
winfried
answered
but
where
the
sea
for
it
to
sail
on
whispered
ruby
to
mavis
she
had
not
the
courage
to
ask
winfried
anymore
wait
and
see
said
mavis
i
do
know
but
it
is
sure
to
be
all
right
then
they
bade
adam
farewell
promising
to
come
to
visit
him
again
whenever
they
should
be
allowed
to
do
so
and
rather
wondering
where
winfried
was
going
to
take
them
they
set
off
there
was
some
reason
for
ruby
question
for
so
far
they
had
seen
no
water
at
all
in
land
everything
seemed
fresh
and
fragrant
as
if
there
was
no
dearth
of
moisture
but
there
was
neither
lake
nor
pond
nor
running
brook
winfried
mounted
the
hill
a
little
way
then
turning
sharply
they
found
themselves
in
a
sort
of
small
wooded
ravine
or
glen
steps
led
down
the
steep
sides
to
the
bottom
which
was
a
perfect
thicket
of
ferns
mostly
of
the
deep
green
delicate
kind
which
loves
darkness
and
water
winfried
stooped
and
lifted
by
a
ring
fixed
into
it
a
heavy
stone
you
wo
be
frightened
he
said
this
is
the
way
we
have
to
go
down
the
well
i
go
first
you
find
it
quite
easy
it
scarcely
looked
so
for
it
was
very
dark
winfried
stepped
in
there
was
a
ladder
against
the
side
and
soon
disappeared
all
but
his
head
then
mavis
and
lastly
trembling
a
little
it
must
be
confessed
ruby
as
soon
as
they
were
all
inside
the
stone
lid
shut
itself
down
but
instead
as
one
might
have
expected
of
this
leaving
them
in
darkness
a
clear
almost
bright
light
shone
upwards
as
if
a
large
lamp
had
been
lighted
at
the
foot
of
the
well
and
without
difficulty
the
children
made
their
way
down
the
ladder
that
very
nice
said
ruby
i
was
so
afraid
we
were
going
to
be
in
the
dark
were
you
dear
said
a
voice
whose
sweet
tones
were
not
strange
to
her
no
fear
of
that
when
i
have
to
do
with
things
jump
right
here
you
are
and
you
too
mavis
the
princess
was
standing
in
the
boat
for
the
well
widened
out
at
one
side
into
a
little
stream
large
enough
to
row
along
the
brook
takes
us
to
the
river
and
the
river
to
the
sea
that
is
your
way
home
she
said
winfried
will
row
and
you
two
shall
nestle
up
to
me
she
put
an
arm
round
each
and
in
silence
save
for
the
gentle
drip
of
the
oars
the
little
boat
made
its
way
it
was
a
still
evening
not
yet
dark
though
growing
dusk
and
though
they
were
back
in
the
winter
world
by
now
the
children
felt
no
cold
who
could
have
felt
cold
with
the
princess
mantle
round
them
they
grew
sleepy
too
sleepy
to
notice
how
as
she
had
said
the
brook
turned
into
the
river
and
the
river
led
on
to
the
sea
the
familiar
sea
not
more
than
a
mile
or
two
from
the
cove
below
the
castle
and
it
was
only
when
the
boat
grated
a
little
on
the
pebbly
shore
that
both
ruby
and
mavis
started
up
to
find
themselves
alone
with
winfried
the
princess
had
left
them
i
will
go
up
to
the
door
with
you
said
the
boy
miss
hortensia
is
expecting
you
see
there
she
is
standing
under
the
archway
with
a
lantern
my
darlings
said
their
cousin
so
winfried
has
brought
you
safe
home
and
i
must
hurry
back
said
the
and
almost
before
they
could
thank
him
or
say
he
had
disappeared
again
in
the
gloom
it
seemed
to
the
children
as
miss
hortensia
kissed
them
that
had
passed
since
they
had
seen
her
or
their
home
have
you
been
dreadfully
lonely
without
us
all
this
time
dear
cousin
said
mavis
no
dears
not
particularly
so
it
is
a
little
later
than
usual
but
when
winfried
ran
back
to
tell
me
he
would
bring
you
safe
home
he
said
it
might
be
so
was
it
only
afternoon
we
went
said
ruby
wonderingly
miss
hortensia
looked
at
her
anxiously
my
dear
are
you
very
tired
you
seem
half
asleep
i
am
rather
sleepy
said
ruby
please
may
we
go
to
bed
at
once
certainly
i
will
tell
ulrica
to
take
your
supper
upstairs
i
do
hope
you
have
caught
cold
we
must
shut
the
door
for
they
were
standing
all
this
time
at
the
entrance
under
the
archway
bertrand
is
behind
you
i
suppose
the
little
girls
looked
at
each
other
we
have
not
seen
him
for
ever
so
long
they
replied
he
would
not
stay
with
me
said
ruby
i
thought
perhaps
we
should
find
him
here
said
mavis
miss
hortensia
looked
more
annoyed
than
anxious
i
suppose
he
will
find
his
way
back
before
long
she
said
bad
pennies
always
turn
up
but
he
is
a
most
troublesome
boy
i
wish
i
had
asked
winfried
what
to
do
i
do
think
he
could
have
done
anything
said
mavis
but
i
sure
bertrand
is
safe
what
the
matter
ulrica
for
at
that
moment
they
were
on
their
way
upstairs
by
this
time
the
young
came
flying
to
meet
them
her
face
pale
her
eyes
gleaming
with
fear
oh
she
cried
i
am
glad
the
young
ladies
are
safe
back
martin
has
seen
the
blue
light
in
the
west
turret
he
was
coming
from
the
village
a
few
minutes
ago
and
something
made
him
look
up
it
is
many
and
many
a
year
since
it
has
been
seen
not
since
the
young
ladies
were
babies
and
it
always
stop
ulrica
said
miss
hortensia
sharply
it
is
very
wrong
of
you
to
come
startling
us
in
that
wild
way
and
the
young
ladies
so
tired
as
you
see
call
bertha
and
joseph
you
take
the
children
to
their
room
and
see
that
they
are
warm
and
comfortable
i
will
myself
go
up
to
the
west
turret
with
the
others
and
put
a
stop
to
these
idle
tales
but
ruby
and
mavis
pressed
forward
a
strange
thought
had
struck
them
both
oh
cousin
let
us
go
too
they
said
we
are
not
a
bit
frightened
so
when
old
joseph
and
bertha
had
joined
them
the
whole
party
set
off
for
the
turret
as
they
got
near
to
the
top
of
the
stair
a
slight
sound
made
them
all
start
hush
said
miss
hortensia
they
stood
in
perfect
silence
it
came
again
a
murmur
of
faint
sobs
and
weeping
ulrica
grew
whiter
and
whiter
i
told
you
so
she
began
but
no
one
listened
they
all
pressed
on
miss
hortensia
the
first
when
she
opened
the
door
it
was
except
for
the
lamp
she
held
in
her
hand
upon
total
darkness
but
in
one
corner
was
heard
a
sort
of
convulsive
breathing
and
then
a
voice
who
there
who
there
oh
the
pain
the
cruel
pain
and
there
lying
on
the
same
little
on
which
years
and
years
ago
miss
hortensia
had
slept
and
dreamt
of
the
lovely
fairy
lady
was
bertrand
weeping
and
moaning
utterly
broken
down
but
he
turned
away
sullenly
from
miss
hortensia
when
she
leant
over
him
in
concern
and
pity
he
would
not
look
at
ruby
either
and
it
was
not
till
after
some
moments
had
passed
that
they
at
last
heard
him
whisper
mavis
i
want
to
speak
to
mavis
go
away
everybody
i
only
want
mavis
they
all
looked
at
each
other
in
mute
astonishment
they
thought
he
was
wandering
in
his
mind
but
no
he
kept
to
the
same
idea
mavis
he
repeated
come
here
and
give
me
your
hand
i
ca
see
you
oh
the
pain
the
pain
then
mavis
came
forward
and
the
others
drew
back
in
a
group
to
the
door
try
and
find
out
what
it
is
surely
it
is
not
another
naughty
trick
that
he
is
playing
said
miss
hortensia
anxiously
no
no
i
am
sure
it
is
do
be
afraid
dear
cousin
said
the
little
girl
chapter
twelve
opened
eyes
the
world
that
only
thy
spirit
knows
is
the
fairest
world
of
the
three
mavis
whispered
bertrand
when
he
was
sure
the
others
were
out
of
earshot
you
can
understand
they
would
think
i
was
mad
listen
stoop
down
it
is
you
know
who
i
mean
she
made
me
see
her
and
oh
the
pain
is
too
awful
it
is
only
in
my
eyes
it
goes
down
into
my
heart
somehow
what
shall
i
do
ca
you
make
her
come
to
take
it
away
i
been
crying
and
crying
to
her
but
she
wo
perhaps
it
is
that
you
bear
it
said
mavis
think
that
way
and
see
if
that
makes
it
any
better
the
boy
gasped
but
did
not
speak
after
a
moment
or
two
he
went
on
again
i
was
in
the
caves
behind
the
cottage
i
ran
in
to
get
out
of
the
storm
and
because
i
did
want
to
go
looking
for
you
i
thought
you
were
drowned
and
i
did
want
to
see
your
white
face
he
shivered
and
i
was
peeping
about
in
one
of
the
caves
when
i
fell
i
do
know
how
or
where
i
fell
down
down
ever
so
far
i
thought
i
was
never
going
to
stop
and
then
my
breath
went
away
and
i
did
know
anything
till
i
found
myself
in
another
cave
all
knocked
about
and
bruised
aching
now
all
over
but
i
do
mind
that
and
then
mavis
came
and
looked
at
me
you
saw
her
said
mavis
yes
oh
mavis
she
made
my
eyes
go
up
to
hers
and
oh
the
pain
she
did
say
anything
except
just
but
i
knew
all
she
meant
better
than
by
any
speaking
and
she
was
kind
she
lifted
me
and
carried
me
up
here
and
she
put
something
on
my
leg
that
was
where
i
was
most
hurt
i
think
then
she
sat
by
me
here
and
she
put
it
all
into
my
mind
all
the
naughty
things
i
ever
done
mavis
i
know
i
did
how
bad
i
was
it
came
out
of
her
eyes
somehow
though
i
dared
not
look
again
and
when
she
went
away
even
though
i
she
kissed
me
the
pain
got
worse
and
worse
oh
mavis
will
it
ever
go
will
my
eyes
ever
feel
the
same
again
no
said
mavis
i
do
think
they
ever
feel
the
for
they
feel
much
much
better
than
they
used
to
the
pain
will
go
though
it
may
come
back
sometimes
to
you
i
sha
need
reminding
said
the
boy
i
ca
ever
forget
sure
of
that
i
wish
i
could
no
bertrand
i
do
think
you
do
wish
that
he
gave
an
impatient
wriggle
but
without
speaking
oh
the
pain
he
cried
again
in
a
moment
or
two
and
it
did
seem
a
little
better
miss
hortensia
came
forward
mavis
my
dear
what
is
it
where
is
he
hurt
and
why
did
you
hide
yourself
up
here
bertrand
instead
of
coming
to
me
bertrand
would
not
answer
he
turned
his
face
away
again
he
had
a
fall
cousin
hortensia
said
mavis
but
i
do
think
it
very
bad
he
says
he
only
bruised
and
sore
bertrand
do
you
think
you
can
manage
to
get
down
to
your
own
room
if
you
come
at
one
side
and
joseph
at
the
other
i
try
said
the
boy
with
unusual
graciousness
and
when
i
in
bed
will
you
stay
beside
me
mavis
i
think
the
pain
is
so
bad
when
you
there
he
whispered
so
that
no
one
else
could
hear
miss
hortensia
was
i
will
order
a
fire
to
be
lighted
in
bertrand
room
she
said
and
if
you
like
mavis
you
may
have
your
supper
there
beside
him
she
hurried
away
calling
ruby
to
go
with
her
it
was
a
sign
of
a
very
different
state
of
things
with
ruby
that
she
showed
and
felt
no
jealousy
at
bertrand
preference
for
her
sister
poor
bertrand
she
said
to
herself
softly
perhaps
i
made
him
naughtier
than
he
would
have
been
the
boy
was
more
hurt
than
he
would
allow
but
he
put
great
constraint
on
himself
and
limped
downstairs
with
scarcely
a
groan
it
nothing
compared
to
the
other
pain
he
murmured
and
when
he
was
at
last
safely
deposited
in
his
little
bed
he
looked
so
white
and
pitiful
that
for
the
first
time
mavis
stooped
down
and
gave
him
a
loving
kiss
bertrand
started
what
is
it
said
mavis
i
do
know
he
replied
when
you
kissed
me
the
pain
got
worse
for
a
moment
it
gave
a
great
stab
but
now
it
seems
better
if
you
kiss
me
again
mavis
the
last
thing
when
you
say
perhaps
i
be
able
to
go
to
sleep
she
stayed
beside
him
all
the
rest
of
the
evening
he
scarcely
spoke
only
groaning
a
little
from
time
to
time
when
miss
hortensia
came
in
to
send
mavis
to
bed
she
began
for
the
first
time
to
feel
really
uneasy
about
the
boy
mavis
she
said
not
meaning
bertrand
to
hear
if
he
is
better
morning
we
must
send
for
the
doctor
perhaps
said
the
little
girl
he
could
do
something
to
take
away
the
aching
poor
bertrand
is
aching
all
over
from
his
fall
i
do
mind
that
said
the
boy
suddenly
it
is
that
you
know
it
is
mavis
and
i
wo
have
the
doctor
ruby
who
had
stolen
in
behind
her
cousin
crept
up
to
mavis
do
you
think
she
whispered
do
you
think
mavis
that
he
has
seen
and
that
that
it
mavis
did
not
answer
bertrand
she
said
we
are
going
to
bed
now
do
you
mind
being
left
alone
for
the
night
no
he
said
i
rather
unless
it
was
you
and
you
ca
stay
you
be
too
tired
listen
and
he
drew
her
down
to
him
do
you
think
perhaps
she
come
again
and
take
away
the
pain
for
i
sorry
now
i
am
sorry
and
i
did
know
how
bad
i
was
poor
bertrand
whispered
mavis
pityingly
perhaps
she
will
come
any
way
if
you
are
patient
and
try
to
think
the
pain
has
to
be
i
think
it
will
get
better
even
if
it
does
go
away
altogether
and
again
she
kissed
him
mavis
said
ruby
as
the
two
little
sisters
were
lying
side
by
side
in
their
white
curtained
beds
cousin
hortensia
may
not
know
it
and
nobody
may
know
it
but
know
it
and
it
is
that
years
have
passed
since
we
went
to
bed
here
last
night
yes
said
mavis
i
think
so
too
there
are
some
things
that
you
ca
count
time
for
which
are
really
far
more
than
any
time
all
my
hating
of
bertrand
has
gone
away
now
continued
ruby
only
i
do
want
him
to
stay
here
because
the
naughty
in
him
and
the
naughty
in
me
might
get
together
again
like
it
did
before
why
do
you
think
of
the
good
in
him
and
the
good
in
you
joining
to
make
you
both
better
and
the
good
in
me
too
i
suppose
it
conceited
to
think
there
is
a
little
good
in
oneself
at
least
trying
to
be
and
wanting
to
be
said
mavis
with
a
little
sigh
but
you
so
much
quicker
and
cleverer
than
i
am
ruby
i
wish
you
would
think
about
helping
me
and
not
about
being
naughty
and
oh
ruby
it
lovely
to
think
that
we
may
go
sometimes
to
land
let
go
to
sleep
now
as
quick
as
we
can
and
dream
of
it
said
ruby
bertrand
looked
still
very
white
and
ill
the
next
day
he
was
very
quiet
and
subdued
and
even
gave
in
to
miss
hortensia
decision
that
the
doctor
must
be
sent
for
the
doctor
came
and
shook
his
head
the
boy
was
not
in
a
satisfactory
condition
which
they
knew
already
as
it
happened
otherwise
the
doctor
would
not
have
been
sent
for
he
had
been
shaken
by
the
fall
and
it
was
possible
that
his
back
had
been
injured
there
was
not
much
comfort
in
all
this
certainly
but
it
decided
one
thing
that
he
was
to
stay
where
he
was
for
the
present
not
to
attempt
to
get
up
or
to
move
about
and
strange
to
say
this
too
bertrand
accepted
uncomplainingly
he
said
no
word
to
the
doctor
of
the
strange
pain
he
had
confided
about
to
mavis
and
though
his
eyes
seemed
sad
and
wearied
they
had
a
new
look
in
them
which
had
never
been
there
before
even
miss
hortensia
was
moved
by
it
though
hitherto
and
rightly
she
had
been
inclined
to
treat
bertrand
troubles
as
well
deserved
is
there
anything
we
can
do
for
you
my
poor
boy
she
said
kindly
no
thank
you
he
replied
except
to
let
mavis
come
to
stay
beside
me
sometimes
and
he
hesitated
if
the
winfried
comes
to
the
castle
i
like
to
see
him
certainly
miss
hortensia
answered
but
i
doubt
if
he
will
come
any
more
i
hear
in
the
village
that
his
grandfather
has
gone
away
quite
away
to
a
milder
part
of
the
country
i
ca
understand
it
it
seems
so
sudden
but
winfried
did
come
that
very
afternoon
his
new
home
was
not
so
very
far
away
he
told
miss
hortensia
with
a
smile
gran
home
that
is
to
say
he
went
on
but
i
myself
am
going
to
have
a
different
kind
of
home
now
i
going
to
sea
i
always
wished
it
and
gran
has
wished
it
for
me
but
wo
he
miss
you
terribly
asked
the
lady
i
often
be
with
him
and
he
well
cared
for
where
he
is
said
the
boy
and
then
mavis
took
him
up
to
see
bertrand
with
whom
she
left
him
alone
for
some
time
there
was
a
brighter
look
in
the
boy
face
when
she
went
back
to
him
winfried
has
promised
to
come
again
before
he
goes
quite
away
he
said
did
you
know
mavis
that
he
is
going
ever
so
far
away
he
is
going
to
be
a
sailor
a
real
sailor
not
a
fisherman
he
says
he
has
always
wanted
it
but
he
could
leave
his
grandfather
alone
here
where
the
village
people
were
not
bertrand
stopped
suddenly
as
it
struck
him
that
it
was
not
the
ignorant
village
people
only
who
had
been
unkind
to
good
old
adam
mavis
understood
but
said
nothing
and
after
a
bit
bertrand
went
out
again
mavis
he
said
i
seen
her
again
either
i
saw
her
or
i
dreamt
of
her
i
do
much
mind
which
it
was
for
it
all
come
true
she
said
i
must
try
to
bear
it
like
what
you
said
mavis
and
it
has
got
better
but
she
said
it
would
come
back
again
and
that
i
get
to
want
it
to
come
back
at
least
unless
i
wanted
to
forget
her
and
i
do
want
to
do
that
i
do
think
i
even
if
i
tried
and
she
kissed
me
my
eyes
mavis
so
you
see
i
could
forget
her
now
you
never
could
i
sure
said
mavis
that
what
she
is
it
her
name
bertrand
threw
himself
back
with
a
sigh
i
ca
feel
like
you
he
said
i
never
thought
about
being
good
and
sometimes
i
think
i
wo
try
oh
mavis
was
it
the
pain
again
said
the
little
girl
sympathisingly
though
in
her
heart
she
felt
inclined
to
smile
a
very
little
yes
said
bertrand
dolefully
i
afraid
it
will
take
an
awfully
long
time
before
i
begin
to
get
the
least
bit
good
and
he
sighed
again
still
more
deeply
just
then
ruby
put
her
head
in
at
the
door
she
and
bertrand
were
not
yet
quite
at
ease
with
each
other
but
she
came
up
to
his
bedside
very
gently
and
said
she
hoped
he
was
better
to
which
he
replied
meekly
enough
though
rather
stiffly
mavis
said
ruby
eagerly
pleased
to
find
something
to
talk
about
have
you
heard
about
winfried
about
his
going
to
be
a
real
sailor
yes
said
mavis
bertrand
was
talking
about
it
bertrand
sat
up
and
his
eyes
sparkled
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
he
said
but
i
think
i
must
do
you
know
i
believe
i
shall
be
a
sailor
too
papa
has
always
wanted
it
since
i
was
quite
little
and
i
shall
soon
be
old
enough
to
begin
but
i
thought
i
would
like
it
till
i
came
here
and
saw
the
sea
and
now
winfried
talking
has
made
it
come
into
my
mind
just
the
way
papa
said
it
did
into
his
when
he
was
a
boy
ruby
glanced
at
him
admiringly
how
brave
you
are
bertrand
she
said
which
was
a
very
foolish
speech
no
he
said
with
a
touch
of
his
old
roughness
i
not
it
that
at
all
mavis
would
you
be
glad
for
me
to
be
a
sailor
if
you
found
it
the
best
thing
for
you
i
be
glad
said
mavis
sailors
must
see
wonderful
and
beautiful
things
she
went
on
thoughtfully
perhaps
you
and
winfried
might
be
sailors
together
some
time
said
ruby
that
would
be
nice
yes
said
bertrand
when
i
got
to
be
captain
or
something
like
that
i
look
him
up
and
but
he
stopped
abruptly
there
had
been
a
touch
of
arrogance
in
his
tone
just
then
ruby
ran
off
mavis
was
going
too
but
bertrand
stopped
her
mavis
he
said
winfried
knows
all
about
he
calls
her
his
princess
i
know
said
mavis
and
bertrand
went
on
he
says
he
knows
she
never
be
far
away
if
he
wants
her
even
so
far
away
over
at
the
other
side
of
the
world
out
at
sea
with
no
land
for
weeks
and
months
he
says
it
would
be
just
the
same
or
even
better
the
loneliness
makes
it
easier
to
see
her
sometimes
he
says
i
can
fancy
that
he
went
on
dreamily
her
eyes
are
a
little
like
the
sea
do
you
think
mavis
like
the
sea
when
it
is
good
quite
at
peace
loving
and
gentle
she
replied
but
still
if
you
had
lived
beside
the
sea
as
long
as
we
have
bertrand
you
understand
that
there
never
a
sure
feeling
about
it
you
never
know
what
it
wo
be
doing
next
and
the
princess
you
know
makes
you
feel
surer
than
sure
that
the
best
of
her
yes
said
bertrand
the
sea
like
ruby
and
me
now
just
at
this
time
i
want
more
than
anything
to
be
good
and
never
to
be
selfish
or
cruel
or
or
boasting
or
mischievous
but
when
i
get
about
again
with
ruby
even
though
she
very
good
now
and
she
never
was
anything
like
as
bad
as
me
i
do
feel
sure
but
what
we
might
do
each
other
harm
and
forget
about
being
good
and
all
that
do
you
see
i
think
it
a
very
good
thing
that
you
do
feel
sure
said
mavis
but
she
was
struck
by
his
saying
just
what
ruby
herself
had
said
and
it
made
her
a
little
anxious
the
children
new
resolutions
however
were
not
put
to
the
test
in
the
way
they
expected
bertrand
quickly
got
well
again
and
was
able
to
run
about
in
his
usual
way
but
very
soon
after
this
his
uncle
the
father
of
ruby
and
mavis
came
unexpectedly
for
one
of
his
short
visits
to
the
castle
to
his
little
daughters
great
delight
and
when
he
left
he
took
bertrand
away
with
him
there
was
more
than
one
reason
for
the
boy
visit
coming
to
an
end
so
much
sooner
than
had
been
intended
miss
hortensia
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
it
for
though
she
had
grown
to
like
bertrand
much
better
during
his
illness
and
no
one
could
have
been
more
delighted
than
she
at
the
improvement
in
him
it
was
not
to
be
wondered
at
if
she
trembled
at
continuing
to
have
the
charge
of
him
then
too
bertrand
confided
to
his
uncle
his
wish
to
be
a
sailor
in
which
he
never
again
wavered
ruby
and
mavis
felt
sad
when
the
travellers
had
left
them
their
father
were
the
only
alloy
to
the
pleasure
of
his
visits
and
this
time
there
was
bertrand
to
say
to
also
who
would
have
thought
said
mavis
that
we
should
ever
be
sorry
to
see
him
go
but
i
am
glad
to
feel
sorry
yes
said
miss
hortensia
much
better
for
him
to
go
while
his
present
mood
lasts
and
we
are
able
to
regret
him
and
may
be
he
will
come
to
pay
us
a
visit
again
some
time
or
other
i
hope
he
will
said
mavis
i
do
think
he
will
again
be
like
what
he
was
cousin
mavis
said
ruby
when
they
were
alone
when
bertrand
does
come
to
see
us
again
we
must
plan
all
to
go
to
land
together
it
would
be
so
nice
all
four
of
us
winfried
will
come
to
see
us
again
soon
he
said
he
would
whenever
he
comes
to
his
grandfather
let
us
ask
him
i
am
sure
the
princess
would
mind
now
bertrand
is
so
different
i
am
sure
she
would
said
mavis
smiling
and
who
knows
ruby
went
on
what
lovely
new
things
and
places
we
sha
see
when
we
go
there
again
winfried
says
there
no
end
to
them
and
that
every
time
we
go
we
find
more
to
see
perhaps
it
because
we
learn
to
see
better
and
better
said
mavis
and
i
think
she
was
right
the
end
