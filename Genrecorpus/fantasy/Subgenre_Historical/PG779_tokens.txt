your

valdes
sweet
valdes
and
cornelius
know
that
your
words
have
won
me
at
the
last
to
practice
magic
and
concealed
arts
yet
not
your
words
only
but
mine
own
fantasy
that
will
receive
no
object
for
my
head
but
ruminates
on
necromantic
skill
philosophy
is
odious
and
obscure
both
law
and
physic
are
for
petty
wits
divinity
is
basest
of
the
three
unpleasant
harsh
contemptible
and
vile
is
magic
magic
that
hath
ravish
me
then
gentle
friends
aid
me
in
this
attempt
and
i
that
have
with
concise
syllogisms
gravell
the
pastors
of
the
german
church
and
made
the
flowering
pride
of
wertenberg
swarm
to
my
problems
as
the
infernal
spirits
on
sweet
musaeus
when
he
came
to
hell
will
be
as
cunning
as
agrippa
was
whose
shadow
made
all
europe
honour
him
valdes
faustus
these
books
thy
wit
and
our
experience
shall
make
all
nations
to
canonize
us
as
indian
moors
obey
their
spanish
lords
so
shall
the
spirits
of
every
element
be
always
serviceable
to
us
three
like
lions
shall
they
guard
us
when
we
please
like
almain
rutters
with
their
horsemen
staves
or
lapland
giants
trotting
by
our
sides
sometimes
like
women
or
unwedded
maids
shadowing
more
beauty
in
their
airy
brows
than
have
the
white
breasts
of
the
queen
of
love
from
venice
shall
they
drag
huge
argosies
and
from
america
the
golden
fleece
that
yearly
stuffs
old
philip
treasury
if
learned
faustus
will
be
resolute
faustus
valdes
as
resolute
am
i
in
this
as
thou
to
live
therefore
object
it
not
cornelius
the
miracles
that
magic
will
perform
will
make
thee
vow
to
study
nothing
else
he
that
is
grounded
in
astrology
enrich
with
tongues
well
seen
in
minerals
hath
all
the
principles
magic
doth
require
then
doubt
not
faustus
but
to
be
renowm
and
more
frequented
for
this
mystery
than
heretofore
the
delphian
oracle
the
spirits
tell
me
they
can
dry
the
sea
and
fetch
the
treasure
of
all
foreign
wrecks
ay
all
the
wealth
that
our
forefathers
hid
within
the
massy
entrails
of
the
earth
then
tell
me
faustus
what
shall
we
three
want
faustus
nothing
cornelius
o
this
cheers
my
soul
come
shew
me
some
demonstrations
magical
that
i
may
conjure
in
some
lusty
grove
and
have
these
joys
in
full
possession
valdes
then
haste
thee
to
some
solitary
grove
and
bear
wise
bacon
and
albertus
works
the
hebrew
psalter
and
new
testament
and
whatsoever
else
is
requisite
we
will
inform
thee
ere
our
conference
cease
cornelius
valdes
first
let
him
know
the
words
of
art
and
then
all
other
ceremonies
learn
faustus
may
try
his
cunning
by
himself
valdes
first
i
instruct
thee
in
the
rudiments
and
then
wilt
thou
be
perfecter
than
faustus
then
come
and
dine
with
me
and
after
meat
we
canvass
every
quiddity
thereof
for
ere
i
sleep
i
try
what
i
can
do
this
night
i
conjure
though
i
die
therefore
exeunt
enter
two
scholars
first
scholar
i
wonder
what
become
of
faustus
that
was
wont
to
make
our
schools
ring
with
sic
probo
second
scholar
that
shall
we
know
for
see
here
comes
his
boy
enter
wagner
first
scholar
how
now
sirrah
where
thy
master
wagner
god
in
heaven
knows
second
scholar
why
dost
not
thou
know
wagner
yes
i
know
but
that
follows
not
first
scholar
go
to
sirrah
leave
your
jesting
and
tell
us
where
he
is
wagner
that
follows
not
necessary
by
force
of
argument
that
you
being
licentiates
should
stand
upon
therefore
acknowledge
your
error
and
be
attentive
second
scholar
why
didst
thou
not
say
thou
knewest
wagner
have
you
any
witness
o
first
scholar
yes
sirrah
i
heard
you
wagner
ask
my
fellow
if
i
be
a
thief
second
scholar
well
you
will
not
tell
us
wagner
yes
sir
i
will
tell
you
yet
if
you
were
not
dunces
you
would
never
ask
me
such
a
question
for
is
not
he
corpus
naturale
and
is
not
that
mobile
then
wherefore
should
you
ask
me
such
a
question
but
that
i
am
by
nature
phlegmatic
slow
to
wrath
and
prone
to
lechery
to
love
i
would
say
it
were
not
for
you
to
come
within
forty
foot
of
the
place
of
execution
although
i
do
not
doubt
to
see
you
both
hanged
the
next
sessions
thus
having
triumphed
over
you
i
will
set
my
countenance
like
a
precisian
and
begin
to
speak
thus
truly
my
dear
brethren
my
master
is
within
at
dinner
with
valdes
and
cornelius
as
this
wine
if
it
could
speak
would
inform
your
worships
and
so
the
lord
bless
you
preserve
you
and
keep
you
my
dear
brethren
my
dear
brethren
exit
first
scholar
nay
then
i
fear
he
is
fallen
into
that
damned
art
for
which
they
two
are
infamous
through
the
world
second
scholar
were
he
a
stranger
and
not
allied
to
me
yet
should
i
grieve
for
him
but
come
let
us
go
and
inform
the
rector
and
see
if
he
by
his
grave
counsel
can
reclaim
him
first
scholar
o
but
i
fear
me
nothing
can
reclaim
him
second
scholar
yet
let
us
try
what
we
can
do
exeunt
enter
faustus
to
conjure
faustus
now
that
the
gloomy
shadow
of
the
earth
longing
to
view
orion
drizzling
look
leaps
from
th
antartic
world
unto
the
sky
and
dims
the
welkin
with
her
pitchy
breath
faustus
begin
thine
incantations
and
try
if
devils
will
obey
thy
hest

thou
hast

then
fear
not

thou

me
go

becomes

best
exit
mephistophilis
i
see
there
virtue
in
my
heavenly
words
who
would
not
be
proficient
in
this
art
how
pliant
is
this
mephistophilis
full
of
obedience
and
humility
such
is
the
force
of
magic
and
my
spells
no
faustus
thou
art
conjuror

that
canst
command
great
mephistophilis
quin

imagine
mephistophilis
like
a
franciscan
friar
mephist
now
faustus
what
wouldst
thou
have
me
do
faustus
i
charge
thee
wait
upon
me
whilst
i
live
to
do
whatever
faustus
shall
command
be
it
to
make
the
moon
drop
from
her
sphere
or
the
ocean
to
overwhelm
the
world
mephist
i
am
a
servant
to
great
lucifer
and
may
not
follow
thee
without
his
leave
no
more
than
he
commands
must
we
perform
faustus
did
not
he
charge
thee
to
appear
to
me
mephist
no
i
came
hither
of
mine
own
accord
faustus
did
not
my
conjuring
speeches
raise
thee
speak
mephist
that
was
the
cause
but
yet
per
accidens
for
when
we
hear
one
rack
the
name
of
god
abjure
the
scriptures
and
his
saviour
christ
we
fly
in
hope
to
get
his
glorious
soul
nor
will
we
come
unless
he
use
such
means
whereby
he
is
in
danger
to
be
damn
therefore
the
shortest
cut
for
conjuring
is
stoutly
to
abjure
the
trinity
and
pray
devoutly
to
the
prince
of
hell
faustus
so
faustus
hath
already
done
and
holds
this
principle
there
is
no
chief
but
only
belzebub
to
whom
faustus
doth
dedicate
himself
this
word
damnation
terrifies
not
him
for
he
confounds
hell
in
elysium
his
ghost
be
with
the
old
philosophers
but
leaving
these
vain
trifles
of
men
souls
tell
me
what
is
that
lucifer
thy
lord
mephist
and
commander
of
all
spirits
faustus
was
not
that
lucifer
an
angel
once
mephist
yes
faustus
and
most
dearly
lov
of
god
faustus
how
comes
it
then
that
he
is
prince
of
devils
mephist
o
by
aspiring
pride
and
insolence
for
which
god
threw
him
from
the
face
of
heaven
faustus
and
what
are
you
that
live
with
lucifer
mephist
unhappy
spirits
that
fell
with
lucifer
conspir
against
our
god
with
lucifer
and
are
for
ever
damn
with
lucifer
faustus
where
are
you
damn
mephist
in
hell
faustus
how
comes
it
then
that
thou
art
out
of
hell
mephist
why
this
is
hell
nor
am
i
out
of
it
thou
that
i
who
saw
the
face
of
god
and
tasted
the
eternal
joys
of
heaven
am
not
tormented
with
ten
thousand
hells
in
being
depriv
of
everlasting
bliss
o
faustus
leave
these
frivolous
demands
which
strike
a
terror
to
my
fainting
soul
faustus
what
is
great
mephistophilis
so
passionate
for
being
deprived
of
the
joys
of
heaven
learn
thou
of
faustus
manly
fortitude
and
scorn
those
joys
thou
never
shalt
possess
go

let
us
dispute
again
and
argue
of
divine
astrology
tell
me
are
there
many
heavens
above
the
moon
are
all
celestial
bodies
but
one
globe
as
is
the
substance
of
this
centric
earth
mephist
as
are
the
elements
such
are
the
spheres
mutually
folded
in
each
other
orb
and
faustus
all
jointly
move
upon
one
axletree
whose
terminine
is
term
the

wide
pole
nor
are
the

mars
or

feign
but
are
erring

have
they
all
one
motion
both
situ
et
tempore
mephist
all
jointly
move
from
east

faustus
tush
these
slender
trifles
wagner
can
decide
hath
mephistophilis
no
greater
skill
who
knows
not
the
double
motion
of
the
planets
the
first
is
finish
in
a
natural
day
the
second
thus
as
saturn
in
thirty
years
jupiter
in
twelve
mars
in
four
the
sun
venus
and
mercury
in
a
year
the
moon
in
days
tush
these
are
freshmen
suppositions

me
hath
every
sphere
a
dominion
or
intelligentia

me
in
this
question

emperor

and
a
knight
with
attendants
emperor
master
doctor
faustus
i
have
heard
strange
report
of
thy
knowledge
in
the
black
art
how
that
none
in
my
empire
nor
in
the
whole
world
can
compare
with
thee
for
the
rare
effects
of
magic
they
say
thou
hast
a
familiar
spirit
by
whom
thou
canst
accomplish
what
thou
list
this
therefore
is
my
request
that
thou
let
me
see
some
proof
of
thy
skill
that
mine
eyes
may
be
witnesses
to
confirm
what
mine
ears
have
heard
reported
and
here
i
swear
to
thee
by
the
honour
of
mine
imperial
crown
that
whatever
thou
doest
thou
shalt
be
no
ways
prejudiced
or
endamaged
knight
he
looks
much
like
a
conjurer
aside
faustus
my
gracious
sovereign
though
i
must
confess
myself
far
inferior
to
the
report
men
have
published
and
nothing
answerable
to
the
honour
of
your
imperial
majesty
yet
for
that
love
and
duty
binds
me
thereunto
i
am
content
to
do
whatsoever
your
majesty
shall
command
me
emperor
then
doctor
faustus
mark
what
i
shall
say
as
i
was
sometime
solitary
set
within
my
closet
sundry
thoughts
arose
about
the
honour
of
mine
ancestors
how
they
had
won
by
prowess
such
exploits
got
such
riches
subdu
so
many
kingdoms
as
we
that
do
succeed
or
they
that
shall
hereafter
possess
our
throne
shall
i
fear
me
attain
to
that
degree
of
high
renown
and
great
authority
amongst
which
kings
is
alexander
the
great
chief
spectacle
of
the
world
the
bright
shining
of
whose
glorious
acts
lightens
the
world
with
his
reflecting
beams
as
when
i
hear
but
motion
made
of
him
it
grieves
my
soul
i
never
saw
the
man
if
therefore
thou
by
cunning
of
thine
art
canst
raise
this
man
from
hollow
vaults
below
where
lies
entomb
this
famous
conqueror
and
bring
with
him
his
beauteous
paramour
both
in
their
right
shapes
gesture
and
attire
they
us
to
wear
during
their
time
of
life
thou
shalt
both
satisfy
my
just
desire
and
give
me
cause
to
praise
thee
whilst
i
live
faustus
my
gracious
lord
i
am
ready
to
accomplish
your
request
so
far
forth
as
by
art
and
power
of
my
spirit
i
am
able
to
perform
knight
that
just
nothing
at
all
aside
faustus
but
if
it
like
your
grace
it
is
not
in
my
ability
to
present
before
your
eyes
the
true
substantial
bodies
of
those
two
deceased
princes
which
long
since
are
consumed

dust

sign
of
grace
in
you
when
you
will
confess
the
truth
aside
faustus
but
such
spirits
as
can
lively
resemble
alexander
and
his
paramour
shall
appear
before
your
grace
in
that
manner
that
they
both
lived
in
in
their
most
flourishing
estate

not

imperial

went

againe

saying
now
if
it

you
shall
see
them
yet
upon
this
condition
that
you
demand
no
question
of
them
nor
speake
unto
them
which
the
emperor
agreed
unto
wherewith
doctor
faustus
opened
the
doore
where
presently
entered
the
great

mighty
emperor
alexander

in
all

he
had
a
compleat
harnesse
suit
of
armour
burnished
and
graven
exceeding
rich
to
look
upon
and
so
passing
towards
the
emperor
carolus
he
made
low
and
reverend
courtesie
whereat
the
emperour
carolus
would
have
stood
up
to
receive
and
greet
him
with
the
like
reverence
but
faustus
tooke
hold
on
him
and
would
not
permit
him
to
doe
it
shortly
after
alexander
made
humble
reverence
and
went
out
againe
and
comming
to
the
doore
his
paramour
met
him
she
comming
in
made
the
emperour
likewise
reverence
she
was
cloathed
in
blew
velvet
wrought

imbroidered
with
pearls
and

she
was
also
excellent
faire
like

mixed
tall

with
a

round

thus
passed

it

to

that
the

have
changed
themselves

have

deceived
me
calling
to
minde
the
woman
that
raised
the
prophet
samuel
and
for
that
the

would
be
the
more
satisfied
in
the
matter
he
said
i
have
often
heard
that
behind
in

neck
she
had
a

wherefore
he
tooke
faustus

without

went

he
offer
the

any

by

told

faustus
happening

asleep
leaning
out
of
a
window
of
the
great
hall
fixed
a
huge
pair
of

on

as
the

awaked
thinking

he
hit
his

thereof
flew

having
taken

was

he
was
attacked
in
a
wood

the
knight
and
some
of
his
companions
they
were
in
armour
and
mounted
on
fair
palfreys
but
the
doctor
quickly
overcame
them
by
turning
all
the
bushes
into
horsemen
and
so
charmed
them
that
every

said
to

gratious

i
have
alwayes
heard
that

doe
alwayes
long

i

therefore
your

hide
not
your
minde
from
me
but
tell
me
what
you
desire
to
eat
she
answered
him
doctor
faustus
now
truly
i
will
not
hide
from
you
what
my
heart
doth
most
desire
namely
that
if
it
were
now
harvest
i
would
eat
my
bellyfull
of
grapes
and
other
dainty
fruit
doctor
faustus
answered
hereupon
gracious
lady
this
is
a
small
thing
for
me
to
doe
for
i
can
doe
more
than
this
wherefore
he
tooke
a

set
open

holding

incontinent

and
white
grapes
peares
and
apples
the
which
came
from

all
these
he
presented
the

saying
madam
i
pray
you
vouchsafe
to
taste
of
this
dainty
fruit
the
which
came
from
a
farre
countrey
for
there
the
summer
is
not

ended
the
dutchesse
thanked
faustus
highly
and
she
fell
to
her
fruit
with
full
appetite
the
duke
of
anholt
notwithstanding
could
not
withhold
to
ask
faustus
with
what
reason
there
were
such
young
fruit
to
be
had
at
that
time
of

none

them
could
sleepe
for
that
they
att

nded
to
heare
if
they
might
be
privy
of

it
happened
that
betweene
twelve
and
one
a
clocke
at
midnight
there
blew
a
mighty
storme
of
winde
against
the
house
as
though
it
would
have
blowne
the
foundation
thereof
out
of
his
place
hereupon
the
students
began
to
feare
and
goe
out
of
their
beds
comforting
one
another
but
they
would
not
stirre
out
of
the
chamber
and
the
host
of
the
house
ran
out
of
doores
thinking
the
house
would
fall
the
students
lay
neere
unto
the
hall
wherein
doctor
faustus
lay
and
they
heard
a
mighty
noyse
and
hissing
as
if
the
hall
had
beene
full
of
snakes
and
adders
with
that
the
flew
open
wherein
doctor
faustus
was
that
he
began
to
cry
for
helpe
saying
murther

but
it
came
forth
with
halfe
a
voyce
hollowly
shortly
after
they
heard
him
no
more

when
it
was
day
the
students
that
had
taken
no
rest
that
night
arose
and
went
into
the
hall

left
doctor

a
pittifull
and
fearefull
sight

and
weepe
for
him
and
sought
for
his
body
in
many
places

into
the
yard
where
they
found
his
body
lying
on
the
most
monstrously
torne
and
fearefull
to
behold
for
his
head
and
all
his
joynts
were

the

and
masters
that
were
at
his
death

obtained
so
much
that

buried
him
in

was
so
grievously
tormented
after
the
which

returned
to
