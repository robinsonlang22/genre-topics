everybody
made
a
rush
for
the
train
the
zankiwank
and
the
bletherwitch
the
jackarandajam
mr
swinglebinks
they
were
run
into
by
a
demon
on
a
bicycle
birds
beasts
and
fishes
were
hurrying
by
in
confusing
masses
the
frogs
playing
kiss
in
the
ring
they
were
glued
to
the
earth
the
elfin
orchestra
i
have
dispatched
the
jackarandajam
and
mr
swinglebinks
in
a
cab
a
company
of
fairies
leapt
from
the
petals
of
the
flowers
the
sly
jackdaws
and
the
ravens
evidently
plotting
mischief
one
of
the
prettiest
dances
you
ever
saw
titania
arrived
with
a
full
train
of
fairies
and
elves
willie
pinched
his
exceedingly
thin
legs
making
him
jump
as
high
as
an
april
rainbow
peaseblossom
and
mustard
seed
queen
titania
and
her
court
of
fairies
were
eating
puddings
and
pies
the
two
children
tumbled
off
nothing
into
a
vacant
space
keep
the
pot
bawled
the
zankiwank
so
into
shadowland
they
tumbled
a
whole
school
of
children
following
madly
in
their
wake
the
goblins
started
off
on
horseback
the
unfortunate
doll
the
winny
weg
was
dancing
in
a
corner
all
by
herself
maude
and
willie
were
reclining
peacefully
on
a
golden
couch
with
silver
cushions
a
game
of
a
great
red
cavern
opened
and
swallowed
up
everything
now
then
move
on
the
wimble
and
the
wamble
jorumgander
the
younger
approached
them
with
a
case
of
pens
why
here
he
is
the
zankiwank
arguing
with
the
clerk
of
the
weather
and
the
weather
cock
time
was
meant
for
slaves
children
with
the
oddest
heads
and
faces
ever
seen
it
was
a
sort
of
skeleton
the
griffin
and
the
phoenix
they
sprang
into
the
hash
dr
pampleton
no
one
individual
got
his

was

opening
the

for
them
to
get

a
trip
to
fable
land
well
said
the
zankiwank
as
he
swallowed
another
jam
tart
i
think
we
had
better
start
on
our
travels
at
once
they
were
all
standing
under
the
clock
at
charing
cross
station
when
the
station
was
closed
and
everybody
else
had
departed
except
the
train
which
the
zankiwank
had
himself
chartered
it
was
all
so
odd
and
strange
and
the
gathering
was
so
very
motley
that
if
it
had
been
morning
instead
of
last
night
willie
and
maude
would
certainly
have
said
they
had
both
been
dreaming
but
of
course
they
were
not
dreaming
because
they
were
and
dressed
besides
they
remembered
charing
cross
station
quite
well
having
started
therefrom
with
their
father
and
mother
only
last
summer
when
they
went
to
the
for
their
holidays
and
what
jolly
times
they
had
on
the
sands
so
maude
said
promptly
it
is
not
or
dreams
or
anything
we
do
know
what
it
is
but
we
must
not
go
to
sleep
willie
in
case
anything
should
happen
willie
replied
that
he
did
not
want
to
go
to
sleep
any
more
i
believe
it
a
show
he
added
and
somebody
run
away
with
us
how
lovely
i
glad
we
are
lost
let
us
go
and
ask
that
tall
gentleman
who
looks
like
the
in
a
to
give
us
some
more
buns
for
being
a
boy
he
could
always
eat
buns
or
an
abundance
of
them
only
i
hope
you
wo
tell
the
nursery
governess
i
told
you
illustration
it
was
the
zankiwank
who
was
doing
some
conjuring
tricks
for
the
benefit
of
the
jackarandajam
and
mr
swinglebinks
to
whom
willie
referred
the
zankiwank
was
certainly
a
very
curious
person
to
look
at
he
had
very
long
legs
very
long
arms
and
a
very
small
body
a
long
neck
and
a
head
like
a
peacock
he
was
not
wearing
a
bathing
suit
as
willie
imagined
because
there
were
tails
to
his
jacket
hanging
down
almost
to
his
heels
he
wore
a
sash
round
his
waist
and
his
clothes
were
all
speckled
as
though
he
had
been
peppered
with
the
colours
out
of
a
very
large
kaleidoscope
the
jackarandajam
was
also
rather
tall
and
thin
but
dressed
in
the
very
height
of
fashion
with
a
flower
in
his
coat
and
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
which
he
never
smoked
because
he
never
lit
it
he
was
believed
by
all
the
others
you
shall
know
who
all
the
others
were
presently
to
know
more
things
than
the
because
he
nearly
always
said
something
that
nobody
else
ever
thought
of
and
the
knows
more
things
than
the
old
woman
of
mars
you
have
naturally
heard
all
about
mars
at
least
if
you
have
not
heard
all
about
her
you
all
have
heard
about
her
which
is
just
the
same
thing
only
reversed
there
was
an
old
woman
of
mars
who
constantly
say
bless
my
stars
there
the
sun
and
the
moon
and
the
earth
in
a
swoon
all
dying
for
of
this
planet
of
mine
called
mars
mr
swinglebinks
unlike
his
two
companions
was
short
stout
and
dreadfully
important
in
fable
land
where
we
are
going
as
soon
as
we
start
for
that
happy
place
he
kept
a
grocer
shop
once
upon
a
time
as
nobody
cared
a
fig
for
his
sugar
and
currants
however
he
retired
from
business
and
took
to
dates
and
the
making
of
new
almanacks
and
was
now
travelling
about
for
the
benefit
of
his
figures
he
was
very
strong
on
arithmetic
and
could
read
write
and
before
he
went
to
school
so
he
never
went
at
all
illustration
while
the
zankiwank
was
talking
to
his
friends
an
unseen
porter
rang
an
unseen
bell
and
called
out
in
an
unknown
tongue
take
your
seats
for
fableland
which
stands
upon
a
tableland
and
do
distress
the
guard
and
when
you
pass
the
cableland
say
nothing
to
the
gableland
because
it
hurts
the
guard
we
must
put
that
porter
back
in
the
bottle
said
the
jackarandajam
we
shall
want
some
bottled
porter
to
drink
on
the
road
well
said
maude
what
a
ridiculous
thing
to
say
we
do
bottle
railway
porters
i
am
sure
i
wish
the
bletherwitch
would
come
exclaimed
the
zankiwank
we
shall
miss
the
next
train
she
is
most
provoking
she
promised
to
be
here
three
weeks
ago
and
we
have
been
waiting
ever
since
this
astounding
statement
quite
disturbed
willie
who
almost
swallowed
a
bun
in
his
excitement
had
he
and
maude
been
waiting
there
three
weeks
as
well
what
would
they
think
at
home
you
see
maude
and
willie
who
were
brother
and
sister
had
been
on
a
visit
to
their
grandmama
and
on
their
way
home
they
had
fallen
asleep
in
the
carriage
after
having
repeated
to
each
other
all
the
wonderful
fairy
tales
their
grandmama
had
related
to
them
how
long
they
had
slept
they
could
not
guess
but
when
they
woke
up
instead
of
finding
themselves
at
home
in
st
square
they
discovered
that
they
were
at
charing
cross
station
mary
their
nurse
had
disappeared
so
had
john
the
coachman
and
it
was
the
zankiwank
who
had
opened
the
door
and
assisted
them
to
alight
saying
at
the
same
time
most
politely
i
assist
you
to
alight
because
it
is
so
dark
then
he
gave
them
buns
and
chocolates
icecreams
apples
pears
shrimps
and
cranberry
tarts
so
it
stands
to
reason
that
after
such
a
mixture
they
were
rather
perplexed
however
they
did
not
seem
very
much
distressed
and
as
they
were
both
fond
of
adventures
especially
in
books
they
were
quite
content
to
accept
the
zankiwank
offer
to
take
them
for
a
ride
in
the
to
fable
land
over
which
as
everybody
knows
king
Ã¦sop
reigns
maudie
was
nine
and
a
half
and
willie
was
eight
and
a
quarter
very
nice
ages
indeed
unless
you
happen
to
be
younger
or
older
and
then
your
own
age
is
nicer
still
i
think
said
the
zankiwank
that
we
will
start
without
the
bletherwitch
she
knows
the
way
and
can
take
a
balloon
if
she
takes
a
balloon
she
will
lose
it
you
had
better
let
the
balloon
take
her
exclaimed
the
jackarandajam
severely
take
your
places
take
your
places
cried
the
unseen
porter
so
everybody
made
a
rush
for
the
train
and
they
all
entered
a
pullman
car
and
sat
down
on
the
seats
dear
me
how
very
incorrectly
that
porter
speaks
he
means
of
course
that
the
seats
should
take
or
receive
us
the
zankiwank
only
smiled
while
mr
swinglebinks
commenced
counting
up
to
a
hundred
but
as
he
lost
one
he
could
only
count
up
to
so
to
keep
his
arithmetic
going
he
subtracted
a
from
his
neighbour
pocket
multiplied
his
and
divided
his
attention
between
the
wimble
and
the
wamble
who
were
both
of
the
party
being
and
deaf
maudie
and
willie
took
their
places
in
the
car
with
all
the
other
passengers
amid
a
perfect
babel
of
chattering
and
laughing
and
crying
and
then
as
the
train
began
to
slowly
move
out
of
the
station
the
zankiwank
solemnly
sang
the
following
serious
song
off
to
fable
land
the
midnight
train
departs
at
three
to
fable
land
we
go
for
this
express
is
nothing
less
than
a
steamer
do
you
know
we
sailing
now
upon
the
thames
all
in
a
penny
boat
and
we
soon
shall
change
for
a
mountain
range
in
the
atmosphere
to
float
so
off
we
go
to
fable
land
speak
kindly
to
the
guard
which
many
think
a
but
this
you
disregard
you
find
it
is
a
with
stables
in
the
yard
a
possible
probable
so
do
not
vex
the
guard
we
left
behind
us
charing
cross
and
all
the
town
in
bed
for
it
is
plain
though
in
this
train
we
standing
on
our
head
we
riding
now
in
bedfordshire
which
is
the
land
of
nod
and
yet
in
the
sky
we
are
flying
high
which
seems
extremely
odd
so
off
we
go
to
fable
land
speak
kindly
to
the
guard
which
many
think
a
but
this
you
disregard
you
find
it
is
a
with
stables
in
the
yard
a
possible
probable
so
do
not
vex
the
guard
maudie
and
willie
found
themselves
joining
lustily
in
the
chorus
when
the
zankiwank
pulled
the
cord
communicating
with
the
guard
and
opening
the
window
climbed
out
on
to
the
top
of
the
carriage
calling
all
the
time
guard
guard
guard
do
go
so
hard
just
give
the
brake
a
hitch
to
charing
cross
return
nay
do
not
look
so
stern
for
i
would
not
tell
a
cram
i
must
send
a
telegram
to
my
darling
little
bletherwitch
so
the
guard
turned
the
train
round
and
they
went
back
to
charing
cross
as
quick
as
lightning
it
my
fault
moaned
the
jackarandajam
i
ought
to
have
reminded
you
never
mind
we
will
put
on
another
engine
so
the
zankiwank
got
out
and
sent
a
telegram
to
the
bletherwitch
and
desired
her
to
follow
on
in
a
balloon
again
they
started
and
everybody
settled
down
until
the
train
reached
the
british
channel
when
it
dived
through
a
tunnel
into
an
uninhabited
country
where
the
clerk
popped
his
head
into
the
carriage
window
and
handed
in
a
telegram
the
bletherwitch
to
the
do
wait
tea
gone
to
the
dentists
extremely
thoughtful
exclaimed
everybody
but
the
zankiwank
wept
and
explained
to
the
sympathetic
maude
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
the
bletherwitch
and
he
had
been
waiting
for
her
for
fourteen
years
such
a
charming
creature
i
will
introduce
you
when
she
comes
fancy
she
is
only
two
feet
one
inch
and
one
third
high
such
a
suitable
height
for
a
bride
what
expostulated
willie
and
maude
together
she
no
bigger
than
our
baby
and
you
are
quite
eight
feet
and
one
half
of
an
inch
how
disproportionate
it
seems
to
me
to
be
a
most
unequal
match
answered
maude
what
does
her
mother
say
oh
she
has
got
any
mother
you
know
that
would
not
do
she
has
been
asleep
for
two
thousand
years
and
has
only
just
woke
up
to
the
fact
that
i
am
her
destiny
she
is
only
joking
declared
maude
two
thousand
years
she
be
joking
no
replied
the
zankiwank
somewhat
sadly
she
is
not
joking
she
never
jokes
she
is
of
scottish
descent
he
added
reflectively
i
hope
she
will
keep
her
appointment
i
am
afraid
she
is
rather
giddy
giddy
well
if
she
has
waited
two
thousand
years
before
making
up
her
mind
to
go
to
the
dentists
she
must
be
giddy
i
am
afraid
you
are
not
speaking
the
truth
before
any
reply
could
be
given
the
guard
came
to
the
window
and
said
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
charing
cross
again
as
he
forgot
to
pay
his
rent
and
he
always
paid
his
rent
on
monday
but
this
is
monday
said
willie
yesterday
was
monday
is
you
know
therefore
it
is
tuesday
pay
your
landlady
double
next
monday
and
that
will
do
just
as
well
the
guard
hesitated
do
vex
the
guard
they
all
said
in
chorus
i
am
not
vexed
said
the
guard
touching
his
hat
do
you
think
it
would
be
right
to
pay
double
you
see
my
landlady
is
single
she
might
not
like
it
write
o
u
on
a
and
send
it
to
her
it
will
do
just
as
well
if
not
better
suggested
mr
swinglebinks
so
the
guard
sent
the
but
in
his
agitation
he
told
the
engineer
driver
to
go
straight
ahead
instead
of
round
the
corner
the
consequence
was
that
they
were
run
into
by
a
demon
on
a
bicycle
and
thrown
out
of
the
train
down
a
coal
mine
luckily
there
were
no
coals
in
the
mine
so
it
did
not
matter
and
they
went
boldly
forward
that
is
to
say
willie
and
maude
did
and
knocked
at
the
front
door
of
a
handsome
house
that
suddenly
appeared
before
them
illustration
nobody
opened
the
door
so
they
walked
in
they
looked
behind
them
but
could
not
see
the
zankiwank
or
any
of
the
passengers
in
the
train
therefore
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
they
went
upstairs
they
appeared
to
be
walking
up
stairs
for
hours
without
coming
to
a
landing
or
meeting
with
anyone
and
the
interminable
steps
began
to
grow
monotonous
presently
they
heard
a
scuffling
and
a
stamping
and
a
roaring
behind
them
and
something
or
somebody
began
to
push
them
most
rudely
until
at
last
the
wall
gave
way
the
stairs
gave
way
they
gave
way
and
tumbled
right
on
to
the
tips
of
their
noses
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
screamed
a
chorus
of
curious
voices
and
maude
and
willie
found
themselves
taken
by
the
hand
by
a
dwarf
with
a
swivel
eye
and
an
elevated
proboscis
and
led
out
of
danger
the
children
could
not
help
gazing
upon
their
preserver
who
was
so
grotesquely
formed
with
a
humped
back
twisted
legs
very
long
arms
and
such
a
funny
little
body
without
any
neck
but
his
eyes
atoned
for
everything
they
sparkled
and
glinted
in
their
sockets
like
bright
brown
diamonds
only
there
are
no
brown
diamonds
you
know
only
white
and
pink
ones
illustration
the
dwarf
did
not
appear
to
mind
the
wondering
looks
of
the
children
at
all
but
patted
them
on
the
cheeks
and
told
them
not
to
be
frightened
but
whether
he
meant
frightened
of
himself
or
of
the
birds
beasts
and
fishes
that
were
hurrying
by
in
such
confusing
masses
they
could
not
tell
one
thing
however
that
astonished
them
very
much
was
the
deference
with
which
they
greeted
their
quaint
rescuer
as
they
passed
by
for
every
creature
from
the
lion
to
the
mouse
bowed
most
politely
as
they
approached
him
and
then
went
on
their
way
gaily
frisking
for
this
was
their
weekly
how
do
you
like
my
menagerie
enquired
the
dwarf
rough
and
ready
perhaps
but
as
docile
as
a
if
you
treat
them
properly
it
is
just
like
the
zoo
declared
willie
or
the
animals
in
fables
suggested
maude
this
delighted
the
dwarf
very
much
for
though
he
looked
so
serious
he
was
full
of
good
humour
and
skipped
about
with
much
agility
good
good
he
cried
Ã¦sop
and
the
zoo
ha
ha
he
he
anybody
can
be
a
zoo
but
only
one
can
be
Ã¦sop
and
i
am
he
Ã¦sop
are
you
really
mr
Ã¦sop
the
phrygian
philosopher
cried
maude
Ã¦sop
i
should
say
corrected
willie
i
am
glad
we
have
met
you
because
now
perhaps
you
will
kindly
tell
us
what
a
fable
really
is
a
fable
said
the
merry
Ã¦sop
with
a
twinkle
in
his
witty
eyes
is
a
fictitious
story
about
nothing
that
ever
happened
related
by
nobody
that
ever
lived
and
the
moral
is
that
every
one
is
quite
innocent
only
they
must
not
do
it
again
ah
that
is
only
your
fun
said
willie
sagely
because
of
the
moral
why
do
they
give
you
so
many
morals
i
do
know
answered
Ã¦sop
gravely
but
the
commentators
and
editors
do
give
a
lot
of
applications
and
morals
to
the
tales
of
my
animals
do
they
i
like
a
tale
with
a
moral
averred
maude
it
finishes
everything
up
so
satisfactorily
i
think
now
mr
Ã¦sop
as
you
know
so
much
please
tell
us
what
a
proverb
is
ah
replied
mr
Ã¦sop
i
do
make
proverbs
there
are
too
many
already
but
a
proverb
usually
seems
to
me
to
be
something
you
always
theoretically
remember
to
practically
forget
neither
of
the
children
quite
understood
this
though
maude
thought
it
was
what
her
papa
would
call
satire
and
satire
was
such
a
strange
word
that
she
could
never
fully
comprehend
the
meaning
willie
was
silent
too
like
his
sister
and
seeing
them
deep
in
thought
king
Ã¦sop
waved
a
little
wand
he
had
in
his
hand
and
all
the
birds
and
beasts
and
fishes
joined
hands
and
paws
and
fins
and
wings
and
danced
in
a
circle
singing
to
the
music
of
a
quantity
of
piping
birds
in
the
trees
if
you
want
to
be
merry
and
wise
you
must
all
be
as
bright
as
you
can
you
never
must
quarrel
or
spoil
a
right
moral
but
live
on
a
regular
plan
you
must
read
write
and
or
you
never
grow
up
to
be
good
and
you
must
say
wo
or
i
sha
and
i
do
or
disturb
the
indicative
mood
so
round
about
the
knowledge
tree
each
boy
and
girl
must
go
to
learn
in
school
the
golden
rule
and
duty
line
to
toe
if
you
want
to
be
clever
and
smart
you
must
also
be
ready
for
play
and
do
be
too
subtle
when
batting
your
shuttle
but
sport
in
a
frolicsome
way
with
bat
and
with
ball
take
your
part
or
with
little
doll
perched
on
your
knee
you
sing
all
the
time
to
a
nursery
rhyme
before
you
go
in
to
your
tea
so
round
about
the
sunset
tree
each
boy
and
girl
should
go
to
play
a
game
of
what
its
name
that
is
each
game
you
know
after
merrily
joining
in
this
very
original
song
with
dancing
accompaniment
maude
and
willie
thanked
king
Ã¦sop
for
permitting
his
animals
to
entertain
them
always
glad
to
please
good
little
boys
and
girls
you
know
he
replied
pleasantly
even
in
their
play
they
furnish
us
with
a
new
fable
and
a
moral
and
that
is
all
play
and
no
work
makes
the
world
stand
still
illustration
before
they
could
ask
for
an
explanation
their
attention
was
once
more
drawn
to
the
animals
who
had
commenced
playing
all
kinds
of
games
just
the
same
as
they
themselves
played
in
the
at
school
the
toads
were
playing
the
elephants
and
the
bears
fly
the
garter
the
dromedaries
hi
spie
hi
while
the
snakes
were
trundling
their
hoops
the
lions
and
the
lambs
were
playing
at
cricket
with
the
donkeys
as
fielders
and
the
wombat
as
umpire
the
frogs
were
in
a
corner
by
themselves
playing
kiss
in
the
ring
and
crying
out
it
is
you
it
is
you
we
none
of
us
know
what
to
do
in
a
very
manner
then
the
storks
and
the
cranes
and
the
geese
and
the
ganders
were
standing
in
a
circle
singing
sally
sally
waters
sitting
in
the
moon
with
the
camel
daughters
all
through
the
afternoon
oh
sally
bo
sally
where
your
dusting
pan
my
sally
fie
sally
here
is
your
young
man
in
another
part
the
crabs
the
sheep
and
the
fox
were
vowing
that
london
bridge
was
broken
down
because
they
had
not
which
seemed
a
curious
reason
then
all
the
rest
of
the
wild
creatures
birds
beasts
and
fishes
commenced
an
extraordinary
dance
singing
croaking
flapping
their
fins
and
spreading
their
wings
to
these
words
we
are
a
crowd
of
jolly
boys
all
romping
on
the
lea
we
always
make
this
merry
noise
when
we
return
from
sea
so
we
go
round
and
round
and
round
because
we
come
ashore
for
topsy
turvey
we
are
bound
so
round
again
once
more
go
in
and
out
of
the
coppice
go
in
and
out
at
the
door
and
do
not
wake
the
poppies
who
want
to
have
a
snore
it
was
too
ridiculous
they
could
recognise
every
animal
they
had
read
about
in
Ã¦sop
and
they
were
all
behaving
in
a
manner
they
little
dreamed
could
be
possible
out
of
a
but
it
certainly
was
not
a
though
they
could
distinguish
several
horses
and
ponies
illustration
they
never
seemed
to
stop
in
their
games
and
even
the
ants
and
the
gnats
were
playing
and
above
all
a
game
of
football
though
as
some
played
according
to
association
and
some
to
rugby
rules
of
course
it
was
rather
perplexing
to
the
when
they
grew
tired
of
watching
the
animal
world
enjoying
their
holiday
they
turned
to
consult
king
Ã¦sop
but
to
their
astonishment
he
was
not
near
them
he
had
vanished
and
when
they
turned
round
the
other
way
the
animals
had
vanished
too
and
they
were
quite
alone
indeed
everything
seemed
to
disappear
even
the
light
that
had
been
their
guide
so
long
and
they
began
to
tremble
with
fear
and
apprehension
not
a
sound
was
to
be
heard
and
darkness
gradually
fell
around
them
they
held
each
other
by
the
hand
and
determined
to
go
forward
but
to
their
dismay
they
could
not
move
they
were
glued
to
the
earth
they
tried
to
speak
but
their
tongues
stuck
to
the
roofs
of
their
mouths
and
they
were
in
great
distress
where
oh
where
was
the
zankiwank
they
wondered
in
their
thoughts
and
a
buzzing
in
their
ears
took
up
the
refrain
the
zankiwank
the
zankiwank
oh
where
oh
where
is
the
zankiwank
he
brought
us
here
and
much
we
fear
his
conduct
far
from
the
zankiwank
the
zankiwank
he
has
gone
to
seek
the
bletherwitch
oh
the
zankiwank
is
a
panky
prank
to
leave
us
here
to
die
in
a
ditch
a
telegram
did
you
say
for
me
of
course
what
an
age
you
have
been
how
is
my
blushing
bride
let
me
see
the
bletherwitch
nonsuch
street
to
the
zankiwank
forgot
my
new
shoes
and
the
housemaid
killed
the
parrot
put
the
kettle
on
then
the
children
heard
some
sobbing
sound
soughing
through
the
silence
and
they
knew
that
they
were
saved
also
that
the
zankiwank
was
weeping
so
with
a
strong
effort
maude
managed
to
call
out
consolingly
zankiwanky
dear
do
cry
come
and
let
me
comfort
you
but
the
zankiwank
refused
to
be
comforted
however
he
came
forward
muttering
an
incantation
of
some
sort
and
maude
and
willie
finding
themselves
free
rushed
forward
and
greeted
him
hush
my
dears
the
nargalnannacus
is
afloat
on
the
wild
wild
main
we
must
be
careful
and
depart
or
he
will
turn
us
into

unpleasant

may
be
the
next

it
is
close
at

to
the
ship

is
waiting
in
the
bay
window
and
we
will
go
and
get
some
floranges
carefully
maudie
and
willie
followed
the
zankiwank
each
holding
on
by
the
tails
of
his
coat
glad
enough
to
go
anywhere
out
of
the
blackness
of
the
dark
soon
they
found
themselves
in
window
bay
and
climbing
up
the
sides
of
a
mighty
ship
with
five
funnels
and
a
captain
quick
called

for

mind
the

then
the
zankiwank
became
the
man
at
the
wheel
and
the
vessel
scudded
before
the
wind

the
two
children
went
off
into
a
trance

and

could
not

how
long
it
took
them
to

them

any
boy

children
experienced
that
curious
sensation
of
feeling
asleep
while
they
were
wide
awake
and
feeling
wide
awake
when
they
imagined
themselves
to
be
asleep
just
as
one
does
feel
sometimes
in
the
early
morning

the
sun
is
beginning
to
peep
through
the
blinds

the

they
were
no
longer
on

had
borne
them
away
from

the
nargalnannacus
a
fearsome
creature
whom
nobody
has
yet
seen
although
most
of
us
may
not
have
heard
about
him
the
obliging
zankiwank
was
with
them
and
when
they
looked
round
they
found
themselves
in
a
square
field
festooned
with
the
misty
curtains
of
the
elfin
dawn

said
the
zankiwank
this
is
midsummer

very
soon
it
will
be
midsummer
night
and
you
will
see
some
wonders
that
will

before

illustration
both
children
would
have
liked
to
argue
out
this
speech
of
the
zankiwank
because
it
puzzled
them
and
they
felt
it
would
not
parse
properly
however
as
just
at
that
moment
the
elfin
orchestra
appeared
they
sat
on
the
grass
and
listened

this
is
the

the

lovely

all
they
could
say

every
wild
flower
they
could
think

to
be
seen
in
this
beautiful
place
with
the
purling
stream
running
down
the

crossed
by
innumerable

far
away
they
could
see

ever
sending
upward
its
cooling
sprays

i
think
i
shall
spend
my
honeymoon
here
said
the
zankiwank
i
have
already
bought
a
honeycomb
for
my
bride
i
am
so
impatient
to
have
her
by
my
side
that
i
have
dispatched
the
jackarandajam
and
mr
swinglebinks
in
a
cab
to
fetch
her
when
the
bletherwitch
arrives
i
will
introduce
you
and
you
shall
both
be
bridesmaids
but
i
ca
be
a
bridesmaid
you
know
corrected
willie
oh
yes
you
can
you
can
be
anything
here
you
like
you
only
have
to
eat
some
fern
seeds
and
you
become
invisible
and
nobody
would
know
you
it
is
so
simple
and
saves
a
lot
of
argument
and
you
should
never
argue
about
anything
unless
you
know
nothing
about
it
then
you
are
sure
to
win
but
interrupted
maude
how
can
you
know
nothing
about
anything
is
the
easiest
thing
out
of
the
world
said
the
zankiwank
what
is
nothing
nothing
precisely
nothing
is
nothing
but
what
is
better
than
nothing
something
wrong
wrong
wrong
where
is
your
logic
nothing
is
better
than
something
i
prove
it
nothing
is
sweeter
than
honey
nothing
more
bitter
than
gall
nothing
that
comic
is
funny
nothing
is
shorter
than
tall
that
is
nonsense
and
nothing
to
do
with
the
case
exclaimed
maude
nonsense
nonsense
did
you
say
nonsense
of
course
she
did
said
willie
and
so
do
i
nonsense
to
me
do
you
forget
what
my
name
is
oh
no
nothing
easier
than
to
remember
it
you
are
the
great
zankiwank
thank
you
i
am
satisfied
i
thought
you
had
forgotten
i
am
not
cross
with
you
maude
and
willie
vowed
they
would
not
cross
him
for
anything
let
alone
nothing
and
so
the
zankiwank
was
appeased
and
offered
to
give
them
the
correct
answer
to
his
own
unanswerable
conundrum
do
you
know
what
a
conundrum
is
though
i
will
tell
you
while
the
zankiwank
is
curling
his
whiskers
a
conundrum
is
an
impossible
question
with
an
improbable
answer
think
it
over
the
next
time
you
read
robinson
crusoe
nothing
is
better
than
a
good
little
girl
but
a
jam
tart
is
better
than
nothing
therefore
a
jam
tart
is
better
than
the
best
little
girl
alive
what
do
you
think
of
that
said
the
zankiwank
i
have
heard
something
like
it
before
but
that
is
nothing
anyhow
i
would
much
rather
be
a
little
girl
than
a
jam
tart
because
a
jam
tart
must
be
sour
because
it
tart
and
a
little
girl
is
always
sweet
promptly
replied
willie
kissing
his
sister
maude
on
the
nose
but
that
was
an
accident
because
she
moved
at
the
wrong
moment
you
distress
me
said
the
zankiwank
suppose
i
were
to
try
to
shoot
folly
as
it
flies
and
hit
a
fool
cap
and
bells
instead
what
would
you
say
i
should
say
that
you
had
shot
at
nothing
and
missed
it
illustration
at
this
maude
and
willie
laughed
girlsterously
and
boysterously
and
the
zankiwank
wept
three
silent
tears
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
and
declared
that
nothing
took
his
fancy
so
much
as
having
nothing
to
take
so
they
took
him
by
the
arm
and
begged
him
as
he
was
so
clever
and
had
mentioned
the
name
to
take
them
to
fancy
i
think
fancy
must
dwell
amongst
the
wild
flowers
the
sweet
beautiful
wild
flowers
that
grow
in
such
charming
variety
of
disorder
saying
this
maude
took
willie
hand
and
urged
the
zankiwank
forward
before
the
zankiwank
could
reply
a
company
of
fairies
all
dressed
in
pink
and
green
leapt
from
the
petals
of
the
flowers
and
danced
forward
singing
to
the
buzz
of
the
bees
and
the
breaking
note
of
the
with
his
bright
gamboge
breast
where
is
fancy
bred
o
would
you
know
where
fancy
dwells
and
where
she
flaunts
her
head
come
to
the
dells
and
seek
her
in
her
bed
for
fancy
is
a
maiden
sweet
with
all
a
maiden
whims
as
quick
as
thought
as
magic
fleet
like
gossamer
she
skims
o
seek
among
the
birds
and
bees
and
search
among
the
buds
in
babbling
brook
in
silver
seas
or
in
the
raging
floods
gaze
upward
to
the
starry
vault
or
ask
the
golden
sun
though
ever
you
will
be
at
fault
before
your
task
is
done
o
would
you
know
where
fancy
dwells
it
is
not
in
the
it
is
not
in
the
chime
of
bells
nor
in
the
waking
hours
it
is
not
in
the
learnÃ«d
brain
nor
in
the
busy
mart
it
lives
not
with
the
false
and
vain
but
in
the
tender
heart
as
mysteriously
as
they
had
appeared
the
fairies
vanished
again
and
only
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
and
the
twittering
of
the
birds
making
melody
all
around
reminded
the
children
that
they
were
on
enchanted
ground
now
and
then
the
would
set
up
a
croaking
chorus
in
some
marshy
land
far
behind
but
as
no
one
could
distinguish
what
they
said
it
did
not
matter
o
to
be
here
for
ever
with
the
fairy
band
o
to
wake
up
never
from
this
dreamy
land
for
the
humblest
plant
is
weighted
with
some
new
perfume
and
the
scent
of
the
air
drops
like
some
prayer
and
mingles
with
the
bloom
o
to
be
here
for
ever
and
never
never
wake
was
that
the
music
of
the
spheres
they
wondered
somehow
it
seemed
as
though
their
own
hearts
echo
played
to
the
words
that
fell
so
soft
like
a
fair
sweet
tender
melody
of
fairies
long
ago
the
zankiwank
had
left
them
again
to
send
another
telegram
perhaps
and
maude
and
willie
went
rambling
through
the
meadow
and
down
by
the
brook
where
they
gathered
nuts
and
berries
and
sat
them
down
to
enjoy
a
rural
feast
tiny
elves
and
fairies
were
constantly
coming
and
going
some
driving
in
wee
chariots
with
ants
for
horses
and
oak
leaves
for
carriages
and
while
all
the
other
flowers
seemed
quite
gay
and
merry
in
the
sunshine
the
poppies
were
nodding
their
scarlet
heads
and
gently
dozing
what
time
some
wild
holly
hocks
beat
to
and
fro
murmuring
sleep
sleep
sleep
while
the
corn
is
ready
to
reap
sleep
sleep
sleep
and
the
lightest
hours
sleep
sleep
sleep
on
the
edge
of
the
misty
deep
as
they
lay
upon
the
bank
to
their
surprise
a
procession
of
birds
came
along
the
two
foremost
being
fine
handsome
thrushes
carrying
a
large
banner
of
ivy
leaves
on
which
was
inscribed
in
letters
of
red
clover
the
following
legend
of
birds
from
london
and
the
suburbs
fancy
said
maude
all
the
birds
of
london
town
come
to
for
a
change
of
air
and
why
not
asked
a
saucy
we
ca
be
always
singing
the
same
song
so
we
come
here
for
a
change
of
air
and
of
course
when
we
get
a
change
of
air
we
return
with
new
melodies
if
you
were
to
reed
your
books
properly
you
would
know
that
the
pipes
of
our
organs
our
vocal
organs
want
tuning
occasionally
then
without
any
warning
they
all
struck
up
a
new
song
and
marvel
of
marvels
instead
of
merely
singing
like
ordinary
birds
they
sang
the
words
as
well
but
before
giving
you
the
lyric
that
they
voiced
so
melodiously
i
must
tell
you
the
names
of
some
of
the
birds
they
saw
and
if
you
live
in
london
or
any
large
town
you
will
perhaps
know
several
of
them
by
sight
as
well
as
by
cognomen
first
in
the
throng
were
the
and
the
song
thrushes
the
redwing
and
the
fieldfare
the
blackbird
and
the
redstart
and
the
redbreast
with
faithful
jenny
wren
the
large
family
of
titmouse
and
the
merry
with
his
pleasant
little
song
of
the
humoursome
wagtails
and
that
rare
visitant
the
waxwing
hopped
along
together
followed
by
the
swallows
and
the
martins
and
a
whole
posse
of
finches
of
various
orders
particularly
the
chaffinches
who
were
joking
with
the
linnets
illustration
then
came
the
noisy
starlings
the
magpies
and
the
sparrows
chattering
incessantly
and
evidently
talking
scandal
the
sly
jackdaws
and
the
ravens
looking
as
sleek
as
sunday
sextons
but
evidently
plotting
mischief
were
also
present
in
close
proximity
to
the
rooks
and
the
crows
who
were
well
able
to
take
care
of
their
own
caws
afterwards
came
the
swifts
and
the
larks
up
to
all
sorts
of
games
a
few
woodpeckers
joined
their
feathered
friends
and
one
cuckoo
was
there
because
willie
heard
him
but
he
kept
somewhere
in
the
background
as
usual
owls
and
bats
and
millards
with
wigeons
and
pigeons
brought
up
the
rear
with
a
few
plovers
including
the
lapwing
jack
snipe
came
tumbling
after
in
a
hurry
with
a
stranger
called
the
whimbrel
and
a
puffin
out
of
breath
there
were
other
birds
as
well
but
i
do
think
you
would
know
them
if
i
mentioned
them
maude
and
willie
did
not
and
they
were
quite
authorities
on
ornithology
and
perhaps
you
are
not
the
song
of
the
birds
we
are
the
birds
of
london
town
come
out
to
take
the
air
to
change
our
coats
of
grey
and
brown
and
trim
our
feathers
rare
for
london
fogs
so
very
black
our

disarrange

we

piping

after
this
very
entertaining
song
each
bird
stood
on
one
leg
spread
one
wing
and
joined
partners
for
one
of
the
prettiest
dances
you
ever
saw
it
was
called
the
birds
quadrille
and
was
so
charmingly
executed
that
even
the
flowers
left
their
beds
and
borders
to
look
on
the
fairies
peeping
meanwhile
from
the
buds
to
join
in
the
general
enjoyment
the
voices
of
the
flowers
were
lifted
in
gentle
cadences
to
the
rhythm
of
the
feathered
dancers
featly
twists
and
turns
illustration
how
happy
the
children
felt
in
this
beautiful
place
with
all
nature
vieing
to
show
her
sweetest
charms
and
how
rich
and
rare
were
the
gems
of
foliage
and
tree
and
humble
creeping
plants
how
easy
to
forget
everything
but
joy
in
this
fairy
paradise
that
fancy
so
deftly
pictured
for
them
could
there
be
anything
sad
in
flower
land
they
could
not
believe
it
possible
and
yet
when
a
tiny
little
fairy
stepped
from
a
cluster
of
wild
flowers
and
sang
them
the
song
of
the
lily
and
the
rose
diamond
tears
stole
down
the
cheeks
of
the
little
lass
and
the
little
lad
the
rose
and
the
lily
a
tender
rose
so
pretty
and
sleek
loved
a
lily
pure
and
white
and
paid
his
court
with
breathings
meek
watching
her
day
and
night
while
the
lily
bowed
her
virgin
head
the
rose
his
message
sent
the
lily
clung
to
her
lover
red
and
gave
her
shy
consent
the
violets
cooed
and
the
rang
and
the
jasmine
shook
with
glee
while
the
birds
high
in
the
branches
sang
forget
not
true
to
be
dear
flora
came
the
wedding
to
see
the
cowslips
had
decked
the
bride
the
red
rose
trembled
so
nervously
his
blushes
he
could
not
hide
the
daisies
opened
their
wee
white
eyes
the
pinks
came
down
in
rows
the
lily
cries
my
own
my
sweet
moss
rose
the
violets
cooed
and
the
rang
and
the
jasmine
shook
with
glee
while
the
birds
high
in
the
branches
sang
o
may
you
happy
be
the
were
gathered
there
and
every
plant
as
well
to
attend
the
wedding
of
this
pair
so
sweet
that
no
pen
can
tell
but
a
cruel
wind
came
sweeping
by
the
lily
drooped
and
died
then
the
red
rose
gave
one
tearful
sigh
and
joined
his
lily
bride
the
violets
wept
and
the
sobbed
the
myrtle
and
jasmine
sighed
the
birds
were
hushed
as
their
hearts
all
throbbed
at
the
death
of
the
rose
bride
before
the
children
had
time
to
grow
too
sorrowful
there
was
a
fluttering
in
the
air
and
a
rushing
among
the
plants
and
flowers
as
the
zankiwank
bounded
into
their
presence
cutting
so
many
capers
that
they
were
glad
they
were
not
to
have
mutton
for
dinner
as
certainly
all
the
capers
would
be
destroyed
the
zankiwank
was
in
very
high
spirits
and
gleefully
announced
that
the
court
of
the
fairies
with
the
queen
was
coming
as
sally
who
lived
in
somebody
alley
had
just
informed
him
then
he
burst
out
singing
to
a
tune
which
i
daresay
you
all
know
the
following
foolish
words
of
all
the
flowers
that
are
so
smart
there
none
like
daffydilly
she
be
the
darling
of
my
heart
but
she
has
grown
so
silly
there
is
no
wild
flower
in
the
land
that
half
so
tame
as
daisy
to
her
i
give
my
heart
and
hand
but
fear
i
drive
her
crazy
and
then
there
is
the
cabbage
rose
also
the
china
aster
but
buttercup
with
yellow
nose
would
cause
jealous
disaster
o
violet
dear
primrose
you
know
my
passion
for
all
the
plants
afar
anear
i
court
in
flowery
fashion
oh
please
be
serious
cried
willie
is
the
matter
with
you
mr
zankiwank
you
will
perceive
that
willie
and
maude
were
quite
at
home
in
their
new
surroundings
and
nothing
seemed
to
surprise
them
one
whit
not
even
the
unexpected
which
they
constantly
anticipated
illustration
the
zankiwank
only
asked
permission
to
send
one
more
telegram
to
the
bletherwitch
and
then
he
condescended
to
inform
them
that
queen
titania
was
about
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
sure
enough
before
he
had
done
speaking
titania
arrived
all
the
way
from
athens
with
a
full
train
of
fairies
and
elves
accompanied
by
a
fairy
band
playing
fairy
music
robin
goodfellow
skipped
in
advance
while
peaseblossom
cobweb
moth
and
attended
on
the
lovely
queen
indeed
indeed
this
must
be
a
midsummer
night
dream
indeed
and
indeed
then
it
is
mocked
the
impudent
robin
goodfellow
the
fairies
are
not
dead
yet
and
they
never
will
die
while
good
little
girls
and
boys
and
poets
with
sweet
imaginations
live
but
quick
let
not
the
queen
see
you
eat
of
these
fern
seeds
and
you
will
become
invisible
even
to
the
fairies
they
are
special
seeds
of
my
own
growing
and
warranted
to
last
as
long
as
i
choose
so
maude
and
willie
ate
of
the
fern
seeds
and
became
invisible
even
to
the
zankiwank
who
was
dreadfully
distressed
and
went
about
calling
them
by
name
in
a
spirit
of
mischief
willie
pinched
his
exceedingly
thin
legs
making
him
jump
as
high
as
an
april
and
causing
him
to
be
called
to
order
by
the
court
usher
illustration
and
now
said
titania
waving
her
wand
and
calling
the
flowers
and
birds
to
her
court
let
the
jackdaw
sing
his
war
song
illustration
if
you
please
your
majesty
i
have
left
the
music
at
home
and
forgotten
the
words
pleaded
the
jackdaw
very
well
then
sing
it
without
either
or
you
shall
not
have
a
new
coat
until
the
spring
so
the
jackdaw
stepped
forth
and
sang
as
below
while
the
rook
irreverently
cleared
his
throat
above
for
his
friend
and
cried
caw
caw
the
jackdaw
jest
if
peaches
grew
on
apple
trees
and
frogs
were
made
of
glass
and
bulls
and
cows
were
turned
to
bees
and
rooks
were
made
of
grass
if
boys
and
girls
were
made
of
figs
if
figs
were
made
of
dates
upon
the
sands
they
dance
like
grigs
with
bald
and
oval
pates
if
mortals
had
got
proper
sense
and
were
not
quite
so
mad
their
mood
would
make
them
more
intense
to
make
each
other
glad
if
only
they
would
understand
the
things
that
no
one
knows
they
live
like
fairies
in
the
land
and
never
come
to
blows
that
a
very
nice
war
song
it
so
peaceful
and
soothing
spake
the
queen
and
now
call
the
poets
from
freeland
this
is
the
time
for
them
to
renew
their
licences
though
i
greatly
fear
that
they
have
been
taking
so
many
liberties
of
late
that
any
licence
i
can
give
them
will
prove
superfluous
superfluous
superfluous
that
a
good
word
muttered
the
zankiwank
i
wonder
what
it
means
whereupon
he
went
and
asked
robin
goodfellow
and
all
the
other
fairies
but
as
nobody
knew
it
did
not
matter
and
the
poets
arriving
at
that
moment
he
thought
of
a
number
and
sat
on
a
toadstool
maude
recognised
several
of
the
poets
who
came
to
have
their
licences
renewed
she
had
heard
of
poetic
licence
before
but
never
dreamed
that
one
had
to
get
the
unwritten
freedom
from
fairyland
but
so
it
was
several
of
the
poets
seemed
to
be
exorbitant
in
their
demands
and
wanted
to
make
their
poems
all
licence
but
this
titania
would
not
consent
to
so
they
went
away
singing
all
in
tune
too
a
little
piece
that
robin
goodfellow
said
was
a
rondel
life
is
but
a
mingled
song
sung
in
divers
keys
sweet
and
tender
brave
and
strong
as
the
heart
agrees
naught
but
love
each
maid
will
please
when
emotions
throng
life
is
but
a
mingled
song
sung
in
divers
keys
youth
and
age
nor
deem
it
wrong
sing
with
joyous
ease
that
your
days
you
may
prolong
freed
from
care
decrees
life
is
but
a
mingled
song
sung
in
divers
keys
so
on
their
way
they
went
rejoicing
saying
pretty
things
to
the
fairies
the
flowers
and
the
birds
for
they
are
their
best
friends
you
know
and
they
love
all
nature
with
a
vast
and
love
one
singer
as
he
went
along
chanted
to
tell
of
other
joys
the
poet
sings
to
tell
of
love
its
sweets
and
eke
its
pain
the
tenderest
songs
his
magic
fancy
strings
of
love
perchance
that
he
may
never
gain
hearts
may
not
break
and
passion
may
be
weak
but
o
the
grief
of
love
that
dare
never
speak
a
bard
then
took
up
the
cue
and
carolled
these
lines
there
so
much
prose
in
life
that
now
and
then
a
tender
song
of
pity
stirs
the
heart
a
simple
lay
of
love
from
fevered
pen
makes
in
some
soul
the
unshed
start
sing
poets
sing
for
aye
your
sweetest
strain
for
life
without
its
poetry
were
vain
then
they
all
sang
together
a
song
of
may
although
queen
titania
had
declared
that
it
was
midsummer
perhaps
her
midsummer
lasts
all
the
year
round
when
winter
gone
to
rest
and
spring
is
our
dear
guest
the
merry
may
at
break
of
day
comes
in
gay
garlands
drest
the
brightest
smiles
she
brings
of
sweetest
hopes
she
sings
and
trips
with
dainty
grace
and
lightest
fairy
wings
joy
is
the
song
all
nature
sighs
love
is
the
light
in
maidens
eyes
may
is
love
alway
the
budding
branch
and
nodding
tree
join
in
the
revels
and
bow
with
glee
to
greet
the
virgin
may
while
songsters
choose
and
mate
and
woo
their
brides
in
state
the
youth
and
maid
stroll
through
the
glade
the
birds
to
emulate
then
comes
the
queen
of
may
to
hold
her
court
and
sway
while
gallant
blades
salute
the
maids
and
whisper
secrets
gay
love
is
the
song
all
nature
sighs
while
peace
gleams
in
each
maiden
eyes
youth
is
for
joy
alway
the
laughing
rose
and
lily
fair
their
fragrance
shed
upon
the
air
as
though
ever
may
as
the
poets
went
on
their
happy
way
the
last
one
to
depart
turned
to
where
maude
was
standing
and
though
he
could
not
possibly
see
her
said
gently
o
grant
you
little
maiden
your
thoughts
be
aye
sincere
your
dreams
turn
into
actions
your
pleasures
know
no
sear
your
life
be
flowers
and
sunshine
your
days
be
free
from
tear
how
happy
it
made
her
and
what
beautiful
things
these
poets
always
thought
of
and
said
now
peaseblossom
and
mustard
seed
you
may
sing
that
little
song
that
i
made
for
you
when
we
were
floating
up
near
the
moon
and
then
we
shall
soon
have
to
depart
as
we
have
so
many
calls
to
make
this
midsummer
night
illustration
neither
willie
nor
maude
could
understand
how
it
could
be
midsummer
night
because
midsummer
day
was
such
a
long
way
off
quite
six
weeks
for
this
was
only
yet
the
month
of
may
but
they
did
not
say
anything
because
robin
goodfellow
was
looking
at
them
and
they
knew
they
were
invisible
because
they
could
not
even
feel
themselves
which
is
a
curious
sensation
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
now
this
is
the
song
that
peaseblossom
and
mustard
seed
sang
together
in
unison
the
fairies
led
by
robin
good
fellow
joining
in
the
chorus
will
you
walk
into
the
garden
will
you
walk
into
the
garden
said
the
poppy
to
the
rose
your
tender
heart
do
harden
do
not
elevate
your
nose
for
the
has
sent
us
all
because
of
your
perfume
and
the
box
a
case
has
lent
us
to
make
a
little
room
so
rosey
rosey
sweet
little
posy
come
to
our
garden
fÃªte
and
our
little
will
lend
you
their
coaches
so
that
you
may
be
late
all
the
waterblinks
are
waiting
just
beneath
the
dogwood
shade
while
the
teazle
loudly
prating
to
the
madder
little
maid
the
old
cranberry
grows
tartish
all
about
a
goosefoot
corn
but
the
primrose
dressed
quite
smartish
will
explain
it
but
a
thorn
so
rosey
rosey
sweet
little
posy
come
to
our
garden
fÃªte
our
naughty
young
nettles
shall
be
on
their
fettles
all
stinging
things
to
bate
now
for
tea
there
perrywinkles
and
some
butterwort
and
sedge
and
with
some
sundew
from
the
hedge
there
is
sorrel
balsam
mallow
some
milk
wort
and
mare
tail
too
with
some
borage
and
some
sallow
figworts
and
violets
blue
so
rosey
rosey
sweet
little
posy
come
to
our
garden
fÃªte
and
the
iris
and
crocus
shall
sing
us
and
joke
us
some
humorous
things
sedate
that
all
very
well
exclaimed
the
zankiwank
roses
are
always
delightful
especially
the
cabbage
roses
because
you
can
eat
them
for
breakfast
but
every
rose
has
its
drawback
ho
and
it
thorn
he
added
dancing
with
pain
for
at
that
moment
several
rose
bushes
he
was
passing
by
gave
him
a
good
pricking
ah
said
queen
titania
that
is
not
the
way
to
look
at
the
beautiful
things
of
life
it
is
because
the
thorns
have
roses
that
we
should
be
thankful
and
not
find
fault
because
the
roses
have
thorns
that
is
a
sentiment
that
i
can
endorse
it
is
a
true
bill
and
almost
as
good
as
one
of
my
own
replied
robin
goodfellow
saucily
and
now
let
us
wander
through
the
florange
grove
and
gather
some
moranges
and
lemons
illustration
neither
maude
nor
willie
had
heard
of
floranges
or
moranges
and
wondered
what
sort
of
fruit
they
could
be
when
their
attention
was
drawn
once
more
to
queen
titania
and
her
court
of
fairies
who
were
all
seated
beneath
the
greenwood
tree
eating
puddings
and
pies
that
mustard
seed
and
peaseblossom
and
cobweb
were
making
for
them
chanting
as
they
cooked
the
pastry
by
the
fire
of
their
own
eloquence
this
doggerel
first
you
take
a
little
orange
and
you
squeeze
out
all
the
pips
then
you
add
a
crimson
florange
which
you
cut
up
into
chips
then
you
stir
them
in
a
porringe
with
your
tiny
finger
tips
and
you
have
the
finest
morange
ever
known
to
mortal
lips
how
willie
and
maude
longed
to
taste
a
morange
the
zankiwank
evidently
enjoyed
the
one
he
had
for
he
said
it
tasted
just
like
mango
ice
cream
blackberries
and
plum
tart
all
mixed
up
together
so
that
it
must
have
been
nice
after
the
feast
titania
said
she
must
be
going
as
she
felt
certain
that
there
were
some
invisible
mortals
present
she
could
hear
them
breathing
at
this
robin
goodfellow
grew
nervous
and
the
children
got
frightened
lest
the
queen
should
discover
and
punish
them
for
their
temerity
where
christmas
pudding
bliss
is
folly
to
eat
pies
cried
robin
goodfellow
to
divert
attention
and
the
fairies
at
the
same
time
but
the
queen
was
not
satisfied
and
ordered
a
special
dress
train
to
carry
them
away
again
illustration
at
this
moment
the
two
children
tumbled
off
nothing
into
a
vacant
space
making
the
zankiwank
scream
out
it
must
be
the
bletherwitch
in
the
clutches
of
the
nargalnannacus
but
it
was
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
robin
goodfellow
presence
of
mind
i
am
sure
i
do
not
know
what
would
have
happened
that
lively
rascal
however
guessing
that
he
had
used
the
wrong
seeds
at
once
stepped
forward
and
taking
maude
and
willie
each
by
the
hand
boldly
presented
them
to
her
majesty
as
being
favoured
mortals
who
were
friends
of
the
zankiwank
and
so
the
queen
received
them
and
asked
them
more
questions
than
you
could
find
in
any
school
book
none
of
which
they
answered
because
when
they
turned
round
the
queen
and
all
her
court
had
vanished
and
only
the
zankiwank
was
to
be
seen
the
zankiwank
took
no
notice
of
them
whatever
and
behaved
just
as
though
he
could
not
see
them
they
called
him
by
name
without
arousing
his
attention
for
he
was
once
more
writing
a
telegram
only
he
did
not
know
where
to
send
it
in
the
distance
maude
could
hear
the
sound
of
voices
and
she
declared
she
could
recognise
the
queen
singing
though
willie
said
it
must
have
been
her
imagination
because
he
could
not
however
this
is
what
maude
said
she
heard
dear
little
maid
may
joy
be
thine
as
through
your
life
you
go
let
truth
and
peace
each
act
design
that
hope
turn
not
to
woe
dream
if
you
will
in
maiden
prime
but
let
each
dream
be
true
for
idle
hopes
waste
golden
time
that
wo
return
to
you
in
after
years
when
ways
divide
and
love
dispels
each
tear
know
in
some
breast
there
will
abide
a
thought
for
you
sincere
so
strive
dear
maid
to
play
your
part
with
noble
aim
and
deed
let
sweetness
ever
sway
your
heart
and
so
i
give
you
speed
illustration
while
maudie
was
pondering
over
the
meaning
of
these
words
she
was
suddenly
lifted
off
her
feet
and
when
she
recovered
from
the
shock
found
herself
with
willie
in
a
balloon
while
down
below
the
zankiwank
was
fondly
embracing
the
jackarandajam
who
had
just
arrived
with
a
whole
army
of
people
including
tom
thumb
blue
beard
and
all
his
wives
with
sister
anne
dick
whittington
and
his
black
cat
and
tom
tiddler
and
about
three
thousand
four
hundred
and
five
goblins
and
sprites
who
all
commenced
running
a
race
up
and
down
the
valley
from
which
they
were
fast
speeding
keep
the
pot
keep
the
pot
bawled
the
zankiwank
and
away
they
all
went
again
helter
skelter
in
and
out
and
up
and
down
like
skaters
on
a
rink
gradually
the
balloon
altered
its
course
and
instead
of
going
up
it
went
straight
ahead
to
a
large
inpenetrable
wall
that
seemed
to
threaten
them
with
destruction
while
to
the
annoyance
of
both
maude
and
willie
they
could
hear
the
revellers
down
below
dancing
and
singing
as
though
they
were
in
no
jeopardy
and
if
the
words
had
been
correct
they
would
have
declared
that
it
was
the
mariners
of
england
who
were
singing
their
own
song
you
sleepy
little
mortals
high
up
in
a
balloon
you
soon
will
pass
the
portals
beyond
the
crescent
moon
then
shadowland
will
come
in
view
a
dream
within
a
dream
so
keep
in
your
sleep
while
we
keep
up
the
steam
while
the
midnight
hours
are
all
and
we
are
all
the
spirits
of
the
fairies
this
eve
are
very
bright
for
in
your
nest
the
mare
is
who
only
rides
by
night
into
a
magic
sphere
you
go
a
dream
within
a
dream
so
keep
in
your
sleep
while
we
keep
up
the
steam
for
shadow
land
is
deep
and
steep
and
we
are
all
with
a
bump
and
a
thump
and
a
jump
the
balloon
burst
against
the
wall
and
maude
and
willie
felt
themselves
dropping
dropping
dropping
until
the
zankiwank
bounced
up
and
caught
them
both
in
his
arms
saying
as
he
rushed
forward
illustration
quick
the
gates
are
only
open
for
five
seconds
once
a
week
and
if
we
do
get
inside
at
once
we
shall
be
jammed
in
the
so
into
shadow
land
they
tumbled
as
the
porter
mumbled
and
grumbled

shut
the
gate
with
a
boom
and
a
bang

part
iii
a
visit
to
shadow
land
as
a
shadow
short
as
any
dream
bright
as
the
lightning
in
the
collied
night
that
in
a
spleen
unfolds
both
heaven
and
earth
and
ere
a
man
hath
power
to
say
behold
the
jaws
of
darkness
do
devour
it
up
so
quick
bright
things
come
to
shakespeare
a
crushing
and
a
crashing
there
a
flaring
and
a
flashing
there
a
rushing
and
a
dashing
as
if
crowds
were
hurrying
by
there
a
screaming
and
a
shouting
as
a
multitude
was
routing
and
phantom
forms
were
flouting
the
blackness
of
the
sky
and
in
mockery
their
voices
are
lifted
wild
and
high
as
they
lilt
a
merry
measure
while
they
forrest
a
visit
to
shadow
land
this
cheerily
explained
the
zankiwank
is
shadow
land
where
everything
is
mist
though
nothing
is
ever
found
because
nothing
is
ever
lost
for
you
can
not
lose
nothing
unless
you
have
nothing
to
gain
consequently
i
shall
leave
you
to
find
out
everything
else
with
which
nonsensical
introduction
the
zankiwank
caught
hold
of
the
wings
of
a
house
sprang
on
to
the
gables
and
flew
down
the
nearest
chimney
followed
by
all
the
dancers
they
had
seen
below
including
the
jackarandajam
and
all
the
residents
from
land
of
whom
you
can
think
but
if
you
can
not
think
of
all
of
them
yourself
ask
your
sisters
to
think
for
you
it
certainly
was
a
land
of
shadows
where
revolving
lights
like
flashes
from
a
lighthouse
sent
all
sorts
of
varying
rays
right
through
the
mists
presenting
to
them
a
fresh
panorama
of
views
every
other
minute
or
so
the
shadows
danced
all
through
the
place
which
seemed
like
a
large
plateau
or
near
a
magnificent
stretch
of
ocean
which
they
could
see
before
them
with
ships
passing
to
and
fro
incessantly
and
all
the
time
goblins
hob
nob
and
otherwise
red
blue
and
green
kept
rushing
backwards
and
forwards
sometimes
with
a
whole
school
of
children
following
madly
in
their
wake
such
a
dashing
and
a
crashing
was
never
seen
or
heard
before
and
as
each
creature
carried
his
shadow
with
him
you
can
just
imagine
what
a
lot
of
lights
and
shades
there
must
have
been
occasionally
there
would
be
a
slight
lull
in
the
excitement
and
the
racing
and
the
rushing
would
cease
for
awhile
each
time
that
there
was
a
pause
in
the
seemingly
endless
races
a
quaint
little
person
dressed
in
short
petticoats
sky
blue
stockings
and
a
crimson
peaked
hat
stepped
from
nowhere
in
particular
and
either
sang
a
song
herself
or
introduced
a
small
girl
spirit
or
boy
spirit
who
did
so
for
her
illustration
the
first
time
she
descended
on
to
the
plateau
on
a
broom
and
introduced
herself
by
throwing
a
light
from
the
magic
lantern
which
she
carried
on
to
a
sheet
of
water
which
she
unfolded
and
thereon
appeared
this
announcement
i
am
the
great
little
winny
weg
but
as
neither
willie
nor
maude
knew
what
a
winny
weg
was
they
were
necessarily
compelled
to
await
further
developments
however
as
none
came
they
listened
carefully
to
her
song
which
as
far
as
i
can
remember
was
like
this
the
funny
little
man
i
am
going
to
tell
a
story
of
a
little
girl
i
knew
she
had
a
little
sweetheart
no
bigger
than
my
shoe
she
used
to
sit
and
sew
all
day
he
used
to
run
and
play
and
when
she
tried
to
chide
him
this
is
all
that
he
would
say
o
my
here
such
a
jolly
spree
sally

coming
with
jack
sheppard
into
tea
she
bringing
baby
bunting
with
old

and
little
jacky
horner
with
the
roly
poly
frog
o
my
it
fills
my
heart
with
glee
the
house
that
jack
is
building
is
big
enough
for
me
in
time
these
two
got
married
and
they
took
a
little
house
and
soon
a
tiny
baby
came
no
bigger
than
a
mouse
but
still
the
little
husband
played
at
skipping
rope
and
top
with
all
the
little
girls
and
boys
and
drank
their
o
my
this
funny
little
sam
thought
the
world
was
bread
and
cheese
and
all
the
trees
were
jam
he
stood
his
baby
on
its
head
and
played
at
shuttlecock
and
then
he
rocked
himself
to
sleep
with
cakes
of
o
my
he
was
a
sniggadee
he
went
to
bed
at
one
and
rose
at
three
now
once
they
gave
a
party
and
sweet
cinderella
came
with
blue
beard
and
red
riding
hood
and
little
and
nelly
bly
who
winked
her
eye
and
greedy
tommy
stout
and
tam
and
likewise
colin

o
my
it
was
a
jolly
spree
one
from
fairy
land
and
fiddle
faddle
fee
and
mary
brought
her
little
lamb
from
which
they
all
had
chops
while
puck
and
cupid
served
them
with
some
hot
boiled
acid
drops
o
my
it
was
a
happy
spread
they
all
sat
down
on
toadstools
and
in
mushrooms
went
to
bed
as
time
went
on
and
he
grew
grey
he
took
to
flying
kites
and
then
he
took
to
staying
out
so
very
late
o
nights
one
day
he

he
was

flew
up
in

and
if
you

you
will
hear
singing

going

away
up
in

and
then

illustration
the
two
children
were
so
absorbed
in
listening
to
this
rhyming
rigmarole
that
they
did
not
observe
the
winny
weg
depart
though
when
they
came
to
think
of
it
the
last
verse
was
sung
in
the
clouds
and
presumably
by
the
funny
little
man
himself
and
they
quite
longed
for
him
to
pay
them
a
call
but
he
did
so
the
goblins
started
off
once
more
on
their
wild
career
this
time
on
horseback
making
such
a
hammering
and
a
clattering
as
almost
to
deafen
them
illustration
quickly
in
the
rear
of
the
white
horses
and
the
spirits
who
all
wore
little
round
caps
with
tassels
at
the
top
came
a
procession
of
dolls
wax
dolls
wooden
dolls
and
dolls
very
finely
dressed
with
here
and
there
a
doll
who
had
lost
a
leg
or
an
arm
or
a
head
while
some
were
quite
cripples
and
had
to
be
carried
by
a
train
of
tiny
girls
in
very
short
frocks
and
very
long
sashes
at
the
head
of
these
appeared
the
winny
weg
again
and
just
as
they
were
vanishing
in
the
shadows
a
regular
shower
of
broken
dolls
came
down
in
dreadful
disorder
causing
the
children
to
break
from
their
ranks
to
gather
up
their
property
as
the
dolls
it
was
evident
were
their
own
old
companions
which
they
had
discarded
when
new
ones
were
given
to
them
one
particularly
disreputable
doll
with
a
broken
nose
and
a
very
battered
body
was
claimed
by
the
prettiest
child
of
all
and
as
she
picked
it
up
she
stepped
into
the
centre
of
a
ring
formed
by
her
and
recited
to
them
this
pathetic
poem

unfortunate

afternoon
illustration
after
this
affecting
recital
they
all
took
out
their
hankelwiches
as
the
owner
of
the
unfortunate
doll
said
and
placing
themselves
in
line
they
followed
as
mourners
the
remains
of
the
deceased
doll
to
the
end
of
a
back
garden
which
some
of
the
goblins
had
brought
in
with
them
then
everything
faded
away
again
and
more
shadows
danced
on
the
land
and
the
sea
until
nothing
was
to
be
seen
but
the
galloping
sprites
and
the
winny
weg
who
was
dancing
in
a
corner
all
by
herself
illustration

a
pink
light
now
burst
through
the
haze
the
goblins
rode
off
and
a
perfect
nursery
was
unfolded
before
maude
and
willie
who
were
reclining
peacefully
on
a
golden
couch
with
silver
cushions
they
had
no
desire
to
talk
but
were
content
to
drink
in
all
that
they
saw
rapturously
and
silently
the
nursery
was
crowded
wee
were
crawling
about
everywhere
with
a
dozen
coy
dots
with
bows
and
arrows
and
right
away
at
the
back
a
beautiful
garden
was
disclosed
in
which
happy
young
couples
were
seen
perambulating
talking
soft
nothings
to
each
other
meanwhile
the
crawling
babies
in
the
universal
nursery
began
to
stand
up
and
then
commenced
such
a
game
of
by
these
tiny
mites
that
made
even
the
cheshire
cat
smile
it
was
so
funny
to
hear
these
dots
call
out
to
each
other
to
tuck
in
their
tuppennies
and
to
see
them
flying
without
stopping
to
take
breath
over
each
other
backs
even
the
little
pink
and
blue
cupids
laughed
until
the
babies
crept
back
to
their
cribs
once
more
and
were
rocked
off
to
sleep
as
the
winny
weg
waved
her
wand
and
an
unseen
choir
of
little
girls
and
boys
was
heard
singing
this
lullaby
o
we
are
so
sleepy
o
we
are
so
sleepy
blinky
winky

why
are
you
so
peepy

when
the

dies
the
slight
mist
that
had
descended
went
up
just
like
a
gauze
curtain
bringing
into
view
again
the
lovely
garden
reposing
in
the
rear
in
a
beautiful
green
bath
of
light
then
the
merry
winny
weg
caught
hold
of
the
cupids
and
incited
them
to
dance
a
slow
gavotte
and
as
they
danced
they
warbled
lusciously

rare
violets

and

and
budding
roses
red
with
of
hue
their
fragrance
gently
spread
other
voices
which
seemed
to
belong
to
the
lads
and
lasses
in
the
garden
joined
in
the
chorus

with

the
land
of

and
the
land
of
hope
and
joy
and
peace
the
two
children
wandered
off
as
it
were
into
a
dream
for
a
time
and
when
they
gazed
again
the
garden
was
more
delightful
than
ever
a
joyous
blend
of
spring
and
summer
seemed
to
invade
the
grounds
while
many
of
the
flowers
and
trees
showed
slight
signs
of
autumn
tinting
in
one
corner
of
the
garden
a
magnificent
marble
and
bronze
fountain
unexpectedly
sprang
up
through
the
ground
and
played
unceasingly
to
the
ethereal
skies
merry
children
danced
and
played
around
its
base
and
lovers
young
and
old
promenaded
affectionately
up
and
down
the
innumerable
groves
stopping
now
and
then
to
offer
each
other
a
draught
of
the
sparkling
water
that
fell
so
deliciously
into
the
amber
cups
there
were
no
shadows
now
all
was
bright
and
glorious
sunlight
and
pleasure
reigned
supreme
from
the
clouds
unseen
singers
sang
softly
to
the
people
as
they
passed
and
repassed
and
this
was
the
story
of
their
song
in
a
garden
stood
a
fountain
sparkling
in
the
sun
rising
like
a
crystal
mountain
never
ceasing
never
done

the

faded
and
died
away
the
scene
changed
and
a
purple
curtain
descended
hiding
everything
and
everybody
except
the
winny
weg
an
extraordinary
commotion
outside
warned
the
children
that
a
fresh
flight
of
goblins
might
be
expected
and
sure
enough
in
stalked
an
army
of
giants
from
one
side
who
were
met
by
an
army
of
dwarfs
from
the
other
the
latter
on
stilts
but
the
curious
thing
about
them
was
that
the
giants
had
only
got
one
eye
which
was
stuck
on
the
ends
of
their
noses
while
the
dwarfs
had
their
eyes
where
their
ears
ought
to
be
and
their
ears
in
the
place
usually
reserved
for
the
eyes
besides
which
they
each
had
a
large
horn
fixed
in
the
middle
of
their
foreheads
both
armies
expressed
surprise
at
seeing
each
other
the
leaders
of
which
said
quite
calmly
as
though
they
were
asking
one
another
to
have
a
penny
bun
cut
up
in
four
between
them
both
said
quite
calmly
i
suppose
we
must
fight
now
we
have
met
upon
hearing
this
the
winny
weg
mounted
her
and
flew
up
out
of
harm
way
and
then
commenced
the
most
terrible
battle
ever
seen
on
land
or
sea
they
fought
with
penknives
and
the
battle
lasted
half
an
hour
and
only
one
stilt
was
injured
so
they
began
again
using
coal
scuttles
and
tongs
and
the
din
was
so
fearful
and
the
giants
and
the
dwarfs
got
so
mixed
up
that
a
railway
train
filled
with
shadows
of
the
past
rushed
on
and
sent
both
armies
flying
then
the
shadows
deepened
and
deepened
and
the
lightning
flashed
the
thunders
crashed
the
sea
roared
and
a
great
red
cavern
opened
and
swallowed
up
everything
including
maude
and
willie
who
certainly
were
not
quite
awake
to
what
was
going
forward
and
all
they
could
recollect
of
the
occurrence
was
that
they
saw
the
winkles
and
the
shrimps
on
the

again
without

the
long
wide
thoroughfare
in
which
the
children
now
found
themselves
was
just
like
one
of
the
main
shopping
streets
in
london
some
parts
reminded
them
of
regent
street
some
of
the
strand
and
some

and
there
was
the

only
somehow
a

it
was
odd
toy

shops
and
shops
of

sizes
greeted
them
on

moreover
there
were
the
shopkeepers
and
their
assistants
and
crowds
of
people
hurrying
by
jostling
the
loungers
and
the
gazers
and
the
one
policeman
who
was
talking
to
a
fat
person
in
a
print
gown
who
was
standing
at
the
area
steps
of
the
only
private
house
they
could

they
were
wondering
what
they

the
policeman
cried

come
along
there
now
then
move
on
how
rude
of
him
however
they
moved
on
and
were
nearly
knocked
down
by
the
zankiwank
who
darted
into
the
to
receive
a
telegram
and
to
send
one

they
followed

they

maude
scarcely
believed
that
the
bletherwitch
could
possess
so
many
charms
or
she
would
not
keep
her
future
husband
waiting
so
long
for
her
but
she
knew
it
was
useless
offering
any
advice
on
so
delicate
a
subject
so
she
and
willie
begged
the
zankiwank
to
be
their
guide
and
to
show
them
the
lions
of
topsy
turvey
which
he
readily
agreed
to
do
and
now
as
they
left
the
they
turned
their
attention
to
the
shops
and
were
surprised
to
read
the
names
over
the
windows
of
several
individuals
they
had
already
met
in
the
train
for
instance
the
wimble
lived
next
door
to
the
wamble
and
each
one
had
printed
in
the
window
a
very
curious
legend
this
is
what
the
wamble
had
good
resolutions
bought
sold
and
exchanged
a
few
bad
and
some
slightly
damaged
to
be
disposed

a
bargain

with
the
business

while
the
wimble
stated
the
nature
of
his
wares
as
follows

resolutions

exchanged

few
good
and
some

indifferent

no

you

us
that
they

you

only
in
business
of
course
they
are
desperately
opposed
to
each
other
that
is
why
they
are
so
prosperous
explained
the
zankiwank
are
they
prosperous
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
as
buying
and
selling
resolutions
how
can
one
buy
a
good
resolution
enquired
maude
or
exchange
bad
resolutions
said
willie
it
is
quite
wicked
not
at
all
not
at
all
so
many
people
make
good
resolutions
and
never
carry
them
out
therefore
if
there
were
no
place
where
you
could
dispose
of
them
they
would
be
wasted
but
bad
resolutions
nobody
makes
bad
resolutions
at
least
they
ought
not
to
and
i
do
believe
it
is
true
pardon
me
interrupted
the
zankiwank
if
you
make
a
good
resolution
and
do
carry
it
out
does
it
become
a
bad
resolution
answer
me
that
this
however
was
an
aspect
of
the
question
that
had
never
occurred
to
them
and
they
were
unable
to
reply
it
seems
to
me
to
be
nonsense
and
worse
than
nonsense
for
one
brother
to
deal
in
bad
resolutions
and
the
other
in
good
resolutions
why
do
not
they
become
a
firm
and
mix
the
two
together
responded
maude
you
horrify
me
mix
the
good
and
the
bad
together
that
would
never
do
the
best
resolutions
in
the
world
would
be
contaminated
if
they
were
all
warehoused
under
one
roof
besides
the
wimble
is
himself
full
of
good
resolutions
so
that
he
can
mingle
with
the
bad
without
suffering
any
evil
while
the
wamble
is
differently
constituted
the
children
did
not
understand
the
zankiwank
argument
a
bit
it
all
seemed
so
ridiculous
a
sudden
thought
occurred
to
willie
who
then
collects
the
resolutions
oh
a
person
of
no
resolution
whatever
he
commenced
life
with
only
one
resolution
and
he
lost
it
or
it
got
mislaid
or
he
never
made
use
of
it
or
something
equally
unfortunate
and
so
he
was
christened
want
of
resolution
and
he
does
the
collecting
work
very
well
considering
all
things
no
doubt
the
zankiwank
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
but
as
the
children
did
not
what
did
it
signify
therefore
they
asked
no
more
questions
but
went
along
the
street
marvelling
at
all
they
saw
the
next
shop
at
which
they
stopped
was
kept
by
jorumgander
the
younger
dealer
in
magic
and
mystery
jorumgander
the
younger
is
not
of
much
use
now
said
the
zankiwank
sorrowfully
he
chiefly
aims
at
making
a
mystery
of
everything
but
so
many
people
not
engaged
in
trade
make
a
mystery
of
nothing
every
day
that
he
is
sadly
handicapped
and
most
sensible
people
hate
a
mystery
of
any
kind
unless
it
belongs
to
themselves
so
that
he
finds
customers
very
shy
once
upon
a
time
he
would
get
hold
of
a
simple
story
and
turn
it
into
such
a
gigantic
mystery
that
all
the
world
would
be
mystified
but
those
happy
days
are
gone
and
he
thinks
of
turning
his
business
into
a
company
to
sell
original
ideas
when
he
knows
where
to
find
them
i
do
see
what
good
can
come
of
making
a
mystery
of
anything
especially
if
anything
is
true
sagaciously
remarked
maude
but
is
not
true
nor
is
untrue
there
is
the
difficulty
if
anything
were
true
nothing
would
be
untrue
and
then
where
should
we
be
nowhere
said
willie
without
thinking
exactly
that
is
just
where
we
are
now
and
a
very
nice
place
it
is
there
is
one
thing
however
that
jorumgander
the
younger
there
he
is
with
the
pink
and
green
nose
do
say
anything
about
his
personal
appearance
what
i
was
going
to
say
he
will
say
instead
it
is
a
habit
we
have
occasionally
he
is
my
grandfather
you
know
your
grandfather
what
that
young
man
why
he
is
not
more
than
and
three
quarters
i
sure
replied
maude
you
are
right
he
and
three
quarters
you
do
quite
understand
our
relationships
the
boy
as
you
have
no
doubt
heard
is
father
to
the
man
very
well
i
am
the
man
when
he
was
a
boy
on
my
aunt
side
he
was
father
to
me
that
plain
enough
he
has
grown
older
since
then
though
he
is
little
more
than
a
boy
in
discretion
still
therefore
he
is
my
grandfather
how
very
absurdly
you
do
talk
mr
zankiwank
laughed
willie
but
here
is
your
grandfather
and
at
that
moment
jorumgander
the
younger
left
his
shop
and
approached
them
with
a
case
of
pens
which
he
offered
for
sale
try
my
magic
pens
they
are
the
best
in
the
market
because
there
are
no
others
there
is
no
demand
for
them
and
few
folk
will
have
them
for
a
gift
therefore
i
can
highly
recommend
them
illustration
how
can
you
recommend
your
pens
when
you
declare
that
nobody
will
buy
them
demanded
willie
because
they
are
a
novelty
they
are
magic
pens
you
know
and
of
course
as
nobody
possesses
any
they
must
be
rare
that
is
logic
i
think
buy
one
said
the
zankiwank
he
has
not
had
any
supper
yet
in
what
way
are
they
magic
pens
enquired
maude
ah
i
thought
i
should
find
a
customer
between
michaelmas
and
may
day
cried
jorumgander
the
younger
quite
cheerfully
the
beauty
of
these
pens
is
that
they
never
tell
a
story
but
suppose
you
want
to
write
a
story
that
is
a
different
thing
if
you
have
the
ability
to
write
a
story
you
wo
want
a
magic
pen
these
pens
are
only
for
use
for
example
if
you
want
to
write
to
your
charwoman
to
tell
her
you
have
got
the
toothache
and
you
have
got
the
toothache
the
magic
pen
refuses
to
lend
itself
to
telling
a
a
crammer
suggested
willie
crammer
thank
you
i
do
know
what
it
means
but
crammer
is
the
correct
word
the
magic
pen
will
simplify
the
truth
whether
you
wish
to
tell
it
or
not
i
do
not
understand
whispered
maude
let
me
try
to
explain
said
jorumgander
the
younger
politely
the
magic
pen
will
only
write
exactly
what
you
think
what
is
in
your
mind
what
you
ought
to
say
whether
you
wish
to
or
not
a
very
useful
article
i
am
sure
said
the
zankiwank
i
gave
six
dozen
away
last
christmas
but
nobody
used
them
after
a
few
days
and
i
ca
think
why
ah
sighed
jorumgander
the
younger
and
i
have
had
all
my
stock
returned
on
my
hands
the
first
day
i
opened
my
shop
i
sold
more
than
i
can
remember
and
the
next
morning
all
the
purchasers
came
and
wanted
their
money
back
they
said
if
they
wanted
to
tell
the
truth
they
knew
how
to
do
it
and
did
not
want
to
be
taught
by
an
nib
but
i
am
afraid
they
were
not
speaking
the
truth
then
at
any
rate
here
let
me
make
you
a
present
of
one
and
you
can
write
and
tell
me
all
about
yourselves
when
you
go
home
meanwhile
as
the
streets
are
crowded
and
our
policeman
is
not
looking
let
us
sing
a
quiet
song
to
celebrate
the
event
we
sing
of
the
magic
pen
that
never
tells
a
story
that
in
the
hands
of
men
would
lead
them
on
to
glory
for
what
you
ought
to
do
and
you
should
all
be
saying
in
fact
of
all
things
true
this
pen
will
be
bewraying
so
let
us
sing
a
roundelay
pop
goes
the
weazel
treacle
four
pence
a
pound
which
we
think
should
please
all
what
the
chorus
had
to
do
with
the
song
nobody
knew
but
they
all
sang
it
everybody
in
the
street
and
all
the
customers
in
the
shops
as
well
and
even
the
policeman
sang
the
last
line
you
take
it
in
your
hand
and
set
yourself
no
matter
what
you
planned
the
truth
be
inditing
and
thus
you
can
not
fail
to
speak
your
mind
correctly
and
honestly
you
sail
but
never
indirectly
so
let
us
sing
a
roundelay
pop
goes
the
weazel
treacle
four
pence
a
pound
which
we
think
will
please
all
again
everybody
danced
and
sang
till
the
policeman
told
them
to
move
on
when
jorumgander
the
younger
put
up
his
shutters
and
went
away
a
most
original
man
exclaimed
the
zankiwank
he
ought
to
have
been
a
postman
a
postman
why
because
he
was
always
such
a
capital
boy
with
his
letters
he
knew
his
alphabet
long
before
he
could
spell
and
now
he
knows
every
letter
you
can
think
of
i
do
see
anything
very
original
in
that
said
willie
there
are
only
letters
in
the
english
language
that
he
can
know
only
letters
dear
me
why
millions
of
people
are
writing
fresh
letters
every
day
and
he
knows
them
all
directly
he
sees
them
i
hope
you
will
go
to
school
some
day
and
learn
differently
from
that
only
letters
repeated
the
zankiwank
in
wonderment
only
letters
then
he
cried
suddenly
how
convenient
it
would
be
if
everybody
was
his
own
dictionary
illustration
that
is
impossible
one
can
not
be
a
book
oh
yes
nothing
simpler
let
everybody
choose
his
own
words
and
give
his
own
meaning
to
them
what
use
would
that
be
asked
willie
none
whatever
because
if
you
always
had
your
own
meaning
you
would
not
want
anybody
else
to
be
meaning
anything
what
a
lot
of
trouble
that
would
save
i
ask
the
jackarandajam
to
make
one
for
me
why
here
he
is
the
children
recognised
the
jackarandajam
immediately
and
shook
hands
with
him
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
all
i
have
just
been
suffering
from
a
most
severe
attack
of
inspiration
how
very
inexplicable
i
beg
your
pardon
moaned
the
zankiwank
it
is
a
little
difficult
but
it
is
i
believe
a
strictly
proper
word
though
i
do
not
pretend
to
know
its
meaning
the
jackarandajam
accepted
the
apology
by
gracefully
bowing
though
neither
felt
quite
at
ease
what
is
the
use
of
saying
things
you
do
mean
asked
maude
none
at
all
that
is
the
best
of
it
because
we
are
always
doing
something
without
any
reason
to
attempt
to
argue
with
the
zankiwank
maude
knew
was
futile
so
she
merely
enquired
how
the
jackarandajam
felt
after
his
attack
of
inspiration
and
what
he
took
for
it
nothing
was
the
simple
rejoinder
it
comes
and
it
goes
and
there
you
are
at
least
most
of
the
time
what
is
inspiration
said
willie
the
zankiwank
and
the
jackarandajam
both
shook
their
heads
in
a
solemn
manner
and
looked
as
wise
as
the
sphinx
then
the
former
answered
slowly
and
deliberately
inspiration
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
comes
when
you
do
not
fish
for
it
but
said
willie
who
did
not
quite
see
the
force
of
the
explanation
you
ca
fish
for
a
great
many
things
and
of
course
nothing
comes
how
do
you
manage
then
this
was
a
decided
poser
beating
them
at
their
own
game
so
the
zankiwank
sent
another
telegram
presumably
to
the
bletherwitch
and
the
jackarandajam
made
a
fresh
cigarette
which
he
carefully
refrained
from
smoking
then
he
turned
to
the
two
children
and
said
mournfully
have
you
seen
my
new
invention
ah
it
was
the
result
of
my
recent
attack
of
inspiration
come
with
me
and
i
will
show
you
thereupon
he
led
the
way
to
a
large
square
with
a
nice
garden
in
the
centre
where
all
the
houses
had
bills
outside
to
inform
the
passers
by
that
these
desirable
revolving
residences
were
to
be
let
or
sold
all
my
property
i
had
the
houses
built
myself
from
my
own
plans
come
inside
the
first
so
they
followed
the
jackarandajam
and
entered
the
first
house
the
great
advantage
of
these
houses
he
declared
is
that
you
can
turn
them
round
to
meet
the
sun
at
will
they
are
constructed
on
a
new
principle
being
fixed
on
a
pivot
you
see
i
turn
this
handle
by
the
hall
door
and
hey
presto
we
are
looking
into
the
back
garden
while
the
kitchen
is
round
at
the
front
and
such
was
the
fact
the
house
would
move
any
way
one
wished
simply
by
turning
the
electric
handle
it
is
so
convenient
you
see
if
you
do
want
to
be
at
home
to
any
visitor
when
you
see
anyone
coming
up
the
garden
path
you
move
the
crank
and
away
you
go
and
your
visitor
to
his
consternation
finds
himself
gazing
in
at
the
kitchen
window
and
then
he
naturally
departs
with
many
misgivings
as
to
the
state
of
his
health
especially
if
the
cook
is
taken
by
surprise
you
should
never
take
a
cook
by
surprise
it
always
spoils
her
photograph
oh
dear
oh
dear
cried
maude
why
will
you
say
such
contradictory
things
i
do
see
the
sense
of
having
such
a
house
at
all
it
would
upset
things
so
besides
chimed
in
willie
you
would
never
have
any
aspect
or
prospect
are
they
both
good
to
eat
said
the
jackarandajam
eagerly
of
course
not
i
meant
that
your
house
would
first
be
facing
the
east
and
then
south
and
then
west
and
then
north
and
what
would
be
the
use
of
that
no
use
whatever
that
why
we
do
it
oh
but
do
not
laugh
we
are
not
quite
devoid
of
reason
because
we
are
all
mad
are
you
really
mad
yes
was
the
gay
response
we
do
mind
it
a
bit
we
are
all
as
crooked
as
a
teetotaler
corkscrew
i
am
glad
you
do
not
like
the
revolving
houses
because
i
am
going
to
sell
them
to
the
clerk
of
the
weather
and
his
eight
new
assistants
i
did
not
know
the
clerk
of
the
weather
required
any
assistance
exclaimed
willie
though
personally
he
did
not
know
the
clerk
of
the
weather
oh
yes
he
must
have
assistants
he
does
things
so
badly
and
with
eight
more
he
will
if
he
is
careful
do
them
worse
here
was
another
one
of
those
contradictions
that
the
children
could
not
understand
i
hope
you
ca
because
i
do
myself
generally
the
jackarandajam
went
on
reflectively
it
is
bound
to
happen
the
clerk
of
the
weather
has
only
one
assistant
now
and
it
takes
the
two
of
them
to
do
a
prog
prog
interrupt
me
a
prog
prognostication
phew
what
a
beautiful
word
prognostication
ten
minutes
now
therefore
it
stands
to
reason
as
the
sun
dial
remarked
that
nine
could
do
it
in
much
less
time
you
will
excuse
me
halloed
the
zankiwank
down
the
next
door
chimney
i
beg
to
differ
from
you
that
is
to
say
on
the
contrary
for
instance
if
it
takes
two
people
ten
minutes
to
do
a
prog
you
must
fill
in
the
rest
yourself
prog
of
course
as
there
are
so
many
more
to
do
the
same
thing
it
must
take
them
minutes
what
a
brain
exclaimed
the
jackarandajam
ecstatically
he
ought
to
have
been
born
a
calculating
machine
he
beats
euclid
and
that
fellow
named
smith
on
all
points
i
never
thought
of
it
in
the
light
of
multiplying
the
addition
illustration
more
nonsense
observed
willie
to
maude
what
does
it
all
mean
they
looked
out
of
window
and
saw
the
zankiwank
arguing
with
the
clerk
of
the
weather
and
the
weather
cock
on
top
of
the
vane
of
a
large
building
outside
every
minute
they
expected
to
see
them
tumble
down
but
they
did
not
so
to
cheer
them
up
the
jackarandajam
stood
on
his
head
and
sang
them
this
comic
song
the
clerk
of
the
weather
the
clerk
of
the
weather
went
out
to
walk
all
down
victoria
street
of
late
his
ways
had
caused
much
talk
and
chatter
indiscreet
so
he
donned
a
suit
of
mingled
sleet
with
a
dash
of
falling
snow
a
rainy
tie
and
a
streaky
skye
which
barked
he
go
then
to
the
surprise
of
willie
and
maude
the
jackarandajam
began
to
dance
wildly
while
the
weather
cock
sang
as
follows
o
the
weather
will
be
fine
if
it
does
not
sleet
or
hail
or
snow
and
if
it
does
not
big
guns
blow
and
the
sun
looks
out
to
shine
the
jackarandajam
stood
on
his
head
again
and
sang
the
second
verse
wrapt
up
in
his
thoughts
he
went
along
his
manner
sad
and
crossed
with
a
windy
strain
he
hummed
a
song
of
thunderbolts
and
frost
he
strode
with
a
barometrical
stride
with
forecasts
on
his
brow
till
he
tripped
up
short
upon
a
slide
which
made
him
vow
a
vow
the
weather
cock
at
once
sang
the
chorus
and
the
jackarandajam
danced
as
before
o
the
weather
will
be
fine
if
there
is
no
fog
or
drenching
rain
and
thunder
does
not
boom
again
and
the
sun
looks
out
to
shine
now
came
the
third
and
last
verse
his
prophesies
got
all
mixed
and
mulled
the
moon
began
to
blink
and
all
his
faculties
were
dulled
when
he
saw
the
dog
star
wink
and
up
on
the
steeple
tall
and
black
the
weather
cock
he
crew
he
crew
and
he
crowed
till
he
fell
in
the
road
o
and
sure
enough
the
weather
cock
did
tumble
into
the
road
and
the
clerk
of
the
weather
and
the
zankiwank
tumbled
helter
skelter
after
him
immediately
they
got
up
again
and
rushed
through
the
window
and
catching
hold
of
the
children
they
whirled
them
round
and
round
singing
the
final
chorus
all
together
o
the
weather
will
be
fine
if
lightning
does
not
flash
on
high
nor
gloomy
be
the
azure
sky
and
the
sun
peeps
out
to
shine
after
which
they
all
disappeared
except
the
zankiwank
and
once
again
they
found
themselves
in
the
street
they
were
both
wrong
muttered
the
zankiwank
to
himself
and
yet
one
was
right
how
could
they
both
be
wrong
then
one
was
right
very
well
then
only
one
was
wrong
corrected
maude
no
they
were
both
wrong
because
i
was
the
right
one
after
all
besides
you
ca
always
prove
a
negative
can
you
how
tiresome
of
you
you
only
mentioned
two
and
now
say
three
i
do
not
believe
you
know
what
you
do
mean
not
often
sometimes
by
accident
you
know
only
do
not
tell
anybody
else
you
are
certainly
very
extraordinary
persons
that
is
all
i
can
say
said
willie
you
do
not
do
anything
quite
rationally
or
naturally
illustration
naturally
why
should
we
we
are
the
great
middle
classes
neither
alive
nor
dead
betwixt
and
between
half
and
half
you
know
for
now
we
are
in
the
spirit
world
only
known
to
poets
and
children
but
do
come
along
or
the
bicycles
will
start
without
us
and
we
have
an
appointment
to
keep
now
how
could
one
even
try
to
tell
such
an
eccentric
creature
as
the
zankiwank
that
he
was
all
wrong
and
talking
fables
and
fibs
and
neither
of
them
attempted
to
correct
these
erroneous
ideas
but
wondering
where
they
were
going
next
maude
and
willie
mounted
the
bicycles
that
came
as
if
by
magic
and
rode
off
at
a
terrific
rate
though
they
had
never
ridden
a
machine
before
they
were
almost
out
of
breath
when
the
zankiwank
called
out
stop
and
away
went
the
bicycles
and
they
found
themselves
standing
in
front
of
an
immense
edifice
with
a
swinging
from
the
gambrel
roof
on
which
was
painted
in
large
golden
letters
time
was
meant
for
slaves
there
was
no
opportunity
to
ascertain
what
the
sign
meant
for
all
at
once
there
darted
out
of
the
shop
mr
swinglebinks
with
whom
they
had
travelled
from
charing
cross
do
waste
your
time
like
that
make
haste
let
me
have
five
minutes
i
am
in
a
hurry
have
you
got
five
minutes
to
spare
asked
the
zankiwank
of
maude
oh
yes
she
replied
why
let
me
have
them
at
once
then
a
gentleman
left
minutes
behind
him
yesterday
and
i
want
to
make
up
for
a
regular
customer
screamed
mr
swinglebinks
to
the
bewildered
children
but
but
o
what
do
you
mean
i
have
got
five
minutes
to
spare
and
devote
them
to
you
if
you
like
but
i
give
them
to
you
as
though
they
were
a
piece
of
toffee
answered
maude
with
much
perplexity
while
willie
stood
not
comprehending
mr
swinglebinks
in
the
least
time
is
a
tough
customer
you
know
he
is
here
he
is
there
he
is
gone
he
is
he
was
he
will
be
yet
you
can
not
trap
time
for
he
is
like
a
sunbeam
muttered
the
zankiwank
as
though
he
never
was
short
of
time
there
that
five
minutes
is
gone
wasted
passed
into
the
vast
vacuum
of
eternity
with
my
friend
shakespeare
of
i
can
tell
you
all
about
time
travels
in
divers
paces
with
divers
persons
i
tell
you
who
time
ambles
withal
who
time
trots
withal
who
time
gallops
withal
and
who
he
stands
still
withal
oh
i
know
father
time
and
all
his
tricks
i
have
counted
the
sands
of
time
i
supply
him
with
his
hour
glass
do
you
apprehend
me
they
certainly
did
not
mr
swinglebinks
was
more
mystifying
than
all
the
other
persons
they
had
encountered
put
together
so
they
made
no
reply
i
am
collecting
time
time
so
my
copy
books
told
me
was
meant
for
slaves
i
always
felt
sorry
for
the
slaves
they
have
no
time
you
know
because
it
is
meant
for
them
lots
of
things
are
meant
for
you
only
you
wo
get
them
britons
never
will
be
slaves
so
they
never
want
for
time
however
as
time
was
meant
for
slaves
i
mean
to
let
them
have
as
much
as
i
can
so
every
spare
minute
or
two
i
can
get
i
of
course
send
them
over
to
them
it
is
ridiculous
you
can
not
measure
time
and
cut
off
a
bit
like
that
ventured
willie
oh
yes
you
can
a
client
of
mine
was
laid
up
the
other
day
in
fact
he
was
in
bed
for
a
fortnight
so
as
he
had
no
use
for
the
time
he
had
on
hand
before
him
he
just
went
to
sleep
and
sent
ten
days
round
to
me
oh
mr
zankiwank
what
is
this
gentleman
saying
said
maude
it
all
perfectly
true
answered
the
zankiwank
you
often
hear
of
somebody
who
has
half
an
hour
to
spare
do
you
of
course
very
good
sometimes
you
will
hear
too
of
somebody
who
has
lost
ten
minutes
i
see
said
willie
and
somebody
else
will
tell
you
they
do
not
know
what
to
do
with
their
time
go
on
cried
both
children
more
puzzled
than
ever
well
instead
of
letting
all
the
time
be
wasted
mr
swinglebinks
has
opened
his
exchange
to
receive
all
the
spare
time
he
can
and
this
he
distributes
amongst
those
who
want
an
hour
or
a
day
or
a
week
but
they
have
to
pay
for
it
pay
for
it
time
is
money
called
out
mr
swinglebinks
there
you
are
if
time
is
money
you
can
exchange
time
for
money
and
money
for
time
is
not
that
feasible
did
anybody
ever
hear
of
such
queer
notions
maude
and
willie
were
quite
tired
through
trying
to
think
the
matter
out
time
was
meant
for
time
is
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
take
time
when
time
take
time
by
the
procrastination
is
the
thief
of
killing
time
is
no
saving
time
is
no
crime
as
quick
as
thought
mr
swinglebinks
exhibited
these
statements
on
his
swinging
sign
one
after
the
other
and
then
he
came
to
them
once
again
are
you
convinced
now
let
me
have
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
send
to
the
poor
slaves
time
was
meant
for
them
you
know
and
you
are
using
their
property
without
acknowledgment
the
zankiwank
looked
on
as
wise
as
an
owl
but
said
nothing
dear
me
how
you
are
wasting
your
time
sitting
there
doing
nothing
said
mr
swinglebinks
distractedly
time
is
money
time
is
money
give
me
some
of
the
time
you
are
losing
illustration
let
us
go
willie
said
maude
do
not
waste
any
more
time
we
have
no
time
to
lose
let
alone
time
to
spare
shall
we
kill
time
she
had
barely
finished
speaking
when
mr
swinglebinks
and
his
time
exchange
disappeared
and
they
were
alone
with
the
zankiwank
but
not
for
long
for
almost
immediately
a
troop
of
school
children
came
bounding
home
from
school
but
children
with
the
oddest
heads
and
faces
ever
seen
they
were
all
carrying
miniature
bellows
in
their
hands
which
they
were
working
up
and
down
with
great
energy
illustration
oh
mr
zankiwank
what
is
the
matter
with
those
children
in
short
frocks
and
knickerbockers
look
at
their
heads
the
zankiwank
gazed
but
expressed
no
surprise
and
yet
the
children
if
they
were
children
certainly
looked
very
queer
for
the
boys
had
got
aged
faces
with
moustaches
and
whiskers
while
the
little
girls
in
frocks
just
reaching
to
their
knees
had
women
faces
with
their
hair
done
up
in
plaits
and
chignons
and
grecian
knot
fashion
with
elderly
bonnets
perched
on
the
top
that
said
the
zankiwank
is
the
force
of
habit
what
habit
please
it
does
not
suit
them
said
maude
you
are
mistaken
good
habits
become
second
nature
and
what
do
bad
habits
become
queried
willie
bad
habits
answered
the
zankiwank
severely
become
no
one
and
these
must
be
bad
habits
exclaimed
willie
pointing
to
the
children
for
they
do
not
become
them
i
thought
their
clothes
fitted
them
very
well
we
do
mean
their
clothes
cried
maude
we
mean
their
general
appearance
ah
you
are
referring
to
the
unnatural
history
aspect
of
the
case
you
mean
their
heads
of
course
they
do
fit
properly
i
have
noticed
it
myself
it
comes
of
expecting
too
much
and
overdoing
it
it
is
all
the
result
of
what
so
many
people
are
fond
of
doing
putting
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
so
the
mystery
was
out
the
old
heads
were
unmistakably
on
young
shoulders
and
how
very
absurd
the
children
looked
not
a
bit
like
happy
girls
and
boys
as
they
would
have
been
had
they
possessed
their
own
heads
instead
of
and
minds
and
brains
old
heads
never
do
look
well
on
young
shoulders
and
it
is
very
foolish
of
people
to
think
they
do
it
makes
them
children
of
a
larger
growth
before
their
time
and
is
just
as
bad
as
having
young
heads
on
old
shoulders
the
moral
of
which
is
that
you
should
never
be
older
than
you
are
nor
younger
than
you
are
not
but
what
are
they
doing
with
those
bellows
enquired
willie
and
maude
together
raising
the
wind
promptly
responded
the
zankiwank
or
trying
to
when
folk
grow
old
before
their
time
you
will
generally
find
that
it
is
owing
to
the
bother
they
had
in
raising
the
wind
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
but
you
do
keep
the
pot
boiling
with
wind
they
protested
oh
yes
you
do
in
land
though
personally
i
believe
it
to
be
most
unright
un
what
exclaimed
maude
unright
when
a
thing
is
wrong
it
must
be
unright
just
the
same
as
when
a
thing
is
right
it
is
unwrong
while
the
zankiwank
was
giving
this
very
lucid
explanation
the
old
heads
on
young
shoulders
children
went
sedately
and
mournfully
away
just
as
a
complete
train
of
newspaper
carts
dashed
up
to
a
large
establishment
with
these
words
printed
outside
atnagagdlintit
ralinginginarmik
lusaruminassumik
good
gracious
what
awful
looking
words
it
surely
must
be
welsh
the
two
children
put
the
question
to
the
zankiwank
no
that
is
not
welsh
that
is
the
way
the
esquimaux
of
greenland
speak
it
is
the
name
of
their
paper
and
means
something
to
read
interesting
news
of
all
sorts
but
in
this
newspaper
they
never
print
any
news
of
any
sort
they
supply
the
paper
to
the
every
morning
quite
blank
so
that
you
can
provide
yourself
with
your
own
news
being
perfectly
blank
the
editors
succeed
in
pleasing
all
their
subscribers
illustration
well
i
do
not
see
any
advantage
in
that
there
you
go
again
cried
the
zankiwank
you
always
want
something
with
an
advantage
what
the
use
of
an
advantage
i
should
like
to
know
you
can
only
lose
it
you
can
not
give
it
away
do
try
to
be
original
but
listen
nobody
coming
they
both
looked
round
wondering
what
the
zankiwank
meant
by
his
strange
perversities
but
could
not
see
anyone
we
can
see
nobody
they
said
of
course
here
he
is
well
was
it
a
shadow
something
was
there
without
a
doubt
and
certainly
without
a
body
it
was
a
sort
of
skeleton
or
a
ghost
or
perhaps
a
mahatma
but
it
was
not
a
mahatma
it
was
in
fact
nobody
of
whom
you
have
of
course
heard
at
last
at
last
screamed
the
delighted
zankiwank
with
your
eyes
wide
open
and
your
faculties
unimpaired
you
see
nobody
and
what
a
memory
nobody
has
how
can
nobody
have
a
memory
besides
we
can
see
nobody
said
maude
more
perplexed
than
she
had
ever
been
exactly
nobody
has
a
charming
memory
memory
as
you
know
is
the
sense
you
forget
with
it
memory
corrected
willie
is
the
sense
if
it
is
a
sense
or
impression
you
remember
with
oh
what
dreadful
grammar
remember
with
how
can
you
finish
a
sentence
with
a
preposition
what
do
you
remember
with
it
demanded
the
zankiwank
reprovingly
anything
everything
you
want
to
replied
willie
another
preposition
ah
if
we
could
only
remember
as
easily
as
we
forget
you
are
wandering
from
the
subject
suggested
maude
the
subject
is
nobody
and
you
have
told
us
nothing
about
it
h
said
the
zankiwank
you
have
confessed
that
you
can
see
nobody
therefore
i
will
request
him
to
sing
you
a
topical
song
now
keep
your
attention
earnestly
directed
towards
nobody
and
listen
knowing
from
past
experience
that
the
zankiwank
would
have
his
own
way
maude
and
willie
having
no
one
else
to
think
about
thought
of
nobody
and
to
their
amazement
they
heard
these
words
sung
as
from
a
long
way
off
in
a
very
hollow
tone
of
voice
nobody
nothing
to
nobody
o
nobody
nothing
to
nobody
and
yet
he
is
something
too
though
it
yet
is
so
odd
he
always
finds
nothing
to
do
when
nobody
does
nothing
wrong
they
say
it
is
the
cat
though
nobody
be
long
and
strong
and
very
likely
fat
his
name
is
heard
from
morn
till
night
he
known
in
place
he
does
the
deeds
that
are
unright
though
no
one
sees
his
face
nobody
broke
the
dresden
vase
nobody
ate
the
cream
nobody
smashed
that
pipe
of
pa
it
happened
in
a
dream
nobody
lost
sophia
doll
nobody
fired
jim
gun
nobody
nearly
choked
poor
poll
nobody
saw
it
done
nobody
cracks
the
china
cups
nobody
steals
the
spoons
nobody
in
the
kitchen
sups
or
talks
of
honeymoons
nobody
courts
the
she
told
us
so
herself
that
nobody
i
much
afraid
is
quite
a
tricky
elf
for
nobody
is
any
one
that
must
be
very
clear
yet
nobody
a
constant
dun
though
no
one
saw
him
here
as
nobody
is
ever
seen
in
anybody
shape
nobody
must
be
epicene
and
very
like
an
ape
for
nobody
nothing
to
nobody
and
yet
he
is
something
too
though
it
yet
is
so
odd
he
always
finds
nothing
to
do
just
as
the
song
was
finished
the
zankiwank
cried
out
in
alarm
there
somebody
coming
and
nobody
disappeared
at
once
for
the
children
saw
nobody
go
and
now
said
the
zankiwank
we
may
expect
the
griffin
from
temple
bar
and
the
phoenix
from
arabia
a
dark
shadow
enveloped
the
square
in
which
they
were
standing
then
there
was
a
weird
perfume
of
damp
fireworks
and
saltpetre
and
before
any
one
could
say
guy
fawkes
the
phoenix
rose
from
his
own
funeral
pyre
of
faded
frankincense
mildewed
myrrh
and
similar
luxuries
and
flapped
his
wings
vigorously
just
as
the
griffin
jumped
off
his
pedestal
which
he
had
brought
with
him
and
piped
out
here
we
are
again
once
in
a
thousand
years
responded
the
phoenix
somewhat
hoarsely
for
he
had
nearly
swallowed
some
of
his
own
ashes
the
griffin
as
everybody
knows
is
shaped
like
an
eagle
from
its
legs
to
the
shoulder
and
the
head
while
the
rest
of
his
body
is
like
that
of
a
lion
the
phoenix
is
also
very
much
like
an
intelligent
eagle
with
gold
and
crimson
plumage
and
an
exceptionally
waggish
tail
it
has
the
advantage
of
fifty
orifices
in
his
bill
through
which
he
occasionally
sings
melodious
songs
to
oblige
the
company
as
he
never
appears
to
anyone
more
than
once
in
five
hundred
years
sometimes
when
he
has
the
toothache
for
instance
only
once
in
a
thousand
years
which
is
why
he
is
called
a
rara
avis
if
you
ever
meet
him
at
any
time
take
particular
notice
of
him
and
if
you
can
draw
if
it
is
only
the
long
bow
make
a
sketch
of
him
he
lives
chiefly
on
poets
which
is
why
so
many
refer
to
him
he
has
been
a
good
friend
to
the
poets
of
all
ages
as
your
cousin
william
will
explain
if
you
have
not
got
a
cousin
william
ask
some
one
who
has
illustration
not
having
the
gift
of
speech
neither
of
them
spoke
but
they
could
sing
and
this
is
what
they
intended
to
say
i
am
a
sacred
bird
you
know
and
i
am
a
griffin
bold
in
arabia
the
blest
we
feather
our
own
nest
to
keep
us
from
the
cold
and
we
so
very
fabulous
oh
that
the
griffin
straight
we
rise
up
from
the
flames
to
play
old
classic
games
like
a
phoenix
then
they
spread
out
their
wings
and
executed
the
most
diverting
feather
dance
ever
seen
out
of
a
pantomime
i
am
a
watchful
bird
you
know
and
i
am
a
phoenix
smart
from
shakespeare
unto
jones
the
welsh
one
who
intones
we
have
played
a
striking
part
for
we
so
very
mystical
both
of
the
brain
the
mongoose
is
our
and
the
nightmare
is
our
and
we
thrive
on
fiction
plain
they
repeated
their
dance
and
then
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
nearest
house
and
begged
pantomimically
for
money
but
as
it
was
washing
day
they
were
refused
so
they
went
into
the
cook
shop
and
had
some
irish
stew
which
did
not
agree
with
them
consequently
they
sprang
into
the
hash
that
was
simmering
on
the
fire
and
were
seen
no
more
whereupon
the
zankiwank
looked
gooseberrily
out
of
his
eyes
and
murmured
as
if
nothing
out
of
the
way
or
in
the
way
had
happened
or
the
phoenix
or
the
griffin
had
existed
the
bletherwitch
will
send
me
a
telegram
to
say
that
she
will
be
ready
for
the
ceremony
in
but
where
is
the
bletherwitch
and
how
do
you
know
asked
maude
somewhat
incredulously
she
is
being
arrayed
for
the
marriage
celebration
at
present
she
is
in
spain
gathering
spanish
onions
but
spanish
onions
do
come
from
spain
you
are
right
it
is
pickled
walnuts
she
is
gathering
from
the
boot
tree
in
the
scullery
however
that
is
of
no
consequence
let
us
be
joyful
as
befits
the
occasion
who
has
got
any
crackers
illustration
before
any
reply
could
be
given
a
voice
in
the
air
screamed
out
beware
of
the
nargalnannacus
at
which
the
zankiwank
trembled
and
the
whole
place
seemed
to
rock
to
and
fro
what
the
nargalnannacus
it
a
noun
how
do
you
mean
a
noun
is
the
name
of
a
person
place
or
thing
i
believe
it
was
yesterday
it
is
and
that
is
what
the
nargalnannacus
is
he
she
or
it
is
a
person
place
or
thing
and
it
travels
about
and
that
is
all
i
know
of
it
nobody
has
ever
seen
a
nargalnannacus
and
nobody
ever
will
not
a
real
proper
authen
authenticated
assisted
maude
thank
you
authenticated
one
directly
they
do
they
turn
yellow
and
green
and
are
seen
no
more
what
are
we
to
do
then
anxiously
enquired
willie
the
best
that
offers
we
have
been
expecting
an
outbreak
for
a
long
time
and
here
comes
the
court
physician
dr
pampleton
to
happily
confirm
my
worst
suspicions
the
children
thought
it
extremely
odd
that
having
one
worst
suspicions
confirmed
should
make
any
person
happy
but
they
were
accustomed
to
the
zankiwank
curious
modes
of
speech
and
lack
of
logic
so
that
they
wisely
held
their
tongues
in
silence
the
newcomer
was
of
very
remarkable
appearance
he
was
tall
and
slim
like
the
zankiwank
but
instead
of
having
the
ordinary
shaped
head
and
face
he
carried
on
his
shoulders
a
sheep
head
and
in
his
veins
so
they
heard
afterwards
ran
sheep
blood
at
one
period
of
his
existence
he
had
been
for
his
propensities
and
he
was
now
strongly
recommended
as
being
able
to
commit
more
mistakes
and
blunders
in
than
a
school
boy
could
in
a
whole
school
term
he
had
one
great
virtue
however
and
that
was
that
he
would
always
instantly
apologise
for
any
error
he
might
make
illustration
he
never
travelled
without
his
medicine
chest
which
he
carried
by
straps
over
his
shoulders
and
was
prepared
to
give
anybody
a
dose
of
physic
without
the
slightest
provocation
at
double
charges
there
is
danger
ahead
he
whispered
to
the
zankiwank
and
a
lot
of
visitors
are
coming
to
fight
to
the
bitter
end
tell
me
their
names
cried
the
zankiwank
excitedly
whereupon
dr
pampleton
recited
them
as
follows
the
zankiwank
groaning
as
each
cognomen
was
uttered
the
wollypog
the
fustilug
and
the
woogabblewabble
bogglewoggle
and
all
his
court
the
last
was
too
much
for
the
zankiwank
for
he
immediately
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
tallest
steeple
in
the
town
saying
with
much
discretion
i
will
see
that
all
is
fair
i
will
be
the
judge
maude
had
only
just
got
time
to
eat
some
of
the
fern
seeds
she
had
saved
from
what
robin
goodfellow
had
given
her
and
to
give
some
to
willie
when
a
rushing
as
of
many
waters
and
a
roaring
as
of
the
bursting
of
several
gasometers
were
heard
and
a
noise
of
some
two
or
three
hundred
tramping
soldiers
smote
upon
their
ears
and
they
knew
that
something
dreadful
was
going
to
happen
as
the
bogglewoggle
and
the
wollypog
and
all
the
others
came
upon
the
scene
both
the
children
recognised
them
from
what
they
had
once
read
in
a
fairy
book
as
being
the
monsters
of
the
secret
cavern
it
was
not
going
to
be
a
battle
as
they
could
see
it
was
only
to
be
a
quiet
fight
between
the
important
folk
of
the
secret
cavern
and
topsy
turvey
land
the
jorumgander
was
there
and
so
was
the
jackarandajam
and
mr
swinglebinks
and
all
the
others
they
had
been
introduced
to
the
bogglewoggle
was
particularly
noisy
in
calling
out
for
the
zankiwank
but
as
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
of
course
he
could
not
risk
his
life
just
for
the
mere
whim
of
a
dragon
who
was
setting
everything
alight
with
his
tail
and
then
they
all
commenced
to
fight
cutting
slashing
and
crashing
each
other
with
swords
while
the
inhabitants
applauded
and
the
bands
played
the
conquering
hero
although
there
was
not
any
creature
who
conquered
that
one
could
distinguish
it
was
a
terrible
sight
they
never
ceased
for
a
minute
but
went
on
cutting
each
other
to
pieces
until
at
last
they
all
lay
dead
upon
the
ground
no
one
was
left
alive
to
tell
the
awful
news
but
the
zankiwank
and
dr
pampleton
and
what
was
most
remarkable
about
the
fight
was
that
it
was
all
done
out
of
pure
friendship
but
friendship
does
not
seem
to
be
much
good
when
all
your
friends
are
scattered
about
as
these
were
heads
and
arms
and
legs
everywhere
and
there
certainly
did
not
appear
to
be
much
hope
of
their
ever
being
able
to
do
any
more
damage
the
zankiwank
crept
cautiously
down
from
his
pinnacle
and
joined
dr
pampleton
our
friends
are
very
much
cut
up
said
dr
pampleton
what
is
to
be
done
the
zankiwank
enquired
done
why
with
my
special
elixir
i
shall
bring
them
all
to
life
again
said
the
court
physician
promptly
will
you
can
you
of
course
you
get
all
the
bodies
and
lay
them
in
a
line
i
gather
up
the
heads
and
stick
on
with
elastic
glue
then
you
find
the
arms
and
legs
and
we
will
soon
have
them
ready
for
another
bout
so
the
zankiwank
sent
the
rest
of
the
populace
that
had
been
looking
on
indoors
to
get
their
tea
while
he
set
to
work
and
did
as
that
absurd
old
doctor
instructed
him
illustration
willie
and
maude
could
scarcely
keep
their
eyes
open
but
they
were
so
interested
in
the
proceedings
that
they
managed
to
see
that
the
court
physician
with
his
usual
foresight
was
sticking
the
heads
on
the
wrong
bodies
and
the
arms
and
legs
he
put
on
just
as
they
were
handed
to
him
left
on
the
right
and
right
on
the
left
and
no
one
individual
got
his
own
proper
limbs
fastened
to
him
it
was
the
funniest
thing
they
had
ever
seen
better
than
any
pantomime
for
sure
enough
they
all
came
to
life
again
and
naturally
seeing
another
person
arms
and
legs
on
their
bodies
they
imagined
themselves
to
be
somebody
else
entirely
and
then
ensued
the
most
deafening
confusion
conceivable
each
one
accusing
the
other
of
having
robbed
him
in
his
sleep
for
they
were
under
the
impression
that
they
had
been
to
bed
in
a
strange
place
and
so
they
had
it
was
the
grandest
transformation
scene
ever
witnessed
the
zankiwank
was
in
deep
distress
but
dr
pampleton
was
in
high
glee
and
laughed
immoderately
such
a
funny
mistake
to
make
he
crowed
hysterically
to
the
hopping
hobbling
jumping
crowd
of
monsters
and
dwarfs
who
were
glaring
at
each
other
in
a
very
savage
manner
i
beg
your
pardon
my
fault
all
lie
down
again
and
i
will
cut
you
up
once
more
and
put
you
together
correctly
this
time
said
the
court
physician
pleasantly
so
they
all
bellowed
in
chorus
it
is
you
who
have
done
all
this
mischief
come
on
we
will
soon
rectify
your
blunder
and
with
a
swish
and
a
swirl
they
made
one
simultaneous
movement
towards
the
unfortunate
pampleton
and
once
again
pandemonium
was
let
loose
when
high
above
the
din
the
voice
of
the
zankiwank
was
heard
calling
upon
them
to
have
patience
and
not
to
disturb
the
harmony
as
the
bletherwitch
had
arrived
at
last
meanwhile
everybody
rushed
madly
down
the
street
after
the
court
physician
but
the
children
could
see
nothing
now
everything
was
growing
dim
and
dimmer
and
the
scene
was
fading
fading
away
into
a
blue
light
and
the
last
they
heard
was
the
zankiwank
speaking
tenderly
to
the
bletherwitch
whom
they
were
not
destined
to
see
after
all
and
saying
oh
my
sweet
blethery
blethery
bletherwitch
what
a
bletherwitching
little
thing
you
are
then
there
was
a
rumbling
and
a
tumbling
and
something
stopped
suddenly
a
light
was
flashed
before
their
eyes
and
hey
presto
there
was
john
opening
the
carriage
door
for
them
to
get
out
and
wonder
of
wonders
there
were
their
dear
mother
and
father
standing
in
the
hall
of
their
own
home
waiting
to
receive
them
and
presently
they
were
being
kissed
and
caressed
and
petted
because
as
mary
their
nurse
said
they
had
slept
in
the
carriage
all
the
way
home
from
the
visit
to
their
grandmama
illustration
this
however
they
stoutly
denied
they
knew
better
than
that
and
told
their
parents
of
all
their
adventures
which
as
they
declared
if
they
were
not
true
they
ought
to
be
and
so
they
said
goodnight
and
dreamt
their
dreams
if
they
were
dreams
all
over
again
