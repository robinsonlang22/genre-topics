preface
our
fun
for
the
children
between
the
ages
of
one
and
one
hundred
and
incidentally
the
elimination
of
deceit
and
gore
in
the
telling
two
elements
that
enter
we
think
too
vitally
into
the
construction
of
most
fairy
tales
as
to
the
that
is
not
obtrusive
but
if
we
can
suggest
to
the
children
that
fear
alone
can
harm
them
through
life
journey
and
to
silly
nurses
and
thoughtless
parents
that
the
serious
use
of
ghost
stories
bogie
men
and
bugbears
of
all
kinds
for
the
sheer
purpose
of
frightening
or
making
a
child
mind
is
positively
wicked
we
will
admit
that
the
tale
has
a
moral
chapter
i
dark
plot
of
nickel
plate
the
polished
villain
nickel
plate
the
polished
villain
sat
in
his
office
in
the
north
south
corner
of
the
first
straight
turning
to
the
left
of
the
castle
in
plotville
gadzooks
exclaimed
he
with
a
heavy
frown
likewise
pish
tush
methinks
i
grow
rusty
it
is
indeed
a
sad
world
when
a
real
villain
is
reduced
to
chewing
his
moustache
and
biting
his
lips
instead
of
feasting
on
the
fat
of
the
land
so
saying
he
rose
from
his
chair
smote
himself
heavily
on
the
chest
carefully
twirled
his
long
black
moustache
and
paced
dejectedly
up
and
down
and
across
the
room
i
wonder
he
began
when
the
telephone
rang
hello
said
he
yes
this
is
nickel
plate
oh
good
morning
bogie
man

speak
so
loudly
some
one
may
see

not
returned

but
i
expect
him
every
minute

let
you
know
as
soon
as
i
can
oh
yes
he
is
to
substitute
glucose
for
honey
girl
and
return
here
for
further
villainous
orders
oh
a
excuse
me
but
can
you
help
me
with
a
little
loan
of
hello
hello

off
central
central
wo

me
bogie
man

again
now
then
what
am
i
to
do
i
have
just
one
nickel
to
my
name
and
i
ca
spend
that
if
bumbus
has
failed
i
do
know
what
we
shall
do
a
fine
state
of
affairs
for
a
man
with
an
ossified
conscience
and
a
good
digestion
what
is
that
came
a
sound
through
the
open
window
is
that
bumbus
called
nickel
plate
in
a
loud
whisper
i
be
answered
bumbus
climbing
over
the
sill
and
darting
to
a
chair
why
did
you
come
in
by
the
door
you
know
how
paneful
a
window
is
to
me
when
a
cow
said
bumbus
perching
himself
on
the
back
of
his
chair
and
fanning
himself
with
his
foot
sometimes
i
think
began
nickel
plate
angrily
wrong
answer
besides
it
not
strictly
true
said
bumbus
turning
his
large
eyes
here
and
there
as
he
viewed
his
master
a
truce
to
foolishness
said
nickel
plate
what
news
but
wait
and
taking
two
wads
of
cotton
out
of
his
pocket
he
stuffed
them
in
two
cracks
in
the
wall
walls
have
ears
we
will
stop
them
up
proceed
honey
girl
has
disappeared
whispered
bumbus
gone
and
her
golden
comb
she
has
taken
it
with
her
gone
growled
nickel
plate
but
wait
i
am
not
angry
enough
for
a
real
villain
lighting
a
match
he
quickly
swallowed
it
ha
ha
now
i
am
indeed
a
fire
eater
gadzooks
varlet
and
how
did
she
escape
us
bumbus
hung
his
head
alas
sir
with
much
care
did
i
carry
glucose
to
the
palace
of
the
queen
bee
to
substitute
her
for
honey
girl
dressed
to
look
exactly
like
her
even
to
a
comb
i
had
bribed
drone
the
sentry
to
admit
us
in
the
dead
of
night
creeping
softly
through
the
corridors
of
the
castle
with
glucose
in
my
arms
i
came
to
the
door
of
honey
girl
i
opened
the
door
and
crept
quietly
into
the
room
all
was
still
i
reached
the
dainty
couch
and
found
yes
said
nickel
plate
excitedly
i
found
it
empty
honey
girl
had
fled
sweet
honey
girl
alas
have
we
lost
you
also
which
is
more
important
the
reward
for
the
abduction
but
revenge
revenge
hissed
nickel
plate
what
did
you
do
with
glucose
glucose
has
gone
back
to
her
work
in
the
factory
said
bumbus
but
will
come
back
to
us
whenever
we
wish
enough
said
nickel
plate
bogie
man
must
know
of
this
at
once
i
will
telephone
him
but
no
he
has
stopped
the
connection
will
you
take
the
message
sir
you
forget
too
true
i
need
you
here
a
messenger
so
saying
nickel
plate
rang
the
messenger
call
and
sat
down
to
write
the
note
of
explanation
to
bogie
man
came
a
knock
on
the
door
come
in
said
nickel
plate
in
a
deep
bass
voice
the
one
he
kept
for
strangers
the
door
popped
open
and
in
ran
yes
he
really
ran
a
messenger
boy
and
such
a
messenger
boy
such
bright
quick
eyes
such
a
clean
face
and
hands
not
even
a
high
water
line
on
his
neck
and
wrists
such
twinkling
feet
and
such
a
well
brushed
uniform
why
you
would
hardly
believe
he
was
a
messenger
boy
if
you
saw
him
he
was
such
an
active
little
fellow
did
you
ring

said
billy
hoping

the
real
bogie
man

meant

said
nickel
plate
but
sir
i
do
know
where

such
a
lazy

hummed
bumbus
lazy

lazy

his

in
a
whirl

that
your
lookout

more

will
have
to
take
the
message
good
day
said
nickel
plate
handing
billy
the
note
but
sir
bumbus
jumped
off
his
chair
and
slowly
revolved
around
billy
humming
little
boy
billy
boy
do
as
you
told
refusal

rudeness
i
surely
shall
scold

your
hat
there
the
door
run
while
you
may
i
have
the
great
pleasure
to
wish
you
as
he
sang
this
bumbus
circled
closer
and
closer
to
billy
until
finally
he
touched
him
digging
him
in
the
ribs
and
giving
him
gentle
pushes
toward
the
door
suddenly
billy
found
himself
outside
of
the
room
with
the
door
slammed
in
his
face
well
said
billy
staring
at
the
note
in
his
hand
i
glad
i
out
of
that
room
anyway
then
looking
up
at
the
door
he
read
painted
in
bold
black
letters
on
the
glass
nickel
plate
polished
villain
short
and
long
orders
in
all
kinds
of
villainy
promptly
executed
abductions
a
specialty
and
lower
down
in
smaller
letters
i
bumbus
assistant
villain
office
hours
between

to

discharged
and
if
i
do
deliver
it
but
how
can
i
oh
pshaw
i
know
i
asleep
ouch
for
he
had
given
himself
a
sharp
nip
in
the
calf
of
his
leg
to
wake
himself
but
there
was
the
note
still
in
his
hand
and
there
in
front
of
him
stood
the
building
he
had
just
left
i
awake
that
certain
and
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
for
he
had
bumped
into
a
little
old
gentleman
who
was
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
illustration
now
said
gas
be
careful
not
to
sit
on
the
ceiling
page
it
gas
the
balloon
maker
cried
billy
joyfully
perhaps
you
can
help
me
it
a
good
thing
i
ran
into
you
humph
said
gas
with
his
hands
on
his
stomach
it
not
a
very
good
thing
for
me
that
you
ran
into
me
but
i
glad
to
see
you
i
am
sorry
gas
but
i
really
in
very
serious
trouble
said
billy
with
a
sigh
gas
smiled
i
might
have
known
you
did
know
the
way
to
bogie
man
house
why
said
billy
in
surprise
how
did
you
know
gift
horses
ca
be
choosers
which
means
do
ask
any
questions
said
gas
pinching
billy
ear
but
come
along
to
my
house
and
i
help
you
now
said
gas
when
they
had
entered
the
shop
where
he
made
all
the
toy
balloons
for
all
the
little
boys
and
girls
in
all
the
world
be
careful
not
to
sit
on
the
ceiling
because
if
you
do
you
burst
some
of
my
balloons
billy
laughed
sit
on
the
ceiling
why
how
could
i
wait
and
see
said
gas
nothing
is
impossible
to
your
fairy
godfather
are
you
my
fairy
godfather
asked
billy
opening
his
eyes
very
very
wide
on
sundays
and
week
days
i
am
the
rest
of
the
time
i
not
but
what
other
days
are
there
said
billy
strong
days
of
course
i
thought
you
knew
geography
said
gas
huffily
yes
sir
i
suppose
so
said
billy
afraid
to
ask
any
more
questions
now
then
put
on
this
suit
said
the
balloon
maker
producing
what
looked
like
a
big
rubber
bag
yes
sir
but
of
course
it
wrong
side
out
how
can
i
get
the
right
side
inside
unless
the
wrong
side
is
outside
of
the
inside
of
the
outside
of
the
inside
of
your
outside
clothes
anybody
who
can
count
his
chickens
before
they
are
hatched
ought
to
know
that
billy
gasped
and
proceeded
to
pull
the
suit
on
over
his
messenger
uniform
stand
on
your
head
billy
knew
how
to
do
this
he
had
practiced
it
often
enough
against
fences
when
he
should
have
been
delivering
messages
taking
one
of
billy
trouser
legs
in
each
hand
gas
gave
a
quick
jerk
and
billy
found
himself
standing
on
his
feet
with
the
rubber
suit
inside
of
his
uniform
there
said
gas
that
done
the
next
thing
is
to
blow
you
up
oh
gas
please
do
do
that
said
billy
thinking
of
gunpowder
and
things
with
a
hot
air
pump
stand
quiet
went
the
pump
and
there
stood
billy
like
a
great
round
butter
ball
his
uniform
fitted
as
close
and
snug
on
the
rubber
suit
as
the
skin
on
an
onion
for
that
was
a
peculiar
property
of
the
rubber
suit
any
clothes
loose
tight
or
otherwise
were
bound
to
fit
over
it
thank
you
sir
said
billy
looking
down
and
trying
to
see
his
foot
but
here
the
hot
air
pump
put
it
in
your
now
be
careful
do
jump
or
you
bump
your
head
you
ready
now
to
hunt
bogie
man
how
am
i
to
get
there
jump
there
of
course
replied
gas
when
you
get
outside
the
door
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
jump
into
the
air
that
will
carry
you
out
of
town
then
keep
on
jumping
till
you
get
there
that
simple
is
it
but
ca
you
tell
me
in
which
direction
to
jump
asked
billy
jump
up
of
course
if
you
jump
down
you
dent
the
sidewalk
but
shall
i
jump
north
or
east
or
south
or
west
sir
exactly
just
follow
those
directions
and
you
will
be
sure
to
arrive
but
wait
before
you
start
i
give
you
barker
my
little
dog
what
kind
of
a
dog
is
he
asked
billy
a
yellow
cur
he
won
the
booby
prize
at
the
last
dog
show
thank
you
sir
but
wo
you
keep
him
for
me
until
i
get
back
do
jump
to
conclusions
billy
it
strains
the
suit
barker
will
help
you
when
you
want
shade
or
shelter
by
night
or
day
is
he
rather
a
small
dog
for
me
to
get
under
asked
billy
looking
at
the
tiny
animal
gas
held
out
to
him
gas
stamped
his
foot
more
questions
listen
when
night
or
rain
comes
on
drop
to
the
ground
dig
a
little
hole
hold
barker
nose
over
it
and
pinch
his
tail
to
make
him
bark
shovel
in
the
dirt
and
of
course
you
will
have
planted
his
bark
well
you
know
what
is
planted
must
grow
so
up
will
come
the
bark
and
the
boughs
and
you
can
shelter
yourself
all
night
beneath
the
singing
tree
billy
took
the
dog
and
started
out
of
the
door
thank
you
is
that
all
sir
of
course
not
said
gas
yes
sir
asked
billy
in
surprise
i
thought
you
said
yes
that
it
we
had
to
say
before
it
could
be
all
oh
said
billy
and
going
outside
took
a
great
big
jump
up
into
the
air
chapter
ii
a
jump
to
shamville
up
up
up
went
billy
when
he
took
his
leap
into
the
air
way
above
the
house
tops
past
the
city
over
green
fields
hills
and
valleys
crossing
brooks
and
rivers
that
looked
like
little
threads
of
silver
so
far
below
were
they
until
he
thought
he
never
would
alight
finally
things
began
to
get
larger
and
larger
and
larger
on
the
earth
and
he
knew
he
was
floating
gently
down
down
down
it
was
just
like
going
down
from
the
story
in
a
very
slow
very
comfortable
elevator
plump
and
billy
was
on
the
ground
before
him
stood
a
city
this
seemed
strange
for
he
knew
he
had
seen
it
until
his
feet
touched
mother
earth
excuse
me
sir
said
billy
to
a
tall
thin
rusty
coated
man
who
was
looking
intently
at
the
heavens
through
a
long
hollow
tube
open
at
both
ends
oh
you
here
are
you
said
the
man
lowering
the
tube
and
looking
at
billy
i
been
waiting
for
you
to
come
down
yes
sir
said
billy
excuse
me
but
what
city
is
this
shamville
so
you
are
a
meteor
no
sir
i
a
messenger
said
billy
pardon
me
but
you
a
meteor
by
right
of
discovery
and
i
ought
to
know
for
i
a
near
astronomer
a
near
what
not
a
near
what
but
a
near
astronomer
with
my
near
telescope
i
have
nearly
discovered
hundreds
of
nearly
new
stars
said
the
man
looking
very
very
wise
oh
i
see
said
billy
smiling
well
sir
you
may
be
a
near
astronomer
but
in
this
case
you
are
not
near
right
well
you
a
near
meteor
and
that
will
do
well
enough
in
shamville
by
this
time
they
had
entered
the
city
who
is
that
long
haired
greasy
gentleman
writing
on
his
cuff
asked
billy
you
must
meet
him
he
is
our
village
near
poet
answered
the
impressively
allow
me
never
print
to
introduce
my
latest
discovery
billy
bounce
a
near
meteor
never
print
stopped
writing
and
after
rolling
his
eyes
and
carefully
disarranging
his
hair
said
how
beautiful
a
thing
is
a
fried
oyster
have
you
read
my
latest
near
book
no
sir
said
billy
ah
such
is
near
fame
said
the
poet
untying
his
cravat
art
is
long
but
a
toothless
dog
does
not
bite
sir
said
billy
i
did
quite
catch
your
meaning
illustration
near
the
near
meaning
you
mean
like
all
great
near
poets
my
meaning
is
hidden
perhaps
you
will
understand
this
better
the
little
flower
like
a
beefsteak
reminds
us
that
a
gentle
answer
comes
home
to
roost
billy
was
so
bewildered
by
this
that
he
leaned
against
a
wall
or
rather
he
leaned
on
what
looked
like
a
wall
as
the
near
astronomer
helped
him
to
his
feet
he
said
be
careful
of
the
near
walls
they
just
painted
canvas
you
know
and
are
not
meant
to
lean
against
thank
you
said
billy
is
there
anything
here
that
is
not
an
imitation
oh
no
answered
the
astronomer
this
is
shamville
but
i
assure
you
we
all
just
as
good
as
the
original
well
i
must
be
off
said
billy
i
must
deliver
this
note
to
bogie
man
to
whom
to
bogie
man
can
you
tell
me
how
to
get
there
oh
my
goodness
oh
my
gracious
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
cried
the
astronomer
beating
himself
over
the
head
with
his
near
telescope
i
do
know
sir
i
sure
said
billy
from
what
i
seen
i
should
think
you
had
ever
done
anything
hear
him
hear
him
screamed
the
astronomer
then
calling
to
the
people
on
the
streets
come
come
come
near
everybody
we
have
in
our
midst
one
who
would
expose
us
to
the
people
who
really
do
things
with
fearful
cries
the
entire
population
made
one
dash
for
billy
who
forgetting
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
jump
tried
to
run
in
his
big
suit
he
found
this
almost
impossible
and
soon
he
was
surrounded
by
an
excited
mob
roast
him
at
the
steak
cried
the
butcher
still
holding
in
his
hands
the
papier
mache
chicken
he
had
been
selling
when
the
call
came
splendid
said
the
near
poet
boil
him
in
oil
suggested
the
near
artist
what
is
it
forgery
asked
the
blacksmith
put
him
in
a
cell
said
the
merchant
billy
saw
that
he
was
in
a
tight
place
and
must
act
quickly
no
one
had
as
yet
taken
hold
of
him
they
were
all
too
excited
to
think
of
that
but
he
knew
a
near
policeman
was
even
then
trying
to
edge
through
the
crowd
and
something
must
be
done
just
then
the
near
astronomer
put
out
a
hand
to
seize
billy
collar
quick
as
a
wink
billy
reached
up
and
pushed
the
star
gazer
plug
hat
right
down
over
his
eyes
you
ca
see
stars
this
time
at
any
rate
said
billy
and
then
was
surprised
to
find
himself
rising
rising
rising
off
of
the
ground
in
hitting
he
had
jumped
up
to
reach
the
star
gazer
hat
and
of
course
up
he
went
called
billy
to
the
astonished
crowd
i
had
forgotten
that
you
could
do
any
more
than
catch
me
or
i
should
not
have
been
frightened
and
the
last
billy
ever
saw
of
shamville
was
a
great
sea
of
big
round
eyes
and
wide
open
mouths
i
wonder
whether
this
is
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
my
adventures
said
billy
to
himself
i
hope
it
is
the
last
because
i
really
want
to
deliver
this
note
to
bogie
man
as
soon
as
i
can
they
will
think
it
strange
at
the
office
if
i
gone
longer
than
a
week
delivering
one
message
my
goodness
can
that
be
a
cyclone
for
just
ahead
of
him
billy
saw
a
great
cloud
from
which
came
a
why
it
a
swarm
of
bees
and
they
are
carrying
something
i
do
hope
they
wo
sting
me
by
this
time
billy
had
met
them
and
of
course
as
he
could
steer
himself
in
the
air
the
bees
had
to
get
out
of
the
way
said
a
big
old
fat
bee
clearing
his
throat
what
sort
of
a
beetle
are
you
i
i
a
boy
said
billy
very
very
politely
because
he
saw
that
the
soldier
bees
had
fixed
sting
bayonets
i
never
heard
of
a
beetle
boy
stop
a
minute
i
want
to
look
at
you
i
sorry
sir
said
billy
but
i
ca
illustration
we
soon
fix
that
shouted
the
old
bee
general
ho
guard
seize
him
and
in
a
twinkling
billy
found
himself
in
the
grasp
of
the
bees
now
of
course
as
soon
as
billy
stopped
moving
forward
he
had
to
drop
to
earth
so
down
down
down
he
went
with
the
excited
bee
soldiers
clinging
to
him
and
flapping
their
wings
in
a
vain
endeavor
to
keep
him
and
themselves
up
in
the
air
and
almost
on
top
of
them
dropped
the
fussy
old
bee
general
now
see
what
you
done
beetle
boy
said
he
what
do
you
mean
by
interfering
with
the
queen
own
yellow
jackets
on
the
public
before
billy
could
answer
a
sweet
girlish
voice
said
what
is
the
matter
general
merchandise
we
caught
a
or
something
equally
wicked
princess
honey
girl
said
the
general
gravely
saluting
indeed
miss
said
billy
kneeling
as
well
as
he
could
in
his
suit
before
the
beautiful
golden
haired
maiden
who
had
stepped
out
of
her
palanquin
and
stood
looking
at
him
indeed
miss
i
not
any
of
the
things
this
bee
gentleman
calls
me
i
just
a
messenger
boy
there
now
what
did
i
tell
you
shouted
the
general
just
a
minute
ago
he
said
he
was
a
beetle
boy
ho
guard
oh
that
so
already
ho
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
you
were
the
one
that
said
i
was
a
beetle
boy
do
contradict
said
general
merchandise
why
did
you
tell
me
you
were
then
that
would
be
contradicting
sir
said
billy
laughing
in
spite
of
his
fears
general
said
the
princess
let
me
speak
if
you
will
promise
not
to
talk
said
the
general
bowing
first
then
soldiers
take
your
hands
off
messenger
boy
billy
bounce
is
my
name
princess
murmured
billy
ha
growled
the
general
half
to
himself
another
name
eh
silence
general
i
ca
forget
that
my
aunt
queen
bee
she
not
an
ant
she
a
bee
said
the
general
sulkily
silence
sir
you
forget
yourself
i
say
that
i
can
not
forget
that
my
aunt
queen
bee
whose
heir
i
am
bestowed
the
title
of
general
merchandise
upon
you
because
she
set
such
store
by
you
but
i
can
not
stand
these
interruptions
pardon
your
highness
said
the
general
humbly
granted
now
billy
bounce
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
nothing
princess
answered
billy
except
that
i
am
carrying
a
message
from
nickel
plate
to
bogie
man
and
my
bitter
enemy
cried
the
princess
i
told
you
so
shouted
the
general
ho
guards
seize
him
billy
found
himself
again
seized
and
very
roughly
this
time
indeed
had
it
not
been
for
the
toughness
of
his
rubber
suit
he
would
have
surely
been
stung
but
nothing
daunted
he
said
your
enemies
princess
honey
girl
then
they
are
mine
what
do
you
mean
asked
she
blushing
i
mean
said
billy
earnestly
that
if
i
were
not
a
messenger
boy
who
has
to
do
his
duty
under
any
circumstances
and
had
i
known
that
these
were
your
enemies
i
should
not
have
carried
their
message
then
why
do
you
said
the
general
give
me
the
message
and
you
shall
be
free
no
said
billy
i
can
not
do
that
i
have
undertaken
to
carry
it
and
my
honor
demands
that
i
do
so
while
i
live
you
are
right
said
the
general
then
the
best
way
out
of
the
difficulty
is
to
kill
you
no
said
the
princess
that
shall
not
be
done
thank
you
princess
whispered
billy
you
shall
not
regret
it
let
me
do
my
duty
let
me
carry
the
message
then
when
it
is
delivered
i
shall
be
free
to
fight
for
you
indeed
when
i
am
once
in
bogie
castle
i
shall
be
in
the
very
best
position
to
help
you
good
said
the
princess
good
said
the
general
good
said
all
the
soldiers
but
why
are
nickel
plate
bumbus
and
bogie
man
your
enemies
asked
billy
because
they
want
to
carry
me
far
away
from
the
bee
palace
and
make
me
work
in
the
factory
answered
the
princess
sadly
putting
the
wicked
glucose
who
looks
almost
exactly
like
me
in
my
place
in
the
castle
but
why
said
billy
i
am
crown
princess
and
if
they
can
do
away
with
me
and
substitute
glucose
for
me
they
will
be
in
control
of
the
castle
and
the
bee
government
and
can
make
a
corner
in
honey
villains
cried
billy
but
between
us
we
will
foil
them
you
help
me
said
the
princess
looking
earnestly
at
him
i
will
i
promise
you
but
now
i
must
be
on
my
way
billy
bounce
do
forget
me
said
the
princess
i
will
see
you
soon
honey
girl
and
with
a
farewell
wave
to
the
princess
the
general
and
all
the
soldier
bees
billy
jumped
up
and
away
in
further
search
of
bogie
man
chapter
iii
billy
is
captured
by
tomato
billy
had
floated
a
long
long
time
through
the
sweet
soft
air
indeed
he
was
gently
settling
down
to
earth
again
when
he
discovered
that
the
jolly
old
red
faced
sun
was
rolling
off
to
his
bed
in
the
far
west
well
said
he
to
himself
if
father
sun
is
going
to
turn
in
for
the
night
and
i
see
him
putting
on
his
white
cloud
night
cap
i
expect
it
about
time
for
me
to
do
the
same
came
a
faint
bark
from
under
his
coat
why
it
barker
said
billy
reaching
in
and
patting
a
warm
little
head
i
almost
forgotten
you
old
doggie
and
i
thank
you
for
reminding
me
of
the
singing
tree
in
a
twinkling
billy
was
on
the
ground
and
digging
a
hole
in
the
soft
earth
i
hate
to
pinch
your
tail
old
fellow
said
billy
but
it
really
necessary
you
know
and
holding
barker
nose
over
the
hole
he
gave
his
tail
a
gentle
tweak
quickly
billy
shovelled
in
the
earth
and
lo
and
behold
quicker
than
i
can
tell
you
about
it
there
stood
the
singing
tree
bowing
and
smiling
just
as
billy
was
going
to
wish
the
tree
a
polite
good
evening
he
saw
barker
scampering
after
a
little
beam
of
sunlight
that
had
crept
in
through
the
branches
of
the
tree
barker
come
here
called
billy
but
he
was
too
late
snap
gulp
and
barker
had
swallowed
the
sunlight
i
hope
it
wo
make
you
sick
doggie
said
billy
looking
at
him
anxiously
but
barker
wrinkled
his
nose
at
him
in
such
a
happy
dog
smile
and
wagged
his
stubby
little
tail
so
contentedly
that
billy
decided
he
was
used
to
the
diet
and
turned
to
the
singing
tree
good
evening
said
billy
i
hope
you
are
well
mi
sang
the
tree
pause
and
rest
at
my
bass
excuse
me
sir
but
what
is
your
name
said
billy
you
see
i
like
to
know
how
to
address
you
octavious
minor
sang
the
tree
but
it
time
you
slept
look
sharp
for
accidental
intruders
and
pitch
into
them
with
my
staff
if
they
bother
us
good
night
then
he
began
to
sing
softly
when
the
clucking
cows
have
gone
to
roost
and
the
milk
hens
all
are
fed
when
the
sheep
have
sung
their
young
to
wake
and
the
bats
have
gone
to
bed
when
the
sun
has
risen
in
the
west
and
the
golden
moon
has
sunk
when
the
gentle
watch
dog
wound
and
set
and
the
day
owl
in
his
bunk
it
time
for
wakeful
boys
to
sleep
despite
the
hooting
lark
for
yesterday
will
soon
be
here
and
work
begins
with
dark
and
when
the
tree
got
to
this
point
in
his
song
he
stopped
for
billy
was
sound
asleep
with
barker
snuggled
up
in
his
arms
while
from
his
lips
came
a
contented
snore
billy
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
the
singing
tree
tickling
him
gently
on
the
nose
with
one
of
its
branches
up
up
it
sang
barker
thinking
it
was
calling
up
pup
jumped
up
and
ran
madly
around
the
tree
for
his
morning
exercise
and
then
suddenly
there
was
no
tree
barker
did
notice
this
at
first
and
circled
around
where
the
tree
had
been
three
times
more
before
he
discovered
that
it
was
gone
have
you
ever
seen
a
dog
look
surprised
and
hurt
and
just
a
little
bit
ashamed
well
that
the
way
barker
looked
when
billy
picked
him
up
and
stowed
him
away
again
in
his
jacket
well
i
must
be
off
said
billy
to
himself
do
hurry
said
a
voice
at
his
elbow
billy
was
so
startled
that
he
stepped
back
caught
his
foot
in
a
vine
and
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
ground
there
where
a
minute
before
had
been
nothing
at
all
stood
a
great
red
tomato
leaning
on
its
vine
it
it
a
fine
morning
sir
said
billy
a
vine
morning
you
mean
said
the
tomato
sourly
i
beg
your
pardon
said
billy
because
he
had
quite
understood
the
tomato
granted
for
just
this
once
but
do
do
it
again
what
anything
great
tin
cans
how
i
hate
boys
i
sorry
sir
said
billy
no
you
not
grumbled
the
tomato
you
say
you
are
but
not
boys
are
never
sorry
why
do
you
like
boys
sir
i
sure
and
then
he
stopped
he
was
on
the
point
of
saying
boys
like
tomatoes
when
he
remembered
that
this
might
sound
a
little
personal
and
thought
better
of
it
the
tomato
did
not
notice
this
however
and
said
wiping
a
dew
tear
from
his
eye
a
boy
threw
my
favourite
sister
at
a
cat
last
week
and
i
have
never
been
able
to
abide
boys
since
and
come
to
think
of
it
you
look
like
that
boy
oh
no
sir
it
was
i
said
billy
frightened
i
i
only
just
come
well
maybe
not
goodness
knows
though
you
ugly
enough
where
are
you
going
illustration
now
do
give
me
any
of
your
tomato
page
i
taking
a
message
to
bogie
man
sir
and
and
i
really
must
go
at
once
good
bye
oh
ho
so
you
the
boy
bumbus
warned
me
about
last
night
i
guess
you
have
to
stay
here
said
the
tomato
threateningly
this
made
billy
angry
i
guess
not
he
said
and
gave
a
great
jump
into
the
air
not
so
fast
rubber
ball
not
so
fast
said
the
tomato
in
ear
and
though
billy
was
many
many
feet
away
from
the
ground
tomato
vines
had
grown
right
up
to
him
while
one
of
his
tendrils
had
wound
itself
about
his
feet
not
only
that
but
hundreds
of
other
tomatoes
not
quite
so
large
as
the
first
one
it
is
true
but
large
enough
to
frighten
billy
were
shaking
their
heads
at
him
threateningly
but
billy
plucked
up
his
courage
and
said
in
a
voice
that
was
a
wee
bit
shaky
come
now
do
give
me
any
of
your
tomato
sauce
if
not
careful
i
squash
you
even
then
i
be
some
pumpkins
shouted
the
tomato
nearly
bursting
with
rage
and
as
everybody
knows
a
well
red
tomato
is
not
a
greeny
i
certainly
should
be
able
to
catsup
with
a
small
boy
you
ought
to
go
on
the
stage
said
billy
trying
to
smile
you
really
are
very
funny
this
seemed
to
mollify
the
tomato
some
of
my
family
have
gone
on
as
soupers
what
would
you
suggest
for
me
comedy
or
tragedy
comedy
by
all
means
answered
billy
settling
himself
more
comfortably
on
a
large
leaf
because
of
course
having
stopped
moving
he
would
have
fallen
had
he
had
nothing
to
support
him
i
can
recite
said
the
tomato
do
you
want
to
hear
me
i
be
delighted
only
you
know
i
late
and
you
will
be
the
late
lamented
if
you
do
sit
tight
my
boy
said
the
tomato
sourly
listen
tomato
recitation
there
lived
a
wicked
wenket
once
who
kept
a
castle
keep
and
when
he
was
wide
awake
you
find
him
fast
asleep
he
ate
his
food
with
knife
and
fork
and
i
am
loath
to
state
he
wore
a
shoe
upon
each
foot
a
hat
upon
his
pate
of
course
it
hard
to
give
belief
so
sinful
one
could
be
but
oft
he
wore
a
collar
too
betwixt
just
you
and
me
and
think
of
this
i
blush
with
shame
to
tell
this
awful
truth
he
wore
a
coat
and
vest
and
pants
how
horribly
uncouth
but
wickedness
get
its
due
as
sure
as
corn
is
corn
he
went
to
bed
one
stormy
night
and
got
up
in
the
morn
now
little
boys
and
little
girls
this
tale
a
moral
bears
do
strike
the
baby
with
an
axe
or
throw
the
cat
down
stairs
good
said
billy
it
really
must
be
very
funny
indeed
when
it
is
well
done
and
pop
he
had
jumped
on
tomato
head
given
a
quick
spring
and
had
sailed
off
before
tomato
realized
what
he
was
up
to
i
glad
tomato
recited
he
was
so
out
of
breath
when
he
finished
that
he
could
grow
after
me
said
billy
to
himself
when
he
saw
that
he
was
safe
from
pursuit
i
wonder
what
honey
girl
is
doing
today
and
i
fear
that
he
was
still
thinking
so
hard
about
honey
girl
that
he
forgot
to
notice
when
he
next
dropped
to
the
ground
anyway
he
was
standing
deep
in
thought
when
something
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
salute
said
a
stern
voice
looking
up
billy
saw
that
he
was
surrounded
by
hundreds
of
soldiers
dressed
in
uniforms
of
the
very
deepest
indigo
and
all
wearing
blue
glasses
and
such
a
thin
sad
officer
as
had
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
billy
could
tell
he
was
an
officer
because
of
the
gun
metal
sword
he
carried
and
the
epaulettes
of
crepe
that
he
wore
salute
said
the
officer
again
in
a
deep
sepulcheral
tone
yes
sir
said
billy
cracking
his
heels
together
and
putting
his
hand
up
to
his
cap
as
he
had
seen
soldiers
do
that
not
the
proper
salute
take
out
your
handkerchief
and
wipe
your
right
eye
said
the
officer
that
the
proper
salute
for
the
blues
billy
did
as
he
was
told
with
a
sinking
heart
everything
seemed
so
changed
by
the
regiment
of
blues
the
sun
had
gone
under
a
cloud
the
wind
whistled
dismally
a
frog
croaked
in
a
nearby
pond
and
all
together
billy
came
near
to
wanting
to
use
his
handkerchief
in
earnest
so
you
think
you
are
going
to
see
bogie
man
yes
sir
i
am
you
not
as
sure
as
my
name
is
colonel
solemncholly
excuse
me
but
i
am
said
billy
staunchly
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
said
the
colonel
sadly
he
is
too
fat
to
give
up
easily
goodness
how
i
hate
fat
people
they
laugh
do
you
ever
laugh
sir
i
be
court
martialed
if
i
did
but
are
you
commander
asked
billy
illustration
yes
of
the
blues
but
you
know
we
the
guard
of
bogie
man
and
he
is
our
real
commander
oh
i
see
then
you
can
tell
me
how
to
get
to
never
was
indeed
not
we
were
sent
out
to
stop
you
and
that
reminds
me
corporal
punishment
and
private
tear
seize
this
boy
snap
went
the
whip
in
corporal
punishment
hand
crack
it
struck
private
tear
on
the
shoulder
and
snuffing
and
wiping
his
eyes
private
tear
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
seize
him
and
throw
him
in
the
dumps
cried
colonel
solemncholly
as
the
colonel
spoke
the
drums
gave
a
long
dismal
roll
and
the
band
struck
up
a
funeral
march
corporal
punishment
whip
was
circling
in
the
air
preparatory
to
coming
down
on
billy
head
and
private
tear
was
getting
ready
to
put
his
handkerchief
over
his
eyes
when
billy
laughed
it
was
because
he
felt
like
laughing
at
all
but
because
barker
in
snuggling
closer
to
him
had
tickled
him
in
the
ribs
look
out
he
armed
cried
colonel
solemncholly
corporal
punishment
and
private
tear
in
one
breath
this
gave
billy
an
idea
and
he
burst
out
into
a
loud
laugh
throw
a
wet
blanket
over
him
commanded
the
colonel
regiment
carry
arms
at
that
the
soldiers
drew
out
their
held
them
to
their
eyes
reversed
their
guns
and
advanced
boldly
on
billy
while
the
band
played
the
tune
the
old
cow
died
on
billy
continued
to
force
his
laugh
trying
hard
to
think
of
some
way
out
of
his
difficulty
he
did
like
the
idea
of
the
wet
blanket
and
he
could
jump
or
run
because
corporal
punishment
whip
was
wound
around
his
neck
double
quick
cried
the
colonel
catch
him
before
the
sun
comes
out
barker
stirred
uneasily
in
billy
pocket
saved
cried
billy
it
worth
trying
and
quickly
taking
barker
out
of
his
pocket
he
held
him
by
his
hind
legs
and
gently
thumped
his
little
stomach
plump
and
out
fell
the
bar
of
sunlight
he
had
swallowed
the
night
before
when
it
struck
the
ground
it
burst
into
a
million
dancing
sparkling
bits
of
golden
sunshine
and
presto
the
blues
had
disappeared
lock
stock
and
barrel
and
there
stood
billy
in
a
glow
of
sunlight
on
the
beautiful
green
grass
listening
to
the
sweet
notes
of
forest
birds
in
the
trees
nearby
now
i
know
how
to
get
rid
of
the
blues
sang
billy
to
himself
as
he
leapt
into
the
air
a
good
hearty
laugh
and
a
bit
of
sunshine
will
always
disperse
them
chapter
iv
adventures
in
hello
cried
billy
what
that
ahead
far
off
on
the
horizon
he
saw
a
large
white
and
gold
thing
sailing
through
the
air
as
he
drew
nearer
he
could
see
its
wings
gently
flapping
it
looks
something
like
why
it
a
large
fried
egg
said
he
excitedly
good
day
sir
for
by
this
time
they
were
side
by
side
it
not
a
good
day
and
i
not
sir
i
white
wings
said
the
fried
egg
curling
up
around
the
edges
scornfully
well
maybe
you
not
sir
said
billy
tartly
but
you
very
surly
you
would
blame
me
if
you
knew
how
nearly
i
jumped
out
of
the
into
the
fire
this
morning
you
can
see
that
i
all
of
still
and
all
because
bogie
man
sent
an
airless
message
to
the
blue
hen
chicken
that
i
was
to
get
up
before
breakfast
and
do
sentry
duty
what
for
asked
billy
to
stop
one
billy
bounce
alias
rubber
ball
boy
and
take
him
prisoner
to
the
town
of
he
a
very
dangerous
person
why
i
and
then
billy
stopped
of
course
you
are
i
knew
that
as
soon
as
i
saw
you
said
white
wings
complacently
what
did
you
know
that
you
am
i
i
do
know
but
you
said
you
were
said
white
wings
but
wait
a
minute
i
have
a
lineless
picture
of
this
billy
bounce
some
place
about
me
you
need
trouble
said
billy
i
billy
bounce
yes
i
know
answered
white
wings
unblushingly
it
impossible
to
deceive
well
was
all
billy
could
say
so
disgusted
was
he
with
the
barefaced
fib
and
here
we
are
said
the
egg
as
they
dropped
gently
on
the
sidewalk
in
the
town
of
and
such
a
grotesque
town
as
it
was
not
a
straight
street
or
house
in
it
the
walls
a
little
distance
away
went
up
and
up
so
high
that
billy
could
just
barely
see
the
roofs
of
the
houses
but
when
he
was
standing
next
them
he
could
almost
reach
their
tops
by
standing
on
tiptoe
the
streets
looked
miles
long
but
he
knew
he
could
almost
come
to
their
end
in
three
steps
and
a
jump
what
an
exaggeration
said
billy
to
himself
why
of
course
the
reason
they
call
it
here
billy
bounce
called
white
wings
and
out
of
their
doors
and
windows
trooped
the
inhabitants
first
came
the
blue
hen
chicken
and
after
her
rolled
eggs
of
all
kinds
and
descriptions
illustration
hen
my
goodness
said
white
wings
what
a
time
i
had
with
him
to
be
sure
it
was
only
after
a
fierce
struggle
that
i
succeeded
in
capturing
him
why
exclaimed
billy
in
surprise
i
is
he
very
strong
interrupted
the
blue
hen
chicken
strong
said
white
wings
i
should
say
he
was
much
stronger
than
our
oldest
inhabitant
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
me
asked
billy
too
disgusted
to
deny
the
story
wait
and
see
chuckled
the
chicken
wait
wait
wait
wait
and
see
bad
luck
bad
luck
bad
luck
serve
him
right
for
being
a
greedy
boy
said
turkey
egg
angrily
i
know
him
he
a
bad
lot
always
eating
just
gobble
gobble
gobble
all
day
long
that
not
true
said
billy
you
know
you
do
know
me

saw
you
in
my
life
before
whispered
turkey
egg
but
mention
that

i
want
to
get
my
witness
fee

got
to
say
something

i
but
you
may
be
swearing

billy
i
never

but
i
sure

to
get
away
do
you
yes
of
course
well
you
want
to
take
your
life

not
here
you
wo
be
here
and
if
you
are
not
here
you
will
be
away
and
turkey
egg
laughed
heartily
at
his
joke
you
are
the
most
heartless
egg
i
ever
knew
said
billy
in
despair
now
you
hit
the
truth
said
turkey
egg
confidentially
years
ago
when
they
thought
i
was
going
to
turn
out
bad
they
blew
my
heart
out
is
he
handsome
simpered
little
miss
easter
egg
coloring
up
billy
pretended
not
to
hear
this
but
it
did
his
heart
good
to
know
that
he
had
one
friend
in
the
city
in
the
meantime
blue
hen
chicken
and
the
official
candler
who
was
called
egg
judge
had
been
discussing
what
should
be
done
with
billy
bogie
man
says
he
is
to
be
kept
in
custardy
for
a
thousand
years
said
blue
hen
chicken
illustration
miss
easter
i
know
that
an
exaggeration
said
billy
why
i
ca
live
that
long
of
course
not
answered
the
official
candler
and
if
you
not
alive
what
difference
will
it
make
whether
it
a
thousand
years
or
ten
thousand
come
come
we
wasting
time
fussed
the
blue
hen
chicken
to
the
packing
house
jail
with
him
i
stick
to
him
cried
al
bumen
the
policeman
shaking
his
at
billy
fiercely
come
along
now
there
no
use
trying
to
resist
for
i
have
you
where
i
want
you
and
billy
seeing
that
it
was
indeed
useless
to
try
to
escape
as
things
then
were
went
sulkily
off
with
al
bumen
moist
hand
in
his
collar
please
take
your
sticky
fingers
off
of
my
neck
said
he
i
wo
try
to
run
you
promise
asked
al
bumen
i
do
cross
my
heart
and
hope
to
die
said
billy
eagerly
well
i
do
believe
you
i
ca
believe
any
body
in
poor
billy
hung
his
head
in
shame
as
he
was
led
along
the
street
like
a
common
criminal
he
tried
two
or
three
times
to
pull
away
but
al
bumen
arm
would
stretch
out
like
a
rubber
band
and
then
snap
billy
would
bounce
back
like
a
return
ball
there
now
what
did
i
tell
you
said
al
bumen
that
the
second
time
that
you
have
tried
to
escape
and
you
said
you
would
but
you
would
take
my
word
of
course
not
i
have
no
use
for
your
word
i
have
plenty
of
my
own
and
anyway
how
could
you
keep
your
word
if
you
gave
it
to
me
my
my
my
what
a
day
it
was
for
the
inhabitants
of
they
had
seen
eggs
beaten
and
taken
up
by
the
police
but
never
a
boy
the
scramble
egg
children
tumbled
along
at
billy
side
shouting
and
rolling
over
and
over
in
their
glee
mothers
brought
their
little
cradled
egg
babies
out
to
see
him
pass
even
poor
addle
the
village
egg
idiot
made
faces
at
him
only
billy
felt
sorry
for
him
because
he
could
see
that
he
was
cracked
but
when
some
of
the
bad
little
street
boys
threw
stones
at
him
even
al
bumen
was
angry
indeed
they
barely
missed
his
head
two
or
three
times
stop
it
he
cried
i
know
you
every
one
you
are
the
strictly
boys
how
do
you
know
them
asked
billy
for
they
looked
like
any
other
eggs
to
him
do
you
think
i
ca
recognize
a
fresh
egg
when
i
see
him
oh
i
know
them
their
mother
thinks
because
they
have
had
their
names
in
the
grocer
window
that
they
ca
turn
out
bad
but
i
known
some
terrible
ones
in
that
family
billy
felt
almost
relieved
when
they
reached
the
jail
in
with
you
said
al
bumen
by
the
way
have
you
ever
had
the
chicken
pox
no
sir
said
billy
well
you
must
be
vaccinated
at
once
i
would
have
you
catch
it
and
break
out
now
that
you
are
safely
here
i
warn
you
i
shall
try
to
said
billy
in
a
temper
i
give
you
leave
to
try
but
it
useless
to
try
to
leave
you
can
thank
your
lucky
stars
you
were
put
in
the
incubator
instead
of
in
here
the
incubator
asked
billy
yes
the
orphan
asylum
it
a
terribly
hot
place
an
egg
that
goes
in
there
never
comes
out
the
same
said
al
bumen
gravely
oh
i
know
said
billy
it
changes
them
into
chicks
yes
it
capital
punishment
they
either
come
out
entirely
bad
or
with
fowl
natures
it
enough
to
make
one
to
think
of
it
billy
was
shown
into
his
cell
and
the
door
was
locked
why
who
are
you
said
he
in
surprise
for
when
his
eyes
got
used
to
the
darkness
he
discovered
that
he
had
a
cell
mate
a
egg
yawned
and
sat
up
on
the
cot
he
had
been
lying
on
me
i
boiled
egg
what
what
have
you
done
sir
said
billy
hoping
it
was
murder
that
the
trouble
said
boiled
egg
sulkily
i
overdone
got
into
hot
water
last
night
and
they
arrested
me
for
a
hard
character
this
morning
i
believe
the
charge
is
salt
and
peppery
that
too
bad
said
billy
sympathetically
it
is
that
but
they
better
look
out
or
i
turn
into
an
easter
egg
and
dye
on
their
hands
said
he
fiercely
tap
tap
tap
came
from
the
wall
what
that
asked
billy
oh
a
couple
of
softies
in
the
next
cell
who
are
they
the
poachers
ham
omelet
found
them
trapping
a
rasher
of
bacon
on
his
property
and
had
them
arrested
they
been
put
on
toast
and
water
for
punishment
by
the
way
do
you
know
what
they
have
done
with

billy

under
the
singing
tree
time
for
supper
is
it
mr
tree
he
said
i
as
hungry
as
a
wolf
immediately
the
tree
commenced
to
sing
pease
porridge
hot
pease
porridge
cold
pease
porridge
in
the
pot
nine
days
old
and
with
a
rustle
of
leaves
it
handed
down
three
kinds
of
porridge
billy
chose
some
of
the
hot
pease
porridge
and
found
it
very
good
then
it
sang
little
fishey
in
the
brook
papa
caught
it
with
a
hook
mamma
fried
it
in
a
pan
and
billy
ate
it
like
a
man
at
the
same
time
handing
him
a
sizzling
hot
fish
on
a
clean
white
platter
the
fish
was
done
to
a
turn
and
it
no
wonder
billy
left
nothing
but
the
bones
next
came
pat
a
cake
pat
a
cake
baker
man
so
i
will

as
fast
as

b
put
in
the
oven
for
billy
and
me
there
said
billy
when
that
was
finished
i
feel
as
though
i
had
almost
enough
but
a
little
pie
would
and
sure
enough
the
tree
sang
little
jack
horner
sat
in
a
corner
eating
a
xmas
pie
he
put
in
his
thumb
and
he
took
out
a
plum
and
said
what
a
good
boy
am
i
of
course
one
plum
was
gone
because
jack
horner
had
taken
that
but
there
were
plenty
more
left
and
billy
ate
to
his
heart
content
so
it
was
every
night
and
billy
never
wanted
for
plenty
to
eat
but
this
night
he
had
had
such
a
hearty
meal
that
i
fear
it
made
him
a
bit
restless
in
his
sleep
at
any
rate
some
time
in
the
middle
of
the
night
he
was
awakened
by
a
voice
calling
umberufen
and
a
tiny
hand
thumping
him
on
the
chest
asked
billy
sleepily
umberufen
said
the
voice
oh
said
billy
sitting
up
suddenly
and
upsetting
a
little
old
man
with
wooden
pajamas
and
a
face
who
umberufen
i
am
and
you
called
me
out
of
a
sound
sleep
i
do
think
you
mortals
are
the
most
inconsiderate
people
i
ever
met
said
umberufen
angrily
now
what
do
you
want
tell
me
quickly
because
i
want
to
get
back
to
my
sawdust
bed
illustration
never
wanted
for
plenty
to
page
i
did
call
you
i
been
asleep
myself
you
did
there
no
use
trying
to
deceive
me
i
distinctly
felt
it
when
you
touched
wood
why
pointing
at
billy
hand
which
rested
on
the
trunk
of
the
singing
tree
you
still
touching
wood
now
tell
me
you
did
call
me
illustration
what
has
my
touching
wood
to
do
with
you
asked
billy
it
calls
me
to
you
worse
luck
what
a
dull
fat
boy
you
are
to
be
sure
said
umberufen
scornfully
how
was
i
to
know
not
made
any
arrangement
with
you
sure
well
if
you
did
your
fairy
godfather
did
and
got
me
dirt
cheap
at
that
ten
cents
a
day
and
traveling
expenses
but
speak
up
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
said
billy
crossly
but
you
were
asleep
replied
umberufen
yes
i
was
then
if
you
were
asleep
why
did
you
call
me
to
tell
me
you
wanted
to
go
to
sleep
it
was
an
accident
said
billy
i
did
want
you
do
want
you
and
if
you
ca
do
anything
but
scold
a
fellow
because
you
came
when
you
were
wanted
i
do
ever
want
to
see
you
again
and
billy
turned
over
in
a
huff
and
closed
his
eyes
but
i
ca
go
until
i
do
something
for
are
my
orders
said
umberufen
sulkily
you
called
me
here
and
you
got
to
abide
by
the
consequences
i
do
care
what
you
do
well
then
stand
on
your
head
said
billy
zip
and
there
stood
little
old
umberufen
on
his
head
why
you
say
so
sooner
said
he
as
he
regained
his
feet
i
have
been
home
by
this
time
and
he
was
gone
when
billy
woke
in
the
morning
he
felt
just
a
bit
sleepy
and
cross
but
after
he
and
barker
had
had
a
game
of
romps
he
felt
better
and
tucking
the
dog
under
his
arm
he
jumped
off
into
space
singing
gaily
my
gracious
what
a
big
sea
shore
this
is
exclaimed
billy
when
he
drifted
down
to
earth
again
and
how
hot
the
sun
is
but
where
is
the
water
and
billy
stood
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
brow
while
barker
squirmed
out
of
his
arms
and
stood
in
billy
shadow
with
his
tongue
lolling
out
it
seems
to
me
the
singing
tree
can
help
us
here
said
billy
barker
undoubtedly
understood
him
and
thought
it
a
splendid
plan
for
quick
as
a
flash
his
little
fore
paws
had
dug
a
hole
in
the
soft
sand
he
barked
into
it
kicked
the
sand
in
again
with
his
hind
legs
and
he
and
billy
were
soon
sitting
in
the
grateful
shade
of
the
tree
said
billy
this
is
what
i
call
comfort
comfort
said
a
voice
on
the
other
side
of
the
tree
much
you
know
about
comfort
the
voice
was
followed
by
the
mortal
that
billy
had
ever
beheld
a
regular
head
large
at
the
jaws
and
small
at
the
top
scrawny
neck
sloping
shoulders
and
skinny
legs
and
such
a
face
weeping
beady
eyes
a
long
sharp
nose
and
thin
lips
turned
down
at
the
corners
who
are
you
asked
billy
sharply
and
what
do
you
mean
by
coming
up
so
suddenly
illustration
i
a
hermit
and
this
is
my
fast
day
so
i
could
come
slowly
said
the
man
sadly
what
is
a
fast
day
asked
billy
a
day
when
you
do
eat
oh
said
billy
i
thought
you
meant
a
day
when
time
flies
no
said
the
man
wrapping
his
legs
around
and
around
each
other
no
if
that
were
the
case
every
day
would
be
a
fast
day
because
always
fly
time
in
this
desert
you
seem
unhappy
cheer
up
i
ca
cheer
up
how
is
a
fellow
to
cheer
when
he
ca
speak
above
a
whisper
i
mean
laugh
said
billy
laugh
said
the
man
wearily
what
that
do
you
know
what
a
laugh
is
cried
billy
in
surprise
why
this
is
a
laugh
i
do
see
any
sense
in
that
said
the
hermit
that
just
a
noise
of
course
it
a
noise
come
now
i
tell
you
a
joke
when
is
a
door
not
a
door
of
course
it
was
very
very
old
but
so
was
the
hermit
and
billy
wanted
to
start
with
the
simplest
joke
he
could
think
of
quite
impossible
no
when
it
is
that
a
good
one
said
billy
oh
my
oh
me
what
a
terrible
thing
cried
the
man
bursting
into
tears
suppose
all
the
doors
should
be
changed
into
jars
what
would
the
poor
people
do
but
do
you
see
that
the
joke
said
billy
means
partly
open
yes
but
if
it
were
still
a
door
how
could
it
be
a
jar
it
got
to
be
one
or
the
other
oh
pshaw
said
billy
in
disgust
ca
you
see
it
a
joke
i
think
it
very
funny
oh
is
that
funny
asked
the
hermit
of
course
then
that
the
reason
it
does
make
me
laugh
when
i
was
a
boy
i
broke
my
humerus
and
had
to
have
my
funny
bone
extracted
so
i
see
anything
funny
poor
fellow
said
billy
sympathetically
what
town
is
that
over
there
mirage
town
said
the
hermit
but
you
ca
reach
it
unless
you
fly
why
not
it
built
in
the
sky
in
the
sky
is
it
on
the
road
to
bogie
man
house
are
you
seeking
bogie
man
oh
me
oh
my
do
tell
me
you
are
seeking
him
but
i
am
said
billy
why
not
because
i
got
to
hold
you
if
you
are
and
i
so
tired
said
the
hermit
slowly
reaching
out
his
arms
cried
billy
giving
a
jump
and
bounding
out
of
his
reach
oh
please
come
back
and
tell
me
another
joke
i
have
had
a
good
cry
for
a
week
called
the
hermit
holding
out
his
arms
too
late
billy
called
back
but
when
is
a
door
not
a
door
when
its
a
jar
thank
you
sobbed
the
hermit
and
the
last
billy
saw
or
heard
of
him
he
was
murmuring
when
is
a
door
a
jar
and
weeping
bitterly
in
a
twinkling
billy
stood
at
the
gates
of
mirage
town
far
beneath
him
he
could
see
the
burning
hot
desert
while
through
the
gates
he
could
see
cool
airy
houses
beautiful
streets
shaded
by
great
trees
and
far
beyond
soft
green
meadows
and
sparkling
brooks
my
goodness
but
i
thirsty
said
billy
to
himself
i
wish
the
gate
keeper
would
hurry
and
let
me
in
and
again
and
again
he
knocked
but
seemingly
with
no
result
finally
when
his
throat
was
parched
and
his
tongue
dry
with
thirst
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
he
put
his
shoulder
to
the
gates
open
they
swung
and
billy
fell
inside
on
his
face
why
it
was
just
like
pushing
clouds
away
he
exclaimed
but
i
in
the
sun
here
i
must
cross
to
the
other
side
so
across
the
street
he
ran
why
this
is
strange
i
was
sure
this
was
the
shady
side
he
said
in
surprise
for
when
he
got
there
the
sun
if
anything
was
hotter
than
ever
and
the
side
he
had
left
was
cool
shady
and
inviting
billy
shut
his
eyes
i
afraid
this
is
he
said
anyway
i
try
again
and
back
he
ran
as
hard
as
he
could
go
but
when
he
got
across
it
was
the
same
thing
as
before
come
in
and
rest
called
a
voice
from
a
house
at
his
side
you
look
hot
and
tired
come
in
and
rest
your
face
and
hands
thank
you
i
will
said
billy
gratefully
not
noticing
that
the
voice
was
just
a
wee
bit
derisive
this
way
called
the
voice
turn
the
knob
and
walk
in
if
you
can
oh
i
can
said
billy
walking
toward
the
door
of
the
house
he
thought
he
heard
the
voice
coming
from
not
that
way
i
across
the
street
called
the
voice
oh
said
billy
politely
starting
across
again
i
beg
your
pardon
i
thought
think
again
said
the
voice
are
you
coming
in
or
not
i
not
over
here
i
over
there
where
back
where
you
coming
from
i
thought
you
said
began
billy
it
does
make
any
difference
what
i
said
i
did
say
it
answered
the
voice
billy
began
to
lose
his
temper
are
you
making
fun
of
me
who
are
you
anyway
i
nothing
divided
by
two
why
that
nothing
said
billy
wrong
answered
the
voice
why
do
ask
so
many
questions
are
you
coming
in
or
not
i
think
not
said
billy
i
ca
spare
the
time
i
suppose
you
think
you
have
to
get
right
on
to
bogie
man
house
yes
but
you
not
you
never
get
away
from
mirage
town
why
not
asked
billy
because
there
is
no
such
place
but
i
here
that
the
trouble
you
are
in
a
town
that
does
exist
so
of
course
you
are
not
in
any
place
and
if
you
tell
me
how
you
can
leave
a
place
where
you
not
i
i
show
you
said
billy
angrily
i
jump
out
and
he
tried
to
jump
no
use
said
the
voice
laughing
there
nothing
under
your
feet
and
you
ca
jump
from
nothing
well
i
get
a
drink
of
water
from
that
brook
and
then
you
see
said
billy
i
go
out
by
the
gate
i
entered
ha
ha
ha
laughed
the
voice
try
and
see
nothing
daunted
however
billy
ran
toward
the
brook
ca
catch
me
ca
catch
me
called
the
brook
running
boys
ca
catch
running
brooks
indeed
i
will
and
sure
enough
after
a
long
hard
run
billy
reached
the
brook
now
said
he
exultingly
now
i
got
you
dipping
his
cap
deep
into
the
water
he
eagerly
lifted
it
to
his
lips
and
found
it
empty
while
far
off
down
the
road
ran
the
brook
billy
came
very
near
crying
he
was
so
hot
and
thirsty
and
disappointed
but
he
swallowed
the
lump
in
his
throat
which
being
salty
made
him
thirstier
than
ever
and
turned
back
again
the
gates
are
all
that
left
he
said
bravely
and
i
catch
them
i
sure
but
it
was
to
be
for
the
farther
and
the
harder
he
ran
the
farther
off
the
gates
were
and
finally
he
sank
down
entirely
out
of
breath
no
water
no
shade
no
trees
why
the
singing
tree
of
course
he
cried
delightedly
out
jumped
barker
scratch
scratch
scratch
and
bing
the
topmost
branches
of
the
singing
tree
popped
up
and
almost
struck
billy
in
the
face
hello
cried
billy
where
are
your
roots
i
do
see
anything
but
branches
two
miles
below
where
they
ought
to
grow
sang
the
tree
come
hold
on
tight
you
be
all
right
and
billy
seized
the
branch
that
held
itself
out
to
him
hold
on
there
i
want
to
speak
to
you
called
the
voice
that
had
teased
him
so
i
hold
on
called
billy
but
i
soon
be
out
of
your
hearing
down
grew
the
tree
shorter
and
shorter
it
grew
and
sure
enough
in
a
minute
billy
was
on
solid
ground
and
mirage
town
had
disappeared
from
view
chapter
vi
blind
man
buff
billy
made
an
early
start
the
next
morning
so
that
he
could
get
away
from
the
desert
before
the
sun
rose
to
its
full
height
and
indeed
the
pink
had
just
begun
to
appear
in
the
east
when
he
looked
below
him
and
saw
once
more
trees
and
grass
and
streams
of
water
thank
goodness
i
am
clear
of
the
burning
desert
at
last
he
said
to
himself
ugh
though
here
i
am
falling
and
i
know
i
be
drenched
passing
through
that
cloud
plump
squash
and
he
was
in
the
cloud
there
it
was
so
bad
after
all
why
there
honey
girl
palanquin
sure
enough
he
had
alighted
within
a
few
feet
of
honey
girl
general
merchandise
and
the
bee
soldiers
all
sound
asleep
who
o
who
o
who
o
goes
there
cried
a
large
owl
perched
on
the
limb
of
a
tree
above
the
sleepers
heads
i
not
going
i
coming
said
billy
who
o
o
who
o
o
who
o
o
are
you
billy
bounce
that
not
the
right
answer
cried
general
merchandise
jumping
to
his
feet
you
must
say
a
friend
a
friend
then
answered
billy
not
a
friend
then
or
now
just
say
a
friend
said
the
general
a
friend
that
right
advance
and
give
the
the
what
asked
billy
the
counter
sign
i
mean
i
do
know
it
well
i
suppose
i
have
to
tell
you
seeing
it
you
it
bogie
man
said
the
general
bogie
man
repeated
billy
there
that
all
over
now
you
may
sit
down
thank
you
but
but
what
has
happened
to
the
soldiers
they
seem
to
have
lost
their
arms
have
you
had
a
battle
oh
no
answered
the
general
proudly
that
my
own
idea
read
of
soldiers
before
a
battle
sleeping
on
their
arms
have
you
yes
well
every
night
our
soldiers
take
off
their
arms
and
sleep
on
them
of
course
it
was
a
little
uncomfortable
at
first
but
it
very
military
yes
i
suppose
so
said
billy
dubiously
but
who
is
that
a
gentleman
up
in
the
tree
you
mean
the
owl
i
thought
he
looked
like
an
owl
that
our
sentry
he
does
it
very
cheap
by
the
night
because
he
says
he
has
to
stay
awake
anyway
and
he
might
as
well
stay
awake
here
and
get
paid
for
it
answered
the
general
how
is
princess
honey
girl
well
very
well
in
fact
but
a
little
nervous
you
see
bumbus
and
the
scally
wags
are
on
our
trail
and
she
feels
uneasy
bumbus
cried
billy
yes
he
is
a
renegade
bee
you
know
and
it
makes
him
very
bitter
against
the
princess
you
have
seen
anything
of
them
lately
have
you
no
i
have
not
but
who
are
the
scally
wags
oh
they
terrible
fellows
i
ca
tell
you
what
they
look
like
for
i
never
seen
them
but
many
a
time
i
read
of
their
doings
in
morning
bee
good
morning
billy
bounce
said
honey
girl
opening
the
curtains
of
her
palanquin
general
is
it
time
to
sound
the
reveille
illustration
bee
exactly
we
must
get
our
soldiers
up
said
the
general
saluting
up
jumped
a
little
bee
saluted
plucked
a
trumpet
flower
and
gave
the
reveille
i
ca
get
up
i
ca
get
up
i
ca
get
up
in
the
morning
the
corporal
worse
than
the
private
the
sergeant
worse
than
the
corporal
the
lieutenant
worse
than
the
sergeant
and
the
captain
worse
than
them
all
and
in
a
second
the
whole
camp
was
buzzing
with
soldiers
there
how
that
said
the
general
proudly
splendid
said
billy
then
turning
to
the
princess
i
have
thought
of
you
many
many
times
since
i
last
saw
you
princess
honey
girl
and
i
have
thought
of
you
billy
bounce
perhaps
some
day
when
this
cruel
war
is
over
you
can
visit
my
aunt
and
myself
in
the
bee
palace
said
the
princess
perhaps
said
billy
and
i
do
believe
that
time
is
far
distant
for
when
i
once
find
bogie
man
i
shall
there
they
are
there
they
are
called
a
voice
and
looking
up
and
away
to
the
east
billy
saw
bumbus
and
several
objects
that
he
knew
at
once
for
scally
wags
princess
you
must
leave
at
once
he
cried
right
again
said
the
general
we
can
outfly
them
company
fix
stings
carry
palanquin
forward
fly
and
up
and
off
went
the
whole
company
the
princess
waving
to
billy
indeed
he
was
so
intent
on
watching
her
and
waving
to
her
that
when
he
did
come
to
himself
and
realized
that
it
was
time
he
got
away
it
was
too
late
here
billy
bounce
cried
bumbus
settling
down
at
his
side
oh
what
a
joke
cried
the
scally
wags
in
one
voice
tweaking
his
nose
and
his
ears
and
pinching
his
legs
and
though
the
tweaks
and
the
pinches
hurt
billy
could
help
laughing
at
the
funny
little
figures
such
great
flapping
ears
such
wide
slits
of
mouths
set
in
a
continual
grin
such
long
arms
such
round
funny
little
stomachs
and
such
gay
clothes
well
boy
said
bumbus
poking
him
in
the
ribs
what
are
you
laughing
at
at
your
friends
the
scally
wags
said
billy
bite
him
on
the
wrist
cried
the
head
scally
wag
angrily
bite
me
laughed
billy
why
you
have
a
full
set
of
teeth
between
you
and
it
was
true
for
there
was
only
one
tooth
to
a
scally
wag
be
quiet
said
bumbus
i
thinking
where
that
note
nickel
plate
gave
you
billy
did
not
answer
did
you
hear
me
billy
nodded
yes
illustration
oh
what
a
joke
cried
the
scally
page
then
why
do
you
answer
come
speak
up
cried
bumbus
in
a
temper
i
thought
you
said
to
be
quiet
that
you
wanted
to
think
said
billy
looking
very
very
innocent
you
pay
for
this
said
bumbus
what
the
thought
asked
billy
you
should
sell
it
if
it
is
the
only
one
you
have
you
probably
need
it
some
time
was
all
that
bumbus
could
answer
he
was
so
angry
leave
him
to
me
said
the
head
scally
wag
i
joke
him
to
death
do
your
worst
said
bumbus
regaining
his
breath
no
i
do
my
best
here
a
conundrum
little
fat
boy
but
you
must
answer
it
correctly
why
not
said
billy
oh
that
against
the
rules
of
the
game
no
wag
not
even
a
scally
wag
expects
his
conundrums
to
be
answered
correctly
why
do
you
ask
me
then
so
that
i
can
laugh
at
you
for
not
knowing
the
answer
but
that
nonsense
persisted
billy
of
course
it
is
we
scally
wags
are
all
nonsense
well
go
ahead
what
time
will
it
be
this
time
last
week
you
must
say
will
it
be
but
was
it
have
you
ever
heard
this
conundrum
before
no
said
billy
well
you
see
i
have
it
my
conundrum
and
i
guess
know
what
i
ought
to
say
then
it
will
be
the
same
time
that
it
is
now
answered
billy
wrong
wrong
again
said
the
head
scally
wag
it
will
be
a
week
earlier
oh
what
a
joke
cried
the
scally
wags
again
tweaking
pinching
and
punching
billy
if
you
do
that
again
i
pitch
into
you
cried
billy
angrily
there
that
will
do
interrupted
bumbus
then
hummed
boys
delight
to
bark
and
bite
it
is
their
nature
to
but
every
cat
has
many
lives
and
thereby
hangs
a
tale
but
that
does
rhyme
said
billy
of
course
not
why
should
it
asked
bumbus
was
it
meant
for
a
poem
certainly
not
it
was
meant
for
the
truth
but
it
not
the
truth
i
did
say
it
was
the
truth
said
bumbus
you
just
said
it
was
meant
for
the
truth
said
billy
yes
for
the
truth
it
was
just
an
imitation
so
there
no
more
truth
than
poetry
in
it
it
my
turn
now
said
the
head
scally
wag
we
could
joke
him
to
death
so
lets
tickle
him
into
little
bits
oh
do
cried
billy
i
ticklish
so
much
the
better
said
bumbus
but
if
you
will
give
up
the
note
we
let
you
go
i
ca
do
that
said
billy
decidedly
i
got
to
carry
that
to
bogie
man
come
on
cried
the
scally
wags
and
they
swarmed
over
billy
digging
their
fingers
in
the
spots
where
he
should
have
been
ticklish
but
of
course
they
did
know
that
he
had
on
his
air
suit
and
the
more
they
tickled
the
more
serious
billy
looked
no
use
said
the
head
scally
wag
sinking
down
on
the
ground
exhausted
we
would
need
a
to
tickle
that
boy
give
him
laughing
gas
suggested
bumbus
just
the
thing
cried
the
scally
wags
wait
a
minute
said
billy
just
let
me
have
one
little
game
before
you
give
me
the
gas
as
a
last
request
asked
bumbus
yes
well
what
is
it
speak
quickly
for
time
is
short
and
life
is
long
you
know
i
want
to
play
a
game
of
blind
man
buff
said
billy
that
sounds
reasonable
said
bumbus
how
do
you
play
it
first
you
must
all
tie
your
handkerchiefs
over
your
eyes
ha
ha
he
he
ho
ho
oh
what
a
joke
cried
the
scally
wags
we
all
carry
pocket
handkerchiefs
and
then
said
bumbus
then
said
billy
you
all
try
to
catch
me
is
that
all
asked
bumbus
yes
what
fun
ha
ha
he
he
ho
ho
said
the
scally
wags
what
a
game
to
be
sure
billy
had
some
difficulty
tying
the
handkerchiefs
around
the
scally
wags
heads
on
account
of
their
enormous
ears
but
finally
they
were
all
blindfolded
bumbus
was
tied
up
in
a
jiffy
go
cried
billy
at
the
same
time
leaping
into
the
air
and
bumbus
and
the
scally
wags
all
made
a
rush
for
the
spot
where
he
had
stood
i
got
him
i
got
him
cried
all
the
scally
wags
hanging
on
to
bumbus
i
got
him
cried
bumbus
catching
hold
of
a
scally
wag
and
billy
laughed
aloud
to
see
them
scrambling
and
pushing
and
jostling
one
another
in
their
efforts
to
catch
him
even
when
he
was
just
a
moving
black
speck
on
the
horizon
bumbus
and
the
scally
wags
were
still
struggling
chapter
vii
the
wishing
bottle
i
ca
understand
why
bumbus
wanted
to
take
that
note
away
from
me
billy
said
to
himself
as
he
floated
along
first
he
and
nickel
plate
employed
me
to
carry
it
and
now
he
tries
to
hinder
me
why
of
course
i
know
he
is
aware
that
princess
honey
girl
has
told
me
her
story
and
fears
that
when
once
i
do
find
bogie
man
i
will
vanquish
him
so
i
shall
too
i
wonder
what
the
future
will
bring
wo
you
have
your
fortune
told
sir
and
billy
looked
up
to
see
sailing
along
at
his
side
a
very
old
very
withered
woman
sitting
on
a
broom
why
it
a
witch
said
billy
i
not
a
which
i
a
was
said
the
old
woman
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
said
billy
i
saw
that
you
were
riding
a
broom
well
what
of
it
the
broom
willing
i
did
mean
it
that
way
began
billy
oh
you
mean
you
meant
it
any
way
but
this
is
not
having
your
fortune
told
interrupted
the
old
woman
come
right
into
the
house
and
sure
enough
billy
discovered
that
he
was
standing
in
front
of
a
little
old
house
as
wrinkled
and
ugly
and
out
of
repair
as
the
old
woman
what
town
is
this
he
asked
superstitionburg
do
bump
into
the
ladder
what
is
that
for
oh
we
all
have
ladders
over
our
doors
here
for
bad
luck
sit
down
and
i
get
the
cards
and
tell
your
fortune
thank
you
said
billy
will
it
be
true
no
of
course
not
ah
h
you
have
lately
had
serious
trouble
that
true
said
billy
then
i
made
a
mistake
you
will
marry
a
tall
short
blonde
dark
complected
man
hold
on
said
billy
i
a
boy
how
can
i
marry
a
man
there
i
knew
something
was
wrong
i
have
the
deck
of
cards
that
i
tell
ladies
fortunes
with
shall
i
try
it
over
again
no
i
think
not
said
billy
i
must
be
going
and
a
great
black
cat
with
glaring
green
eyes
and
nine
long
black
tails
rubbed
against
his
leg
oh
he
cried
what
a
large
cat
yes
said
the
old
woman
that
my
black
tails
very
proud
of
him
he
the
unluckiest
cat
of
the
entire
thirteen
in
superstitionburg
unlucky
yes
the
cats
always
sit
thirteen
at
table
for
bad
luck
as
there
never
is
more
than
enough
for
twelve
and
as
he
always
gets
his
share
he
brings
bad
luck
to
one
of
the
cats
every
meal
is
that
nice
but
is
that
hard
on
the
extra
cat
oh
no
they
do
mind
at
all
it
so
good
for
the
digestion
wo
you
have
a
cup
of
poison
before
you
go
poison
said
billy
edging
toward
the
door
illustration
that
my
black
tails
said
the
old

luck
you
not
allowed

the
city
but
how
do
they
know
i
am
here
their
noses
are
itching
because
a
stranger
has
come
to
call
their
noses
are
very
sensitive
to
strangers
it
makes
them
such
careful
guards
have
they
guns
asked
billy
oh

they
all
have
guns
that
are
not
loaded
oh
well
then
they
ca
shoot
me
i
guess

know
much
about
guns
because
it
is
always
guns
that
are
not
loaded
that
shoot
people
that
so
i
had
forgotten
said
billy
but

you

a
witch

am
a
was
remember
i
mean
as
you
are
a
was
ca
you

me
i
can
lend
you
my
invisible
cloak
said
the
old
woman
going
to
a
closet
and
taking
nothing
out
of
it
here
it
is
handing
billy
nothing
at
all
very
carefully
but
where
is
it
asked
billy
i
just
gave
it
to
you
i
do
see
it
of
course
not
it
invisible
then
if
i
put
it
on
will
it
make
me
invisible
certainly
not
it
the
cloak
that
invisible
have
you
anything
else
asked
billy
yes
i
have
the
wishing
bottle
shall
i
be
able
to
see
that
oh
yes
here
it
is
why
that
hair
dye
it
says
on
the
label
do
speak
so
loud
that
all
it
is
but
you
see
it
turns
the
hair
so
black
that
it
almost
makes
it
invisible
it
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
but
do
tell
anyone
it
would
ruin
my
reputation
as
a
cuperess
a
cuperess
asked
billy
yes
i
cast
charms
what
kind
all
kinds
but
watch
charms
i
thought
that
was
a
sorceress
i
used
to
be
but
it
rude
to
drink
poison
out
of
a
saucer
now
and
so
i
am
a
cuperess
thank
you
very
much
for
the
wishing
bottle
said
billy
i
do
know
that
i
shall
need
it
but
i
take
it
anyway
bad
luck
to
you
called
the
old
woman
by
the
way
where
are
you
going
now
to
bogie
man
house
answered
billy
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
i
have
to
stop
him
if
i
only
had
been
a
was
i
might
have
guessed
this
was
the
boy
said
the
old
woman
wringing
her
hands
but
billy
did
hear
this
he
was
busy
examining
the
left
hind
foot
of
a
rabbit
displayed
in
a
shop
window
my
cats
cried
she
i
send
them
after
him
and
opening
an
inner
door
she
called
stingaree
stangaree
whollop
and
whim
mizzle
and
muzzle
luckety
limb
niddle
and
noddle
and
puzzlecat
too
roly
and
poly
i
need
all
of
you
as
each
name
was
called
out
ran
a
great
black
and
by
the
time
she
was
done
the
thirteen
of
them
were
standing
in
front
of
her
their
tails
swishing
back
and
forth
with
a
noise
like
a
hurricane
run
and
catch
that
boy
for
me
said
she
pointing
to
billy
and
off
they
scampered
what
a
wind
is
coming
up
said
billy
to
himself
when
he
heard
the
cats
behind
him
and
turning
round
he
saw
the
great
cats
bounding
after
him
they
after
me
i
sure
he
said
to
himself
but
i
can
jump
alas
for
billy
he
was
standing
under
a
ladder
when
he
spoke
and
when
he
jumped
bump
he
hit
his
head
on
the
topmost
rung
quick
as
a
flash
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
caught
the
ladder
and
there
he
hung
dangling
in
mid
air
with
thirteen
great
cats
meowing
and
spitting
and
yowling
on
the
ground
just
out
of
reach
of
his
feet
this
wo
do
they
will
climb
the
ladder
in
a
moment
the
wishing
bottle
maybe
i
can
blind
them
with
the
dye
holding
on
tight
with
one
hand
he
fished
the
bottle
out
of
his
pocket
if
i
only
had
something
to
turn
them
into
white
cats
he
said
staring
at
the
bottle
maybe
they
would
become
harmless
and
just
at
that
minute
a
thought
struck
him
so
hard
that
it
almost
knocked
loose
his
hold
on
the
ladder
this
is
black
dye
said
he
perhaps
if
i
reverse
the
label
it
will
become
white
dye
i
try
it
anyway
and
quick
as
thought
he
had
loosened
the
label
and
turned
it
upside
down
certain
it
is
that
the
contents
of
the
bottle
changed
to
a
on
the
instant
out
came
the
cork
blub
blub
gog
gurgle
splash
and
the
cats
were
drenched
with
the
liquid
pouf
and
where
billy
had
seen
thirteen
black
cats
appeared
thirteen
ones
the
cats
looked
at
one
another
in
astonishment
for
a
moment
and
then
forgetting
all
about
billy
began
to
flog
one
another
with
their
nine
tails
white
meow
flog
him
out
of
town
and
off
they
went
flogging
each
other
mercilessly
each
one
thinking
that
he
was
the
only
black
cat
in
the
whole
town
and
determined
to
beat
the
strangers
out
of
superstitionburg
there
some
good
in
hair
dye
after
all
laughed
billy
and
dropping
to
the
ground
he
stepped
from
under
the
ladder
leaped
into
the
air
and
bade
farewell
to
superstitionburg
for
ever
and
ever
chapter
viii
gammon
and
spinach
billy
did
know
how
long
he
had
been
sleeping
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
loud
galloping
who
in
the
world
can
be
riding
through
the
forest
so
fast
and
furiously
at
this
time
of
the
night
he
exclaimed
to
himself
i
hope
it
no
one
after
me
i
want
to
go
to
sleep
thunder
came
the
hoof
beats
nearer
and
nearer
clop
clop
clop
clap
clap
and
the
gallop
had
changed
into
a
trot
nearer
and
yet
nearer
came
the
sound
it
coming
here
sure
enough
i
must
get
up
and
meet
him
whoever
he
is
but
when
billy
tried
to
move
he
found
himself
bound
hand
and
foot
well
this
is
a
fine
he
said
after
vain
attempts
to
release
himself
said
a
little
voice
in
his
ear
who
are
you
asked
billy
in
surprise
i
really
like
to
tell
you
but
if
i
did
you
know
you
know
so
saying
a
little
figure
jumped
up
on
billy
chest
and
sat
there
with
his
face
all
screwed
up
as
if
he
were
making
fun
who
are
you
laughing
at
asked
billy
oh
what
a
good
spring
board
you
make
said
the
little
man
jumping
up
and
down
on
billy
chest
and
the
rubber
suit
did
make
a
fine
jumping
place
for
him
i
asked
you
a
question
said
billy
indignantly
that
not
my
fault
are
you
going
to
answer
me
give
it
up
try
me
with
another
said
the
little
man
another
what
asked
billy
another
question
of
course
and
if
i
ca
answer
that
you
owe
me
two
forfeits
by
the
way
how
many
does
that
make
what
two
forfeits
does
it
make
eight
feet
or
four
fore
feet
i
do
know
i
all
mixed
up
said
billy
how
many
well
seven
times
two
makes
does
it
yes
of
course
not
it
makes
fourteen
how
can
i
expect
you
to
understand
if
you
know
how
to
figure
well
well
here
night
mare
after
all
i
thought
she
was
never
coming
and
sure
enough
up
galloped
a
great
night
mare
now
some
people
say
that
night
mare
looks
just
exactly
like
a
horse
but
billy
knows
better
for
he
saw
this
one
very
very
plainly
her
body
was
made
of
a
long
hard
bolster
her
legs
of
the
four
posts
of
a
bedstead
her
neck
was
a
pillow
her
head
a
piano
stool
her
eyes
were
two
night
lamps
and
her
tail
was
mosquito
netting
here
billy
bounce
called
a
chorus
of
voices
from
her
back
and
down
scrambled
a
cabbage
a
carrot
a
plum
pudding
a
mince
pie
a
welch
rabbit
a
pot
of
jam
and
goodness
knows
how
many
other
things
that
little
boys
should
not
eat
is
gammon

a
voice

the
little
man
on

the
night
mare
plaintively

little
horse

said
gammon
when
we
through
you
can
take

the
night
mare
sulkily
now

gammon

from

and
leave

said
the
mare
wiping
an
oil
tear
from
her
eye
come
on
everyone
called
gammon
but
wait

minute
said
billy
who
are
you
you
look
like
good
things
to
eat
who
are
we
we
bad
things
to
eat
and
joining
hands
in
a
circle
about
billy
they
began
to
dance
and
sing
the
song
of
the
dream
food
sprites
cream

scream
food
we
are
the
things
for
dream
food

are
made
of
and
as
they
sang
fill
the
tummy
of
one
small
boy
they
dropped
hands
formed
a
long
line
and
one
by
one
leaped
on
to
billy
stomach
bounded
into
the
air
turned
a
double
somersault
and
landed
laughing
and
shouting
on
the
ground
on
the
other
side
for
all
the
world
like
acrobats
in
the
circus
please
let
me
try
said
night
mare
i
promise
not
to
run
away
oh
no
no
no
cried
billy
night
mare
will
kill
me
that
a
good
idea
said
gammon
shall
we
not
yet
answered
spinach
i
want
to
have
some
more
fun
before
that
happens
so
do
we
all
cried
the
others
oh
pshaw
said
night
mare
you
never
let
me
have
any
fun
i
know
why
i
brought
you
here
why
we
brought
you
you
mean
said
gammon
if
it
was
for
us
stay
in
your
stall
all
night
excuse
me
i
forgot
said
night
mare
humbly
well
do
be
ungrateful
that
all
said
spinach
severely
some
people
never
know
when
they
badly
off
gammon
had
perched
himself
again
on
billy
chest
why
do
you
get
up
and
go
to
bogie
man
he
laughed
trying
to
poke
his
fingers
in
billy
eye
i
ca
i
tied
said
billy
time
and
tide
wait
for
no
man
said
gammon
of
course
you
not
time
but
you
tied
i
do
see
why
everybody
tries
to
keep
me
from
seeing
bogie
man
said
billy
because
you
want
to
see
him
said
gammon
that
no
reason
said
billy
certainly
not
there
no
reason
about
any
of
us
most
of
all
bogie
man
you
know
the
old
proverb
says
that
will
not
when
he
may
will
live
to
fight
another
day
i
suppose
you
would
say
there
was
no
reason
to
that
i
certainly
should
said
billy
and
there
you
are
wrong
answered
gammon
there
is
a
reason
for
all
things
only
some
things
have
lost
their
reason
now
you
contradicted
yourself
said
billy
you
just
said
that
there
was
no
reason
about
any
of
you
i
have
a
perfect
right
to
contradict
myself
it
only
rude
to
contradict
other
people
but
which
is
correct
both
how
can
they
both
be
correct
i
do
know
but
they
are
but
my
my
we
wasting
time
we
got
to
dispose
of
you
before
morning
why
before
morning
asked
billy
i
in
no
hurry
you
never
are
said
gammon
night
mare
are
you
ready
for
your
ride
yes
i
will
have
to
start
now
if
i
am
to
have
any
kind
of
a
canter
before
the
cock
crows
good
whispered
billy
to
himself
i
wonder
if
i
can
still
crow
it
worth
trying
anyway
and
snap
the
night
mare
had
broken
her
and
was
off
in
a
jiffy
with
gammon
and
spinach
and
all
the
other
dream
sprites
running
after
her
as
fast
as
they
could
go
billy
shook
himself
sat
up
to
prove
that
he
was
no
longer
tied
down
lay
back
rolled
over
and
in
a
minute
was
sound
asleep
when
billy
woke
up
the
next
morning
he
felt
stiff
and
sore
from
being
tied
down
so
long
by
gammon
and
very
heavy
about
the
eyes
from
his
lack
of
sleep
i
do
feel
very
hungry
this
morning
singing
tree
he
said
i
think
i
save
my
appetite
for
may
i
have
some
eggs
no
sooner
said
than
done
higglepy
piggleby
my
black
hen
she
lays
eggs
for
gentlemen
sometimes
nine
and
sometimes
ten
higglepy
piggleby
my
black
hen
sang
the
singing
tree
and
held
out
a
bowl
of
nine
steaming
hot
eggs
she
is
a
very
good
hen
is
she
said
billy
and
i
suppose
under
the
circumstances
she
must
consider
me
a
gentleman
even
if
i
do
sometimes
forget
to
brush
the
on
the
crown
of
my
head
how
good
he
broke
three
nice
eggs
into
the
cup
the
tree
held
out
to
him
dropped
a
delicious
lump
of
butter
into
the
cup
shook
in
a
little
pepper
and
a
little
salt
and
sat
down
on
the
ground
to
enjoy
his
breakfast
give
the
hen
back
her
eggs
and
as
they
are
cooked
he
said
laughing
maybe
if
she
sits
on
them
she
will
hatch
out
a
chicken
fricassee
for
dinner
and
he
went
to
work
with
a
light
heart
he
had
just
gotten
down
to
the
last
mouthful
when
a
little
speck
of
pepper
that
had
flown
into
his
nose
when
he
seasoned
his
eggs
made
him
sneeze
gehsundheit
and
there
stood
the
little
german
count
who
had
been
so
powerless
to
help
him
in
eggs
aggeration

haf
de
satisfaction
of
knowing
dat
i
am
a
brave
hero
and
a
great
magician
well
if
you
pleased
said
billy
that
something
you
are
right
said
gehsundheit
bowing
low
to
be
pleased
vit
oneself
iss
enough
but
i
accept
your
apology
what
apology
when
you
said
gehsundheit
you
are
a
brave
hero
gas
shall
know
how
pleased
you
are
with
me
billy
looked
hard
at
gehsundheit
to
see
if
he
was
joking
but
he
looked
so
seriously
well
pleased
with
himself
that
billy
did
not
have
the
heart
to
argue
further
and
what
do
you
want
now
said
gehsundheit
nothing
said
billy
you
shall
haf
it
at
once
said
gehsundheit
it
iss
a
hard
task
you
ask
of
me
but
you
shall
haf
it
but
i
said
nothing
said
billy
exactly
but
fear
not
and
spinning
around
on
one
toe
waving
his
arms
above
his
head
and
ending
by
kissing
his
fingers
gehsundheit
rolled
up
his
sleeves
and
said
you
vill
notice
dat
i
haf
no
cuffs
to
deceive
you
and
yet
de
hand
is
quicker
as
de
eye
mumbo
jumbo
zip
boom
rah
it
iss
here
and
reaching
out
he
caught
a
handful
of
air
gravely
handed
it
to
billy
and
disappeared
chapter
ix
in
silly
land
it
was
afternoon
and
billy
was
resting
in
the
shade
of
the
singing
tree
while
barker
played
about
at
his
side
he
was
laughing
softly
to
himself
over
his
experience
with
gehsundheit
that
morning
he
a
funny
little
fellow
calls
himself
a
hero
ha
ha
ha
woof
woof
woof
said
barker
and
billy
looked
up
just
in
time
to
see
him
rush
madly
at
a
man
and
try
to
bury
his
teeth
in
his
leg
i
say
try
because
if
there
was
ever
a
surprised
dog
in
all
the
world
that
dog
was
barker
billy
could
hear
his
teeth
grit
and
scrape
on
the
leg
but
he
made
no
more
impression
on
it
than
if
it
had
been
made
of
stone
and
that
not
strange
because
it
stone
barker
opened
his
jaws
ran
back
a
few
feet
stared
at
the
man
leg
then
up
at
his
face
tucked
his
little
button
of
a
tail
between
his
legs
gave
one
yelp
of
terror
and
leaped
into
billy
arms
it
is
hard
to
tell
whether
it
was
surprise
at
his
failure
or
the
face
that
frightened
barker
perhaps
it
was
both
certainly
the
face
was
enough
to
frighten
any
dog
he
was
made
entirely
of
stone
even
his
constant
smile
showed
the
chisel
marks
but
his
head
was
the
oddest
part
of
him
just
one
straight
line
from
the
tip
of
his
nose
to
the
top
of
his
head
hello
where
did
you
come
from
asked
billy
from
the
quarry
said
the
man
i
an
aztec
fragment
ca
you
tell
that
from
my
features
that
a
good
silly
joke
is
it
you
see
stone
my
features
stone
chiseled
who
is
that
back
of
you
that
my
sister
her
terics
i
his
terics
does
your
dog
bite
said
the
fragment
and
he
and
his
sister
burst
into
gales
of
laughter
illustration
aztec
fragments
his
terics
and
her
sometimes
when
he
hungry
said
billy
knowing
that
they
were
making
fun
of
him
but
he
not
very
fond
of
stone
legs
that
funny
he
ought
to
eat
stone
it
would
give
him
grit
i
do
see
anything
funny
about
that
neither
do
i
but
it
is
silly
is
it
said
the
man
and
he
and
his
sister
giggled
harder
than
ever
well
of
all
the
sillies
i
ever
saw
said
billy
in
disgust
silly
is
as
silly
does
in
silly
land
said
the
fragment
and
again
he
and
her
terics
laughed
until
billy
thought
their
stone
sides
would
crack
look
out
said
he
you
burst
we
already
bursted
said
his
terics
where
we
bursted
into
laughter
of
course
but
is
that
a
good
joke
you
enjoy
your
own
jokes
do
you
said
billy
trying
to
be
sarcastic
so
would
you
if
you
could
make
them
i
was
just
cut
out
for
a
joker
should
say
that
you
were
just
plain
foolish
said
billy
why
do
you
laugh
so
at
nothing
because
we
just
brains
enough
to
be
silly
and
of
course
we
have
to
laugh
at
everything
whether
its
anything
or
nothing
is
that
so
her
yes
said
the
girl
for
goodness
sake
stop
giggling
said
billy
you
set
my
teeth
on
edge
that
good
cried
his
terics
but
suppose
they
on
edge
and
lay
flat
in
your
mouth
you
would
have
to
lie
on
your
side
to
chew
stop
it
said
billy
i
so
nervous
now
i
could
jump
out
of
my
skin
oh
laughed
both
of
them
please
do
that
would
be
awfully
funny
yes
said
his
terics
then
you
would
be
beside
yourself
would
you
well
i
ca
waste
time
with
you
any
longer
i
going
you
think
you
going
but
you
not
said
his
terics
i
show
you
oh
no
oh
no
but
you
not
you
know
said
both
of
them
suddenly
throwing
their
arms
around
his
neck
billy
fought
and
squirmed
and
kicked
but
of
course
as
the
fragments
were
stone
they
easily
held
him
down
nor
could
he
make
any
impression
on
them
with
his
heels
or
fists
oh
do
go
please
do
go
said
his
terics
i
really
go
if
i
were
you
that
all
right
panted
billy
you
got
me
now
but
remember
that
he
who
laughs
last
laughs
best
i
know
that
said
his
terics
because
i
laughed
last
and
it
was
the
best
i
had
in
a
long
time
let
me
go
said
billy
i
a
message
to
deliver
to
bogie
man
that
the
reason
we
here
said
his
terics
but
we
will
take
the
message
oh
yes
we
will
take
the
message
i
have
to
deliver
it
myself
and
besides
i
do
believe
you
take
it
to
him
anyway
of
course
not
we
take
it
but
just
out
of
your
pocket
oh
here
comes
the
gillies
cried
her
terics
now
we
will
have
some
fun
billy
looked
in
the
direction
in
which
she
pointed
and
saw
three
very
very
stupid
looking
fellows
slouching
toward
them
when
the
gillies
got
up
to
where
billy
and
the
fragments
stood
they
stopped
and
without
looking
up
one
of
them
said
do
you
know
where
his
terics
and
her
terics
are
here
we
are
cried
his
terics
at
least
we
think
we
here
if
we
not
wo
you
go
find
us
and
then
come
back
and
tell
us
where
we
to
be
found
why
so
you
are
cried
the
first
speaker
i
did
think
to
look
who
are
these
people
asked
billy
gillies
explained
his
terics
big
gillie
silly
gillie
and
dottie
gillie
you
do
happen
to
know
whether
or
no
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
do
you
boy
asked
big
gillie
of
course
it
not
said
billy
thank
you
you
sure
i
suppose
certainly
my
my
my
the
poor
man
in
the
moon
i
wonder
what
he
eats
and
big
gillie
began
to
weep
there
is
no
man
in
the
moon
said
billy
no
man
in
the
moon
cried
all
the
gillies
and
all
the
aztecs
in
one
breath
no
wicked
boy
said
his
terics
we
were
warned
by
nickel
plate
that
you
did
believe
in
your
mother
goose
but
we
did
think
it
would
be
this
bad
what
is
the
harm
if
i
do
believe
in
such
things
asked
billy
why
if
all
the
children
in
the
world
stopped
believing
in
wicked
giants
and
bogie
man
and
witches
and
bad
things
generally
they
would
have
to
go
to
work
and
earn
an
honest
living
said
his
terics
what
do
they
do
now
they
all
have
more
business
than
they
can
attend
to
frightening
children
it
very
easy
work
and
most
amusing
to
make
little
children
shiver
and
shake
and
cry
especially
when
we
all
know
that
there
never
was
one
of
the
wicked
ones
that
could
really
hurt
anyone
that
is
not
afraid
but
my
my
i
divulging
state
secrets
that
what
comes
of
trying
to
be
serious
and
his
terics
grinned
sadly
what
shall
we
do
with
the
boy
asked
silly
gillie
tie
his
feet
together
and
make
him
run
himself
to
death
suggested
dottie
gillie
how
could
i
run
if
my
feet
were
tied
asked
billy
i
do
know
said
dottie
that
why
i
suggested
it
there
is
nothing
like
finding
out
for
certain
i
know
said
her
terics
make
him
laugh
at
your
jokes
brother
that
will
be
an
awful
punishment
or
yours
said
his
terics
that
would
be
worse
no
we
will
tie
him
out
here
for
a
year
and
let
him
think
things
over
then
if
he
promises
to
go
straight
home
we
will
let
him
go
but
i
starve
said
billy
do
be
obstinate
said
silly
gillie
or
we
make
it
two
years
hand
me
the
rope
said
his
terics
which
one
of
us
has
it
said
the
big
gillie
have
you
brother
or
you
i
do
know
have
we
said
the
other
two
i
do
know
i
sure
said
the
big
one
maybe
i
have
it
at
that
each
one
began
to
search
in
the
others
pockets
for
the
rope
not
in
your
pockets
you
gillies
said
her
terics
how
funny
said
his
terics
not
in
your
pockets
well
it
might
have
been
you
never
can
tell
said
big
gillie
i
do
believe
any
of
us
has
it
hold
this
handing
his
coil
of
rope
to
his
brother
while
i
hunt
in
my
hat
the
other
gillies
took
the
rope
and
stood
looking
at
their
brother
while
he
took
his
hat
off
his
head
and
tore
the
lining
out
there
you
two
are
holding
it
said
his
terics
almost
beside
himself
you
big
gillie
just
handed
it
to
your
brother
so
you
did
what
a
coincidence
said
they
why
of
course
said
big
gillie
how
foolish
of
you
i
knew
all
the
time
that
did
have
it
now
tie
him
tight
said
his
terics
we
do
that
answered
big
gillie
and
in
a
jiffy
they
had
tied
not
billy
at
all
but
his
terics
and
her
terics
though
they
still
held
billy
oh

gillies
cried
his
terics
ca

tied
up
the
wrong
persons
how
strange
said
the
gillies
letting
go
of
billy
in
their
surprise

my
chance
thought
billy
and
stepped
away
to
get
room
for
his
jump
safe
he
had
just
said
to
himself
when
he
found
himself
caught
by
his
collar
not
yet
my
fine
fellow
said
a
voice
haha
so

is

said
nickel
plate
tapping
his
boots
with
the
limber
cane
he
carried
nickel
plate
cried
billy
nickel
plate
cried
the
aztec
fragments
and
the
gillies
foiled
foiled
again
he
hissed
between
his
teeth
then

billy

nickel
plate
and
look
sharp
because

time

her
terics

head
and
laughed
aloud

billy

besides
it

honey
girl

in
me
power
billy
heart
sank
way
way
down
into
his
boots
you
have
captured
honey
girl
he
asked
in
a
trembling
voice
yes
even
now
she
languishes
in
a
donjon
cell
she
goes
to
work
in
the
factory
while
glucose
takes
her
place
in
the
queen
bee
palace

billy

but
a
polished
villain
she
wo

long
after

bogie

nickel
plate
snapped
his
fingers
in
billy
face
that
for
you
i
do
not
fear
your
threats
i
have
you
in
me
power
now
that
for
you
cried
all
the
aztecs
and
the
gillies
snapping
their
fingers
and
treading
on
billy
toes
just
to
show
that
they
fear
him
the
note
the
note
or
i
shall
strike
you
to
the
cried
nickel
plate
and
raising
his
cane
he
stepped
back
to
strike
but
it
was
a
fatal
step
for
he
stumbled
over
big
gillie
and
fell
flat
on
his
back
in
falling
he
let
go
of
billy
collar
and
you
may
be
sure
billy
did
waste
any
time
in
jumping
up
and
away
catch
him
cried
nickel
plate
certainly
cried
the
gillies
stumbling
over
each
other
certainly
cried
his
terics
and
her
terics
stumbling
over
the
gillies
and
falling
plump
onto
nickel
plate
and
you
can
well
imagine
that
it
was
not
a
very
light
fall
ugh
groaned
nickel
plate
how
funny
laughed
the
fragments
rolling
over
and
over
on
nickel
plate
cried
billy
and
floated
away
chapter
x
sea
urchin
and
do
eel
now
although
billy
felt
very
happy
indeed
to
have
escaped
nickel
plate
the
aztec
fragments
and
the
gillies
he
was
very
much
worried
about
honey
girl
and
as
he
floated
along
through
the
air
he
pictured
her
weeping
in
her
lonely
cell
i
wonder
if
nickel
plate
told
me
the
truth
he
said
to
himself
and
if
he
did
what
happened
to
good
old
general
merchandise
and
the
bee
soldiers
i
wish
i
knew
hello
called
a
voice
in
his
ear
he
looked
around
but
could
see
no
one
that
strange
he
said
hello
is
that
billy
bounce
yes
who
are
you
and
where

you
said
billy
in
amaze
i
am
gas
and
i
at
home
said
the
voice
then
where

said
billy
thinking
he
had
suddenly
lost
his
mind
you
wherever
you

said
gas
voice
i
talking
to
you
over
the
wireless
telephone
less

billy

honey
girl

safe
i
have
my
eye
on
her
as
well
as

you
how

a
long
way
off
from
bogie
man
house
you
are
nearer
than
you
were
when
you
were
not
so
near
as
you
are
now
so
keep
afloat
and
you
will
get
there
all
right
thank

said
billy
i
try
well
i
thought
i
would
ease
your
mind
a
bit
the
suit
carry
you
and
a
heavy
heart
very
fast
nor
far
you
know
thank
you
said
billy
now
i
feel
lighter
hearted
he
said
and
sure
enough
instead
of
falling
which
he
had
just
begun
to
do
he
rose
several
feet
in
the
air
but
as
the
old
proverb
says
what
goes
up
must
come
down
and
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
on
the
ground
again
this
time
he
stood
on
the
sandy
beach
of
a
great
sea
i
wonder
if
i
can
jump
all
the
way
across
he
said
aloud
ask
me
not
in
mournful
numbers
what
a
boy
has
dreams
sleep
is
real
sleep
is
earnest
hash
is
seldom
what
it
seems
and
a
great
eel
wagged
his
head
solemnly
at
billy
from
a
few
feet
off
the
shore
did
you
speak
said
billy
no
i
sang
which
is
worse
said
the
eel
sadly
i
thought
it
was
you
it
was
you
it
was
i
said
the
eel
what
a
sad
world
it
is
to
be
sure
how
do
you
mean
asked
billy
i
do
mean
i
swim
and
that
a
terrible
bore
i
think
swimming
is
lots
of
fun
said
billy
not
when
you
do
it
for
a
living
it
stops
being
fun
when
you
have
to
i
suppose
so
said
billy
thoughtfully
but
then
you
see
i
never
had
to
do
it
for
a
living
then
do
ever
take
it
up
i
been
at
it
all
my
life
and
i
very
tired
why
i
almost
forgotten
how
to
climb
trees
what
your
name
billy
bounce
so
you
billy
bounce
i
do
eel
and
though
he
smiled
the
eel
looked
very
very
sly
how
do
you
do
said
billy
politely
i
do
do
that
the
reason
i
called
do
eel
oh
said
billy
then
how
do
you
do
pretty
badly
i
do
thank
you
but
come
you
must
hear
me
sing
this
song
was
discomposed
by
the
whistling
buoy
set
to
music
by
sand
bars
and
dedicated
to
me
and
balancing
himself
on
a
large
wave
the
eel
began
to
sing
in
a
sad
voice
the
song
of
the
do
eel
the
do
eel
raised
his
dreamy
eye
and
said
with
a
ponderous
weary
sigh
i
really
yes
really
try
to
try
but
i
tired
let
go
and
lie
in
the
cool
sweet
shade
of
an
apple
pie
and
think
of
the
which
and
what
and
why
oh
why
is
the
whatness
of
which
and
when
if
then
were
now
what
would
be
then
because
and
but
oh
what
the
use
will
do
is
my
excuse
how
that
said
do
eel
when
he
had
finished
very
pretty
said
billy
but
is
it
is
it
very
sensible
i
really
do
know
nobody
ever
understands
it
so
of
course
it
must
be
very
fine
i
suppose
so
said
billy
wondering
if
do
eel
was
quite
in
his
right
mind
come
in
the
water
fine
called
a
funny
bristly
little
fellow
popping
his
head
up
beside
do
eel
no
thank
you
said
billy
not
wishing
to
join
company
with
such
a
prickly
looking
individual
aw
come
on
see
it
only
so
deep
and
he
held
up
one
hand
you
treading
water
said
billy
how
did
you
guess
it
asked
the
sea
urchin
i
can
see
your
feet
so
can
i
see
your
feet
but
you
not
treading
water
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
billy
just
what
i
trying
to
prove
to
you
said
the
urchin
are
you
coming
in
or
shall
i
have
to
come
out
and
get
you
neither
said
billy
jumping
up
very
very
hard
because
he
knew
it
would
take
a
long
leap
to
carry
him
over
the
sea
i
suppose
they
are
harmless
said
billy
to
himself
but
i
glad
enough
to
be
away
from
them
that
eel
looks
like
a
slippery
old
fellow
and
the
urchin
has
a
bad
face
up
up
up
he
went
floated
forward
quite
a
distance
stopped
just
a
second
and
then
began
to
fall
i
believe
i
am
going
to
make
it
he
began
and
then
looked
beneath
him
alas
poor
billy
the
shore
was
yet
far
distant
and
he
knew
that
he
was
bound
to
fall
into
the
sea
how
he
did
kick
and
wave
his
arms
he
even
tried
to
swim
through
the
air
but
though
this
helped
him
a
little
it
did
carry
him
far
enough
forward
to
reach
the
shore
thank
goodness
i
have
on
my
rubber
suit
i
ca
sink
anyway
said
he
and
splash
he
hit
the
water
where
he
bobbed
up
and
down
like
a
cork
but
his
troubles
were
not
yet
over
for
he
was
horrified
to
see
do
eel
and
the
sea
urchin
swimming
along
at
his
side
so
you
decided
to
drop
in
on
us
after
all
said
the
urchin
have
you
chosen
a
life
on
the
bouncing
wave
as
a
profession
asked
do
eel
in
spite
of
my
warning
that
you
would
do
well
to
bid
farewell
to
if
you
chose
yelp
yelp
said
barker
climbing
up
onto
billy
shoulder
where
he
stood
shivering
miserably
what
that
thing
asked
the
sea
urchin
my
dog
said
billy
do
tell
me
that
a
dog
fish
said
do
eel
because
never
believe
you
you
do
have
to
answered
billy
because
he
is
not
a
dog
fish
he
a
dog
oh
you
mean
a
fish
dog
you
sure
he
not
a
bird
dog
a
flying
fish
dog
you
know
no
just
a
plain
dog
he
plain
enough
goodness
knows
but
a
dog
humph
who
ever
heard
of
a
dog
without
fins
said
the
urchin
why
ridiculous
i
expect
there
are
lots
of
things
you
never
heard
of
it
made
billy
angry
to
have
his
word
doubted
especially
when
there
was
barker
to
prove
them
true
ridiculous
said
do
eel
how
can
we
help
seeing
everything
in
the
sea
he
who
sees
seas
sees
everything
in
season
billy
did
think
this
worth
answering
so
he
redoubled
his
efforts
to
reach
the
shore
my
how
he
did
make
the
water
boil
dashing
spray
way
over
his
head
and
making
poor
barker
blink
with
the
water
he
dashed
into
his
eyes
with
a
little
practice
you
might
learn
to
swim
said
the
urchin
but
you
make
lots
of
fuss
in
the
water
so
would
you
on
dry
land
panted
billy
but
we
would
be
so
silly
as
to
go
on
dry
land
said
the
eel
i
suppose
that
as
much
as
to
say
that
it
silly
of
me
to
come
into
the
sea
take
it
or
leave
it
if
the
white
cap
fits
you
do
put
it
on
said
the
urchin
turning
a
somersault
in
the
water
where
are
you
going
asked
do
eel
yes
you
seem
in
a
great
hurry
said
the
urchin
i
going
ashore
as
fast
as
i
can
said
billy
that
your
first
guess
try
another
said
the
eel
sticking
his
face
up
into
billy
i
do
guess
it
i
know
it
answered
billy
striving
to
keep
his
courage
up
no
is
the
right
answer
said
the
sea
urchin
why
should
i
go
ashore
just
because
replied
the
eel
oh
gracious
what
a
sad
world
it
is
here
a
boy
that
thinks
he
knows
but
how
are
you
going
to
prevent
it
said
billy
i
not
afraid
of
you
we
will
prevent
it
this
way
said
do
eel
winding
his
tail
around
billy
legs
and
this
way
said
the
sea
urchin
pricking
a
hole
in
billy
suit
with
one
of
his
bristles
poor
billy
felt
himself
getting
thinner
and
thinner
as
the
air
bubbled
out
of
the
suit
and
while
he
knew
that
he
could
swim
and
so
keep
afloat
a
while
longer
he
was
well
aware
that
in
a
very
few
minutes
all
would
be
over
and
he
would
go
down
down
down
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
barker
seemed
to
know
it
too
for
he
whined
piteously
now
tell
me
that
there
is
not
just
one
more
fish
in
the
sea
that
never
was
caught
said
do
eel
triumphantly
billy
did
answer
for
he
knew
that
he
must
save
his
breath
but
when
he
saw
a
plank
floating
just
within
reach
he
could
not
resist
a
feeble
hurrah
it
required
but
a
second
for
him
to
throw
his
arms
over
it
and
cling
on
for
dear
life
that
what
comes
of
having
planked
white
fish
for
dinner
said
do
eel
the
sea
urchin
seeing
what
billy
had
done
swam
madly
about
trying
to
find
another
opportunity
for
stinging
him
with
his
bristles
but
was
unable
to
make
any
impression
through
his
wet
clothes
do
eel
thrashed
the
water
into
a
perfect
foam
in
his
efforts
to
drag
billy
and
the
plank
down
but
barring
giving
billy
an
occasional
ducking
and
making
barker
yelp
with
fright
he
could
do
nothing
suddenly
billy
felt
the
plank
sink
deeper
into
the
water
so
that
his
chin
was
barely
above
the
surface
at
the
same
moment
a
voice
said
umberufen
and
there
balancing
himself
on
the
plank
stood
umberufen
get
off
you
sinking
us
cried
billy
you
called
me
said
umberufen
i
did
you
touched
wood
and
i
sure
it
very
inconsiderate
of
you
to
call
me
way
out
here
to
sea
i
do
want
you
said
billy
then
you
should
have
called
me
goodness
knows
i
not
here
because
i
want
to
be
i
can
feel
myself
warping
already
do
go
away
said
billy
ca
you
see
it
all
i
can
do
to
keep
afloat
i
help
you
said
umberufen
how
illustration
get
off
you
sinking
us
cried
page
i
do
know
who
is
your
friend
with
a
face
like
a
that
sea
urchin
and
he
is
trying
to
drown
me
you
must
not
do
that
you
know
said
umberufen
it
very
wrong
then
turning
to
billy
he
whispered
leave
him
to
me
i
give
him
a
good
talking
to
that
all
you
can
do
said
billy
desperately
talk
talk
talk
i
do
want
words
i
want
help
come
down
come
down
oh
why
be
so
obstinate
cried
the
eel
lashing
the
water
gentlemen
said
umberufen
sticking
one
hand
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
and
bowing
very
low
almost
too
low
for
just
at
that
moment
the
plank
twisted
and
he
came
very
near
going
overboard
gentlemen
you
are
doing
very
very
wrong
bravo
cried
the
sea
urchin
thank
you
for
the
compliment
stop
it
and
get
away
cried
billy
ingrate
cried
umberufen
ca
you
see
that
already
i
have
won
their
hearts
did
you
not
hear
the
applause
of
course
i
did
said
billy
but
it
only
because
they
want
to
keep
you
here
so
that
they
can
pull
me
down
but
if
you
really
want
to
help
me
for
goodness
sake
pump
me
up
and
stop
the
leak
in
my
suit
i
wish
i
could
said
umberufen
but
i
am
not
a
mechanic
i
am
a
thinker
you
a
nuisance
but
just
at
that
minute
billy
feet
touched
bottom
looking
up
he
found
that
in
the
excitement
of
the
events
he
had
drifted
within
a
few
feet
of
shore
splash
dash
curl
bing
and
a
wave
had
carried
him
well
ashore
do
eel
let
go
his
hold
when
he
saw
the
case
was
hopeless
and
he
and
sea
urchin
bobbed
about
on
the
waves
shaking
their
fists
and
gnashing
their
teeth
in
despair
at
having
lost
him
ugh
cried
umberufen
i
told
you
i
get
wet
helping
you
and
there
stood
the
miserable
little
man
soaked
through
and
through
i
warned
you
said
billy
i
i
i
said
umberufen
his
teeth
chattering
but
i
stood
to
my
post
like
a
man
that
what
comes
of
being
brave
and
brainy
i
going
home
to
change
my
clothes
and
away
he
went
do
eel
and
sea
urchin
called
billy
running
up
the
beach
death
on
the
bounding
wave
is
as
easy
as
you
thought
is
it
chapter
xi
in
derby
town
poor
billy
was
in
despair
over
his
punctured
suit
it
is
a
good
thing
he
had
no
mirror
to
see
how
like
a
broken
toy
balloon
he
looked
or
he
would
have
felt
even
worse
he
tried
pumping
it
up
with
his
hot
air
pump
but
it
was
no
use
the
air
came
right
out
of
the
hole
if
i
had
just
thought
to
bring
some
bicycle
tyre
tape
he
said
examining
the
puncture
carefully
or
if
i
had
some
gum
when
he
said
this
barker
ran
up
to
him
and
laying
his
head
in
his
lap
looked
up
at
him
knowingly
what
is
it
old
doggie
do
you
feel
sorry
too
i
sure
i
do
know
what
is
to
become
of
us
we
shall
have
to
walk
now
of
course
we
still
have
the
singing
tree
that
so
the
tree
do
you
suppose
you
could
bark
up
any
other
kind
of
tree
a
gum
tree
but
how
barker
nodded
his
head
and
wagged
his
tail
as
much
as
to
say
of
course
i
can
just
try
me
i
have
it
cried
billy
and
tearing
in
two
pieces
the
that
gehsundheit
had
given
him
he
carefully
wrapped
and
tied
one
half
of
it
over
barker
lower
set
of
teeth
and
the
other
half
over
his
upper
set
it
was
a
tedious
operation
but
finally
barker
stood
before
him
with
his
teeth
all
hidden
and
nothing
but
his
gums
exposed
barker
did
mind
indeed
he
seemed
to
know
just
what
billy
was
about
and
capered
and
danced
with
glee
now
we
will
see
what
a
gum
bark
will
grow
into
said
billy
quickly
digging
a
hole
over
to
it
ran
barker
and
stood
holding
his
nose
down
pinch
wow
wow
went
the
dog
a
muffled
bark
for
all
the
world
like
a
toothless
old
man
trying
to
talk
in
a
jiffy
the
dirt
was
shoveled
in
and
up
sprang
a
gum
tree
yes
there
instead
of
the
singing
tree
stood
a
gum
tree
its
branches
laden
with
yucatan
and
pepsin
and
tutti
frutti
hurrah
cried
billy
shaking
down
package
after
package
of
gum
and
popping
a
great
piece
into
his
mouth
he
chewed
away
for
dear
life
quickly
he
spread
the
soft
sticky
mass
over
a
piece
of
cloth
snipped
from
the
lining
of
his
jacket
and
pressed
the
whole
thing
over
the
puncture
it
stuck
as
close
and
as
tight
as
and
billy
knew
that
he
was
indeed
repaired
went
the
hot
air
pump
and
there
stood
billy
as
round
and
fat
as
ever
with
never
a
leak
in
his
suit
thank
you
barker
old
boy
said
billy
patting
barker
head
and
taking
the
handkerchief
out
of
his
mouth
and
now
we
must
be
off
so
saying
he
tucked
the
dog
under
his
arm
and
jumped
up
and
away
far
far
away
they
sailed
the
gum
seemed
to
have
given
the
suit
new
life
and
why
should
magic
gum
improve
a
magic
suit
it
seemed
to
billy
that
this
jump
was
by
far
the
longest
he
had
ever
taken
illustration
saw
flying
to
meet
him
several
shaggy
page
indeed
he
felt
so
very
happy
that
he
commenced
to
sing
over
the
hills
and
far
away
but
alas
for
billy
this
was
a
fatal
step
he
had
hardly
gotten
any
further
in
his
song
than
far
away
when
he
saw
flying
to
meet
him
several
shaggy
bears
i
suppose
i
in
for
it
now
he
said
to
himself
they
look
fierce
enough
to
be
some
more
of
nickel
plate
friends
i
wonder
if
i
shall
ever
get
to
bogie
man
house
anyway
growled
the
foremost
bear
when
they
got
in
speaking
distance
growled
the
other
bears
but
true
to
his
habit
billy
put
on
a
bold
front
and
smiling
politely
said
good
afternoon
afternoon
said
the
first
bear
gruffly
and
then
all
the
bears
surrounded
billy
and
flew
along
by
his
side
billy
was
really
very
much
disturbed
by
this
but
turning
to
the
largest
bear
he
said
i
see
that
you
were
bound
in
the
opposite
direction
to
me
and
though
i
appreciate
your
company
i
would
detain
you
for
the
world
mind
your
own
business
growled
the
bear
i
trying
to
said
billy
excuse
me
i
seen
many
dancing
bears
but
i
never
until
now
laid
my
eyes
on
flying
ones
we
bugbears
if
that
what
you
want
to
know
said
the
bear
in
a
surly
voice
thank
you
said
billy
smiling
in
hopes
that
by
being
very
very
polite
and
pleasant
himself
he
could
improve
their
temper
save
your
thanks
they
are
not
wanted
my
goodness
you
as
cross
as
a
bear
interrupted
the
big
bear
exactly
and
i
proud
of
it
what
the
good
of
being
polite
tell
the
truth
i
say
no
matter
whom
it
hurts
i
sure
that
the
truth
is
always
best
said
billy
it
not
said
the
bear
never
tell
it
if
it
does
hurt
under
those
circumstances
i
say
tell
a
bear
faced
lie
you
have
a
very
sweet
disposition
have
you
no
thank
goodness
i
have
what
would
a
bug
bear
do
with
a
sweet
disposition
unless
he
could
eat
it
i
do
know
said
billy
of
course
you
do
nobody
ever
said
you
did
boys
do
know
anything
here
we
are
cried
the
little
bug
bear
and
sure
enough
they
were
standing
in
the
strangest
of
strange
looking
towns
every
house
and
every
building
was
covered
with
an
enormous
derby
hat
while
the
windows
and
doors
were
so
arranged
that
at
a
little
distance
they
looked
like
the
eyes
and
nose
and
mouth
of
a
face
where
are
we
asked
billy
looking
about
him
in
surprise
derby
town
where
else
do
you
think
said
big
bug
bear
i
did
know
said
billy
for
goodness
sake
say
something
original
said
the
bear
crossly
what
an
idiot
you
are
to
be
sure
billy
ignored
this
remark
he
had
had
some
experience
with
cross
people
in
his
messenger
service
people
who
were
cross
for
no
earthly
reason
but
that
he
was
a
little
boy
and
he
had
always
found
it
better
to
say
as
little
as
possible
when
they
bullied
him
nevertheless
it
made
him
very
very
uncomfortable
and
of
course
the
more
uncomfortable
he
got
the
more
blunders
he
made
ca
you
stand
up
you
all
feet
i
declare
said
big
bug
bear
when
billy
stumbled
over
a
stone
in
the
path
with
that
he
gave
him
a
push
that
nearly
sent
him
on
his
face
stand
up
i
tell
you
said
the
bear
catching
him
by
the
arm
and
jerking
him
back
so
that
he
nearly
fell
on
his
back
this
time
excuse
me
sir
i
did
mean
to
said
billy
almost
ready
to
cry
did
mean
to
did
mean
to
do
tell
me
that
you
did
it
on
purpose
anyone
can
see
that
with
half
an
eye
and
with
that
all
the
bug
bears
took
turns
in
pulling
and
jerking
him
about
billy
was
afraid
to
resent
it
for
their
teeth
looked
very
white
and
very
sharp
and
their
claws
looked
very
long
but
he
kept
his
eyes
open
for
some
means
of
escape
after
a
while
though
this
exercise
seemed
to
put
them
in
a
little
better
temper
just
as
it
does
lots
of
human
bears
and
they
allowed
billy
to
walk
along
with
only
an
occasional
cuff
or
jerk
what
are
those
billy
finally
ventured
to
ask
pointing
to
a
row
of
things
along
the
sidewalk
hat
trees
silly
said
one
of
the
bears
ca
you
see
the
hat
on
the
top
oh
said
billy
they
very
funny
are
they
not
a
bit
funny
said
big
bug
bear
and
if
you
had
to
listen
to
their
bands
all
night
you
would
think
so
either
what
kind
of
bands
asked
billy
illustration
hat
hat
bands
of
course
they
brimful
of
horrid
noises
oh
said
billy
and
relapsed
into
silence
by
this
time
they
had
walked
quite
a
distance
and
though
billy
had
kept
his
eyes
open
for
a
chance
to
escape
one
or
another
of
the
bears
had
hold
of
his
arm
all
of
the
time
i
suppose
you
know
why
we
have
captured
you
said
big
bug
bear
finally
because
you
do
want
me
to
find
bogie
man
i
expect
said
billy
for
once
in
your
life
you
are
correct
little
credit
to
you
though
but
why
why
what
why
do
you
want
me
to
find
him
he
our
cousin
for
one
thing
and
for
another
thing
it
our
business
to
keep
people
from
doing
anything
they
want
to
and
you
expect
to
keep
me
from
it
asked
billy
indeed
we
do
said
big
bug
bear
how
you
find
out
soon
enough
now
stop
your
talking
billy
shut
his
lips
tight
and
walked
along
with
a
sinking
heart
is
he
a
sulky
brat
said
little
bug
bear
pouting
along
and
not
saying
a
word
but
you
told
me
to
stop
talking
said
billy
do
be
impertinent
said
big
bug
bear
shaking
him
if
you
speak
politely
to
your
elders
you
need
speak
at
all
my
my
how
billy
did
hate
the
bug
bears
for
that
pinching
and
beating
anything
he
had
been
through
could
not
have
hurt
him
worse
than
this
treatment
the
bug
bears
seemed
to
know
it
for
they
bullied
him
back
and
forth
and
forth
and
back
until
he
thought
he
would
go
crazy
here
we
are
at
last
said
big
bug
bear
stopping
in
front
of
a
derby
house
yes
and
if
this
boy
had
lagged
so
on
the
way
we
have
been
here
an
hour
ago
said
another
bug
bear
crossly
get
in
with
you
and
giving
billy
a
push
through
the
door
he
and
the
rest
followed
close
after
indoors
they
were
greeted
by
another
bug
bear
greeted
is
hardly
the
word
because
that
seems
to
mean
some
kind
of
a
smile
or
a
pleasant
hand
shake
as
it
was
the
bug
bear
got
up
sulkily
from
a
corner
where
he
had
been
lying
and
grunted
by
way
of
how
do
you
do
we
got
billy
bounce
said
big
bug
bear
huh
at
last
it
took
you
long
enough
goodness
knows
said
the
first
speaker
surlily
we
did
come
here
to
talk
said
big
bug
bear
angrily
get
to
work
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
me
kill
me
asked
billy
no
not
if
you
do
what
you
told
said
little
bug
bear
worse
than
that
said
big
bug
bear
we
going
to
operate
on
your
eyes
said
the
owner
of
the
place
blind
me
cried
billy
oh
do
blind
me
wait
and
see
growled
big
bug
bear
oh
but
i
rather
you
killed
me
than
put
my
eyes
out
how
could
i
see
to
get
around
you
be
able
to
see
to
get
around
said
little
bug
bear
but
you
wo
be
able
to
see
bogie
man
but
i
must
i
have
a
message
for
him
oh
good
bug
bear
oh
kind
bug
bear
do

that

him

and
stop
his
noise
said
big
bug
bear
giving
billy
a
shake
and
listen
quietly
billy
bounce
or
give
you
a
beating
i
going
to
take
a
picture
said
the
photographer
bug
bear
my
picture
asked
billy
relieved
your
picture
your
picture
growled
the
photographer
do
you
think
i
have
nothing
better
to
do
than
take
ugly
fat
boys
pictures
huh
then
whose
big
bug
bear
of
course
billy
looked
around
the
room
for
a
camera
but
could
see
nothing
but
bare
walls
not
even
a
photograph
was
to
be
seen
much
less
the
large
glass
cases
of
brides
and
grooms
and
military
men
and
little
boys
and
girls
with
sand
buckets
and
shovels
in
their
hands
have
you
a
camera
asked
he
you
the
camera
what
else
did
you
think
grunted
the
photographer
am
exclaimed
billy
in
surprise
i
said
you
yes
now
stand
up
will
you
there
and
the
photographer
stood
him
up
in
front
of
him
holding
in
his
hand
a
great
big
round
black
cap
such
as
photographers
put
over
the
lens
of
a
camera
sit
down
big
bug
bear
in
that
chair
in
front
of
billy
bounce
please
so
that
it
head
a
little
higher
look
at
the
camera
it
and
the
photographer
threw
a
black
cloth
over
billy
head
and
turned
it
here
and
there
just
as
if
he
were
focusing
a
camera
but
what
is
it
for
asked
billy
little
bug
bear
spoke
up
indeed
he
seemed
to
be
the
kindest
one
of
all
of
them
perhaps
because
he
was
the
youngest
were
going
to
photograph
big
bug
bear
on
your
eyes
so
hereafter
never
be
able
to
see
anything
without
a
bug
bear
in
it
and
as
bug
bears
keep
people
from
succeeding
in
everything
they
attempt
you
will
never
succeed
in
finding
bogie
man
there
now
you
have
it
and
i
hope
you
will
stay
quiet
oh
but
that
will
be
terrible
said
billy
of
course
it
will
but
we
do
care
be
still
growled
the
photographer
big
bug
bear
move
your
right
hand
a
little
more
to
the
left
please
that
better
now
look
unpleasant
good
at
this
big
bug
bear
opened
his
mouth
very
wide
and
showed
his
teeth
when
plump
one
of
his
teeth
which
must
have
been
very
loose
fell
out
of
his
mouth
and
squashed
on
the
floor
why
exclaimed
billy
his
teeth
are
dough
then
turning
to
the
photographer
he
looked
in
his
mouth
and
yours
then
looking
at
the
others
and
yours
and
yours
all
of
you
then
reaching
out
suddenly
he
caught
hold
of
the
photographer
paw
and
your
claws
are
rubber
hurrah
hurrah
i
do
fear
you
now
the
bug
bears
were
all
so
startled
that
they
did
not
make
a
move
and
before
they
knew
it
billy
had
pulled
out
his
and
was
beating
them
all
about
the
head
all
but
little
bug
bear
who
scuttled
out
of
the
door
at
the
first
move
billy
made
oh
oh
oh
ouch
ouch
ouch
cried
the
bug
bears
running
about
and
trying
to
get
to
the
door
let
us
go
let
us
go
and
in
a
minute
billy
was
all
alone
so
that
all
bug
bears
amount
to
he
said
they
will
never
frighten
me
again
and
walking
leisurely
out
of
the
door
he
jumped
up
and
away
from
derby
town
and
the
bug
bears
forever
chapter
xii
the
next
time
billy
alighted
he
examined
his
suit
with
great
care
for
fear
his
adventures
with
the
bug
bears
had
strained
the
patch
over
the
puncture
but
to
his
great
delight
he
found
that
it
held
as
tightly
as
ever
as
it
happened
he
had
stopped
on
a
dusty
highway
just
outside
the
gates
of
a
city
we
will
call
it
a
city
because
billy
later
learned
that
its
inhabitants
did
so
but
to
billy
gaze
it
seemed
but
a
collection
of
the
poorest
huts
illustration
and
as
he
stood
punching
and
pulling
and
examining
his
suit
a
party
of
horsemen
and
horsewomen
rode
up
a
few
feet
in
advance
of
the
rest
of
the
party
rode
a
tattered
and
torn
individual
on
a
lame
horse
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
battered
old
fish
horn
on
which
he
occasionally
blew
a
feeble
blast
this
he
followed
by
calling
in
a
voice
loud
enough
to
make
up
for
the
wheeziness
of
his
horn
out
of
the
way
out
of
the
way
o
the
king
rides
what
if
he
does
said
billy
to
himself
i
do
too
when
i
can
catch
behind
a
street
car
out
of
the
way
cried
the
man
pulling
up
his
horse
out
of
the
way
boy
i
not
in
the
way
there
plenty
of
room
for
you
to
pass
and
i
do
want
to
climb
down
into
the
ditch
said
billy
but
the
king
passes
out
of
the
way
well
i
be
in
that
town
by
the
time
he
comes
along
he
is
here
varlet
where
that
noble
looking
gentleman
in
rich
raiment
true
a
trifle
faded
but
rich
he
that
rides
alone
do
you
mean
the
one
on
the
blind
mare
true
the
mare
is
blind
but
that
is
her
misfortune
not
her
fault
she
comes
of
fine
stock
yes
that
is
our
great
and
noble
comic
paper
irish
king
a
comic
paper
irish
king
said
billy
is
he
irish
no
said
the
horn
man
not
really
irish
he
the
kind
of
irish
they
have
in
comic
papers
illustration
the
comic
paper
irish
billy
was
bewildered
he
looked
from
the
king
to
his
company
from
the
company
to
the
horn
man
and
then
back
again
to
the
king
such
a
faded
worn
torn
uncut
unshaven
and
unkempt
crowd
he
had
never
seen
outside
of
a
company
of
beggars
and
such
nags
as
they
bestrode
the
lame
the
halt
and
the
blind
were
all
represented
among
their
horses
while
donkeys
and
mules
in
all
states
of
decrepitude
carried
others
so
that
is
the
king
said
billy
ay
the
king
and
his
retinue
of
noble
ladies
and
gentlemen
out
of
the
way
here
the
king
spoke
phwat
detains
our
noble
silf
herald
and
so
this
crazy
quilt
is
the
herald
is
it
said
billy
to
himself
and
true
enough
when
he
examined
the
man
tattered
clothes
more
closely
he
saw
that
he
wore
a
much
dilapidated
herald
tabard
a
base
born
fat
boy
your
serene
highness
who
refuses
to
out
of
the
way
though

have
outed

times

billy

cried
a
voice
he
called
his
highness
your
honor
that
lèse
majesty
whispered
the
herald
to
billy
oh

his
name
then
turning
to
the
king
he
bowed
low
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon
your
lazy
majesty

cried
the
company
of
men
spurring
their
horses
into
a
rapid
walk

called
his
majesty

thought
that

his
name
said
billy
herald
here

the

in
consternation

of
good

said
a
fierce
looking
old
man
saluting
and
riding
a
few
paces
to
the
rear
then
saluting
the
air
he
gravely
said
colonel
swash
buckler

this
time

ground
and
said

had
committed
lèse
majesty
which
means
that
he
had
insulted
you
it
latin
it
latin
is
it
cried
the
king
latin
you
say
how
dare
you
talk
latin
before
me
when
brogue
is
the
court
language
i
fine
you
a
pay
but
your
majesty
pardon
i
have
received
no
pay
for
two
years
sure
said
the
king
and
your
salary
is
a
month
yes
sire
said
the
herald
smiling
because
he
thought
the
king
was
going
to
give
him
all
his
back
pay
yes
sire
forgive
me
for
reminding
you
you
are
forgiven
said
the
king
and
now
gyard
search
him
and
take
from
his
pockets
but
your
majesty
began
the
herald
enough
i
ca
remit
the
fine
and
if
you
have
the
money
you
must
pay
it
in
a
jiffy
private
swash
buckler
had
fished
in
nickels
and
dimes
from
the
herald
pockets
and
handed
it
to
the
king
and
now
me
vartuous
subjects
give
three
cheers
for
your
noble
and
generous
king
and
we
will
enter
the
city
hurrah
hurrah
cried
the
people
even
the
herald
gave
three
feeble
toots
on
his
horn
said
billy
hoping
that
by
this
gentle
hint
they
would
understand
that
he
did
not
desire
their
company
any
further
indeed
he
felt
uneasy
about
the
few
coppers
in
his
own
pockets
in
the
presence
of
such
a
free
handed
king
not
so
fast
me
young
friend
said
the
king
you
must
come
with
us
truly
your
majesty
i
have
the
time
said
billy
i
did
ask
you
for
the
time
said
the
king
so
whether
you
have
it
or
have
it
you
have
to
take
it
forward
and
billy
found
himself
in
the
grasp
of
private
swash
buckler
and
being
led
in
the
direction
of
the
city
they
had
far
to
go
and
in
spite
of
their
naturally
slow
progress
with
such
sorry
steeds
billy
soon
found
himself
within
the
gates
and
oh
what
a
place
dirty
miry
streets
pigs
every
place
tumbledown
leaky
roofed
houses
and
ragged
people
and
the
palace
well
billy
would
never
in
the
world
have
known
it
for
a
palace
if
the
king
had
told
him
it
was
it
was
simply
a
larger
dirtier
more
tumbledown
house
than
any
of
the
others
with
more
and
fatter
pigs
in
the
front
yard
bring
in
the
prisoner
gyard
said
the
king
dismounting
and
picking
his
way
up
the
tottering
steps
prisoner
cried
billy
what
have
i
done
to
be
made
a
prisoner
i
do
know
yet
said
the
king
but
i
will
find
something
we
have
had
a
prisoner
for
years
and
now
that
i
got
one
i
not
going
to
let
him
go
again
for
such
a
simple
reason
as
his
having
done
nothing
wrong
am
i
right
ladies
and
gentlemen
always
right
never
left
cried
the
retinue
who
were
now
entering
the
palace
i
thought
you
would
agree
with
me
said
the
king
but
sometimes
left
it
a
poor
ruler
that
does
work
both
ways
come
in
billy
was
hustled
into
the
palace
which
he
found
hung
with
torn
and
faded
tapestry
the
floor
had
not
been
swept
or
scrubbed
for
years
and
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
solid
four
legged
chair
in
the
room
with
the
exception
perhaps
of
the
throne
which
was
built
entirely
of
irish
potatoes
and
now
said
the
king
putting
his
crown
rakishly
on
one
side
of
his
head
now
i
prepared
to
open
court
first
has
any
one
here
any
petitions
in
writing
when
he
said
this
an
old
man
hobbled
up
and
kneeling
with
many
crackings
of
joints
before
the
king
laid
a
paper
at
his
feet
what
is
it
asked
the
king
a
request
sire
that
my
daughter
refused
said
who
next
please
leave
the
papers
but
sire
i
positively
must
refuse
but
i
thank
you
for
the
petition
me
crown
is
a
bit
too
large
for
comfort
and
folding
the
paper
into
a
strip
he
placed
it
in
his
crown
which
he
put
on
with
much
satisfaction
so
that
over
with
bring
the
bye
before
me
he
is
here
sire
said
private
swash
buckler
leading
billy
before
the
throne
kneel
boy
what
your
name
said
the
king
billy
bounce
said
billy
and
what
a
shout
and
roar
went
up
from
the
company
even
the
king
jumped
to
his
feet
in
his
excitement
and
threw
his
crown
into
the
air
billy
bounce
they
cried
billy
bounce
we
caught
billy
bounce
what
a
good
day
work
cried
the
king
from
the
herald
and
from
bumbus
for
catching
billy
bounce
but
your
majesty
began
billy
do
talk
to
me
interrupted
the
king
unless
you
can
offer
to
be
set
free
alas
i
have
that
much
said
billy
too
bad
too
bad
said
and
now
i
suppose
i
have
to
off
with
your
head
oh
sir
please
please
do
cried
billy
struggling
with
swash
buckler
do
lose
your
head
said
the
king
because
i
want
to
have
it
chopped
off
but
sir
began
billy
sire
and
a
man
wearing
a
tall
pointed
cap
and
a
long
flowing
gown
covered
with
the
signs
of
the
zodiac
walked
to
the
side
and
whispered
in
his
ear
are
ye
sure
whispered
certain
your
majesty
answered
the
man
the
court
astrologer
announced
the
king
to
the
people
tells
me
that
billy
bounce
star
predicts
that
anyone
who
kills
him
will
himself
be
hanged
then
i
be
hanged
if
i
do
cried
the
executioner
throwing
down
his
meat
cleaver
illustration
what
are
we
to
do
with
him
then
said
the
king
scratching
his
head
i
do
want
to
keep
him
here
or
he
will
eat
me
out
of
house
and
home
i
know
what
boys
are
let
me
go
your
majesty
cried
billy
hopefully
and
lose
twice
the
national
debt
oh
no
has
anyone
else
any
suggestions
to
make
let
me
cast
his
horoscope
again
sire
maybe
the
stars
will
show
us
a
way
out
said
the
astrologer
good
said
begin
at
once
by
daylight
why
of
course
you
can
see
better
by
day
do
not
argue
but
away
and
off
the
astrologer
trotted
shaking
his
head
in
perplexity
billy
felt
barker
stirring
uneasily
in
his
pocket
and
in
order
to
shift
his
position
took
him
out
into
his
arms
as
soon
as
saw
him
he
said
ho
a
dog
this
changes
things
astrologer
include
the
dog
star
in
your
calculations
billy
had
been
idly
scraping
his
foot
on
the
dirty
floor
so
that
he
really
had
made
a
little
hole
there
when
greatly
to
his
surprise
barker
wriggled
out
of
his
arms
and
barked
into
the
hole
up
sprang
the
singing
tree
and
at
once
began
to
sing
in
a
soft
dreamy
voice
a
sleep
song
a
strange
and
sudden
silence
fell
over
the
room
sank
back
onto
his
throne
and
closed
his
eyes
while
a
contented
smile
came
over
his
face
swash
buckler
hand
dropped
from
billy
arm
his
head
nodded
and
he
fell
in
a
heap
so
it
was
throughout
the
palace
slumber
overpowered
all
who
heard
the
song
excepting
billy
and
barker
in
a
moment
all
that
billy
heard
was
the
singing
tree
and
a
loud
chorus
of
snores
you
can
imagine
that
it
did
take
him
long
to
run
out
of
the
door
with
barker
in
his
arms
and
jump
away
from
the
land
of
the
comic
paper
irish
king
chapter
xiii
billy
plays
a
trick
on
boreas
it
cold
said
billy
the
next
morning
when
he
arose
if
my
suit
were
not
full
of
hot
air
i
believe
i
should
freeze
i
wish
though
i
had
some
warm
things
to
put
on
it
looks
like
snow
and
he
swung
his
arms
and
blew
on
his
blue
fingers
and
rubbed
the
tip
of
his
nose
to
be
sure
it
was
still
there
why
hello
what
this
for
while
he
was
exercising
the
singing
tree
had
sung
softly
by
lo
baby
bunting
papa
gone
to
get
a
little
rabbit
skin
to
wrap
his
baby
bunting
in
and
now
stood
holding
a
complete
suit
of
nice
heavy
warm
rabbit
skins
either
baby
bunting
was
a
very
large
baby
or
when
papa
had
skinned
the
rabbit
which
must
have
been
a
giant
one
he
found
it
much
too
large
for
baby
bunting
however
that
may
be
billy
jumped
into
it
in
a
jiffy
and
found
that
it
fitted
him
to
perfection
and
what
a
fine
time
barker
had
with
it
he
crouched
low
and
then
with
yelps
of
delight
jumped
up
and
down
on
billy
legs
he
was
playing
that
he
had
sighted
a
great
big
rabbit
and
billy
joined
in
by
running
around
the
tree
and
back
and
forth
with
barker
in
hot
pursuit
finally
billy
stowed
him
away
warmly
inside
and
doggy
went
sound
asleep
very
very
much
contented
then
with
a
leap
billy
was
off
billy
had
not
been
away
from
the
earth
very
long
when
a
snowflake
lit
on
his
nose
then
another
and
another
until
they
came
down
so
thick
and
fast
that
he
could
not
see
a
foot
ahead
of
him
which
strange
for
his
feet
were
under
him
my
my
he
said
laughing
mother
goose
must
be
picking
a
whole
flock
of
geese
gracious
i
glad
dear
old
singing
tree
gave
me
this
nice
suit
it
as
warm
as
toast
and
keeps
out
the
snow
better
than
a
whole
store
full
of
umbrellas
and
mackintoshes
and
the
snow
fell
thicker
and
faster
while
it
grew
colder
and
colder
but
billy
did
mind
that
for
he
was
nice
and
warm
then
the
snow
suddenly
stopped
and
looking
beneath
him
billy
saw
a
great
white
field
of
snow
with
here
and
there
mountains
of
ice
and
occasional
patches
of
blue
water
and
there
by
the
water
edge
sat
a
white
bear
indeed
he
seemed
almost
to
be
sitting
in
the
water
so
close
to
the
edge
was
he
his
face
turned
toward
the
land
as
soon
as
billy
struck
the
ground
which
he
did
within
a
few
feet
of
the
bear
he
recognized
him
as
an
old
old
friend
fuzzy
white
why
hello
fuzzy
white
what
are
you
doing
here
fishing
said
fuzzy
do
talk
please
i
just
had
a
nibble
where
your
line
asked
billy
in
surprise
for
he
could
see
any
line
or
pole
and
certainly
fuzzy
was
not
faced
the
right
way
for
fishing
so
far
as
billy
could
see
sh
h
said
fuzzy
raising
a
paw
in
warning
there
i
got
him
and
turning
around
quickly
he
showed
a
can
of
sardines
clinging
tightly
to
his
button
of
a
tail
is
that
your
line
asked
billy
certainly
line
bait
and
pole
it
gets
cold
sometimes
hanging
tail
in
the
water
for
an
hour
or
two
but
one
must
eat
but
that
a
can
of
sardines
said
billy
yes
and
i
hope
they
are
the
best
french
with
pure
olive
oil
this
is
a
good
season
for
the
fine
sardine
cans
to
bite
though
the
big
maine
mustard
variety
are
very
easy
to
catch
these
are
the
good
ones
and
fuzzy
with
great
eagerness
opened
the
can
with
his
claw
and
gulped
down
the
contents
do
you
really
catch
canned
sardines
of
course
i
ca
bear
raw
fish
i
suppose
that
from
living
in
civilization
so
long
i
find
that
a
little
lemon
juice
on
my
tail
makes
the
canned
varieties
bite
splendidly
how
wonderful
murmured
billy
well
well
billy
bounce
what
have
you
been
doing
with
yourself
since
i
saw
you
last
how
you
grown
i
been
pretty
well
i
thank
you
what
are
you
doing
now
nothing
much
said
fuzzy
sadly
i
came
up
here
to
go
in
the
ice
business
but
i
found
that
old
boreas
was
the
ice
man
and
had
a
corner
on
the
market
so
i
just
looking
about
for
something
to
turn
up
what
are
you
doing
i
carrying
a
message
to
bogie
man
said
billy
you
nearly
there
then
said
fuzzy
pointing
out
over
the
ice
fields
it
just
beyond
aurora
borealis
and
back
again
ten
thousand
miles
back
again
ten
thousand
miles
is
that
pretty
far
not
very
they
are
imaginary
miles
much
shorter
than
the
regular
kind
who
is
that
whistling
interrupted
billy
that
old
boreas
he
must
have
just
made
a
good
deal
in
ice
and
is
whistling
over
it
by
the
way
he
a
good
friend
to
bogie
man
and
nickel
plate
then
he
no
friend
of
mine
i
should
fear
him
said
fuzzy
he
a
fearful
and
though
he
certainly
cold
blooded
he
makes
more
noise
than
anything
else
talking
about
me
were
you
said
boreas
arriving
in
a
swirl
of
snow
and
clicking
the
ice
tongs
he
held
in
his
hand
we
we
merely
mentioned
your
name
said
billy
trying
to
turn
his
back
on
him
but
that
was
useless
for
old
boreas
faced
him
whichever
way
he
turned
you
ca
escape
me
that
way
and
he
threw
a
handful
of
snow
in
billy
face
stop
it
cried
billy
it
no
joke
to
treat
a
fellow
this
way
of
course
it
is
said
boreas
jumping
over
billy
head
is
what
asked
billy
snow
joke
of
course
i
feel
frisky
this
morning
and
i
must
have
my
joke
you
always
frisky
said
fuzzy
white
sulkily
who
would
be
i
just
exchanged
my
old
bicycle
for
an
icicle
this
morning
and
it
works
like
a
charm
said
boreas
i
suppose
you
travel
rather
fast
said
billy
hoping
to
keep
his
mind
off
of
nickel
plate
and
bogie
man
illustration
talking
about
me
were
you
said
boreas
arriving
in
a
swirl
page
fast
answered
boreas
puffing
his
chest
way
out
fast
why
while
you
are
jumping
three
miles
i
will
have
run
a
hundred
that
blowing
murmured
fuzzy
white
then
you
recognize
me
said
billy
of
course
i
do
south
wind
blew
in
here
one
day
and
warned
me
that
you
were
coming
let
change
the
subject
said
fuzzy
white
nervously
yes
said
billy
eagerly
you
you
whistle
very
well
mr
boreas
i
pride
myself
on
my
whistling
said
boreas
lifting
up
a
block
of
ice
with
his
tongs
and
throwing
it
over
his
shoulder
but
to
return
to
yourself
billy
bounce
you
will
have
to
go
back
home
i
like
to
oblige
you
said
billy
sturdily
but
i
ca
oh
you
ca
ca
you
we
see
about
that
and
boreas
ran
actively
around
billy
cuffing
him
in
the
face
and
over
the
ears
it
seemed
a
thousand
places
all
at
once
whistling
dismally
all
the
time
look
out
for
his
teeth
shouted
fuzzy
white
if
you
once
get
in
the
teeth
of
the
wind
he
will
bite
your
nose
and
ears
and
fingers
and
toes
off
now
do
you
think
better
of
it
said
boreas
coming
to
a
sudden
stop
that
was
only
half
trying
next
time
i
catch
you
in
my
ice
tongs
and
carry
you
home
you
ca
frighten
me
said
billy
patting
fuzzy
white
on
the
head
he
did
know
quite
why
but
the
feel
of
something
that
was
friendly
seemed
to
keep
his
courage
up
go
it
old
boy
whispered
fuzzy
encouragingly
howled
boreas
you
say
i
ca
frighten
you
why
i
frightened
little
boys
and
girls
all
my
life
every
winter
i
howl
and
whistle
my
way
around
the
world
and
the
way
i
make
the
branches
creak
and
the
windows
rattle
through
the
long
dark
nights
is
a
caution
why
even
bogie
man
says
that
next
to
him
i
the
greatest
frightener
in
the
world
i
do
care
i
not
afraid
of
you
said
billy
which
i
fear
was
not
quite
the
exact
truth
for
he
did
feel
very
easy
when
he
looked
at
boreas
long
sparkling
white
teeth
and
his
tousled
gray
head
and
beard
nor
am
i
even
though
you
have
got
a
corner
on
the
ice
market
said
fuzzy
white
for
really
you
know
you
are
an
ice
man
this
made
boreas
furious
he
stormed
and
howled
and
spluttered
and
beat
billy
wildly
on
the
chest
caught
hold
of
him
even
and
spun
him
round
and
round
on
the
ice
but
he
could
knock
him
down
nor
lift
him
off
his
feet
so
long
as
billy
did
not
try
to
jump
you
get
out
of
breath
if
you
keep
that
up
much
longer
said
billy
plucking
up
courage
when
he
saw
that
boreas
could
not
really
do
him
much
damage
but
it
was
a
fatal
speech
for
with
one
loud
yell
boreas
leaped
at
billy
face
and
tried
to
fasten
his
tongs
in
his
nose
it
was
a
trying
moment
for
billy
he
felt
his
nose
turn
pale
with
fright
and
when
boreas
tongs
touched
it
it
grew
absolutely
numb
indeed
he
had
given
his
poor
nose
up
for
lost
and
it
would
surely
have
been
if
fuzzy
white
had
not
scooped
up
a
paw
full
of
snow
and
clapped
it
on
billy
nose
just
as
boreas
began
to
clamp
the
tongs
ou
screamed
boreas
jumping
back
ow
ow
i
ca
bite
through
snow
and
he
turned
somersault
after
somersault
on
the
ice
in
his
fury
thank
you
fuzzy
cried
billy
as
he
felt
the
blood
return
to
his
nose
you
have
saved
me
old
fellow
that
nothing
i
know
his
tricks
better
than
you
do
billy
anxiously
felt
his
nose
with
his
fingers
and
found
it
all
there
and
quite
right
but
i
get
you
yet
billy
bounce
howled
boreas
and
when
i
do
i
nip
you
hard
you
not
so
very
fast
or
dangerous
after
all
said
billy
laughing
look
out
for
him
whispered
fuzzy
he
has
other
tricks
and
sure
enough
along
raced
boreas
this
time
close
to
the
ground
and
before
billy
knew
it
he
had
caught
him
by
the
legs
and
was
sliding
him
along
the
ice
right
toward
the
cold
water
but
billy
knew
a
trick
worth
two
of
that
and
suddenly
threw
himself
backwards
plump
he
had
fallen
back
right
on
top
of
boreas
ugh
cried
boreas
and
lay
still
for
a
moment
with
the
breath
quite
knocked
out
of
him
good
for
billy
cried
fuzzy
white
you
got
him
that
time
so
it
seems
said
billy
laughing
wait
until
i
get
you
up
in
the
air
grunted
boreas
i
show
you
something
then
you
have
been
trying
pretty
hard
all
morning
answered
billy
but
you
have
shown
me
much
yet
my
my
my
how
furious
this
made
boreas
he
raged
and
tore
around
and
above
billy
and
fuzzy
white
but
they
lay
close
to
the
ground
and
though
he
gave
them
some
pretty
hard
kicks
he
could
not
budge
them
if
he
keeps
this
up
he
will
tire
himself
out
laughed
fuzzy
to
billy
he
getting
to
be
a
pretty
old
man
for
such
violent
exercise
and
the
first
thing
he
knows
his
wind
will
give
out
i
like
to
stand
up
though
said
billy
i
afraid
i
catch
cold
catch
cold
cried
boreas
stopping
suddenly
catch
cold
why
you
could
catch
anything
that
all
you
know
about
it
said
billy
i
tell
you
what
i
do
panted
boreas
i
give
you
a
start
of
a
hundred
ice
floes
and
beat
you
down
to
that
iceberg
two
miles
away
done
cried
billy
winking
at
fuzzy
but
i
be
generous
i
give
you
the
start
what
shall
we
bet
asked
boreas
i
do
bet
said
billy
well
we
will
do
this
if
i
catch
you
you
must
give
up
searching
for
bogie
man
if
i
do
you
may
continue
your
journey
and
boreas
chuckled
to
himself
for
he
intended
putting
squall
one
of
his
children
in
billy
way
so
that
he
could
jump
any
distance
at
all
come
here
squall
he
whispered
softly
screech
i
am
here
cried
squall
gaily
settling
down
at
his
side
when
that
boy
jumps
blow
him
in
just
the
opposite
direction
than
that
in
which
i
am
going
yes
sir
the
opposite
direction
you
say
answered
squall
yes
then
calling
to
billy
he
said
are
you
ready
now
billy
had
heard
just
enough
to
know
that
boreas
was
planning
some
trickery
so
he
decided
quickly
how
to
fool
him
all
ready
answered
billy
whispering
to
fuzzy
white
then
go
cried
boreas
and
was
off
go
cried
billy
turning
his
back
on
boreas
and
jumping
in
exactly
the
direction
and
away
toward
aurora
borealis
now
squall
did
not
know
any
more
than
his
father
had
told
him
so
of
course
he
got
right
back
of
billy
and
pushed
him
faster
than
ever
away
from
his
father
making
him
fairly
hum
through
the
air
you
can
imagine
how
surprised
boreas
was
when
he
reached
the
iceberg
and
turning
around
to
see
how
far
he
had
beaten
billy
found
that
he
was
sailing
way
way
off
away
from
him
with
squall
pushing
him
along
with
all
his
might
and
main
he
was
furious
come
back
come
back
he
called
to
squall
and
the
boy
turned
back
obediently
to
meet
his
father
he
has
not
escaped
me
yet
cried
boreas
jumping
after
billy
and
it
is
very
doubtful
indeed
if
he
would
have
escaped
had
squall
not
been
so
anxious
to
do
just
what
his
father
said
for
back
he
came
with
his
head
down
and
his
eyes
shut
going
as
fast
as
he
could
boreas
too
had
closed
his
eyes
when
he
jumped
after
billy
and
so
neither
knew
that
the
other
was
near
until
they
went
bump
right
into
each
other
ouch
ugh
they
cried
and
fell
to
the
ground
the
breath
knocked
completely
out
of
them
and
so
billy
sailed
far
far
away
toward
aurora
borealis
and
safe
from
boreas
and
squall
chapter
xiv
king
calcium
and
sterry
optican
what
a
dazzling
sight
was
the
town
of
aurora
borealis
when
it
broke
on
billy
vision
sparkling
blue
red
and
golden
houses
cut
out
of
solid
icebergs
even
the
poorest
huts
shone
with
all
the
colors
of
the
rainbow
in
the
wavering
flickering
light
that
rose
and
fell
on
them
when
billy
alighted
in
the
streets
he
stood
amazed
at
the
beauty
surrounding
him
but
when
he
saw
the
magnificent
ice
palace
that
stood
directly
in
front
of
him
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
higher
than
the
highest
office
building
he
had
ever
seen
in
the
city
wider
than
the
longest
block
he
had
ever
walked
and
more
brilliant
in
its
changing
colors
than
any
kaleidoscope
he
had
ever
looked
into
phew
he
said
with
a
great
sigh
of
enjoyment
that
a
beauty
sure
enough
not
bad
is
it
said
a
voice
at
his
elbow
looking
around
billy
saw
a
funny
little
chap
with
sharp
bright
eyes
a
short
pinched
blue
little
nose
and
long
tapering
fingers
in
one
hand
he
carried
an
maulstick
and
in
the
other
a
palette
and
brushes
it
is
beautiful
said
billy
can
you
tell
me
what
place
it
is
the
ice
palace
i
built
it
are
you
a
contractor
asked
billy
no
i
an
expander
a
what
an
expander
frost
expands
i
jack
frost
architect
artist
and
ice
bridge
builder
you
must
enjoy
the
work
yes
i
fond
of
water
colors
i
suppose
you
seen
some
of
my
pictures
and
hung
in
your
own
house
yes
sir
you
must
be
a
lightning
sketch
artist
never
have
been
out
when
it
lightened
i
afraid
of
thunder
i
did
mean
that
began
billy
you
must
learn
to
say
what
you
mean
interrupted
jack
frost
because
if
you
should
get
the
habit
of
not
meaning
what
you
say
no
one
could
say
what
you
meant
whether
you
meant
it
or
not
that
clear
is
it
not
exactly
said
billy
perhaps
you
understand
this
better
seeing
is
believing
but
believing
is
not
seeing
unless
you
believe
you
see
and
so
seeing
believe
what
you
see
how
that
i
suppose
it
very
true
indeed
answered
billy
politely
but
he
was
certainly
at
sea
as
to
what
jack
frost
was
talking
about
not
a
bit
of
it
what
the
good
of
telling
the
truth
when
an
untruth
is
more
interesting
i
do
agree
with
you
said
billy
no
sun
ever
does
i
suppose
you
somebody
son
yes
sir
i
my
mother
son
at
this
jack
frost
wept
little
icicles
saying
poor
me
poor
me
an
orphan
an
orphan
said
billy
that
is
too
bad
how
old
are
you
only
a
million
years
mother
died
when
i
was
born
and
i
sometimes
feel
so
young
and
helpless
without
a
mother
to
spank
me
billy
thought
this
rather
silly
but
did
not
like
to
say
so
for
jack
frost
seemed
to
take
it
all
very
seriously
now
that
over
said
jack
suddenly
looking
up
in
billy
face
and
smiling
i
just
wanted
to
show
you
that
i
was
a
man
of
sentiment
suppose
we
go
into
the
ice
palace
and
have
a
little
light
refreshment
that
would
be
nice
said
billy
a
little
for
instance
that
sounds
cold
it
tastes
colder
said
jack
frost
putting
his
arm
through
billy
come
along
and
if
that
not
enough
you
can
have
a
glass
of
ugh
how
the
thought
of
the
cold
things
made
billy
shiver
and
how
like
a
cake
of
ice
jack
frost
arm
was
i
i
thank
you
very
much
he
faltered
but
if
you
just
as
soon
sooner
said
jack
frost
what
is
it
i
do
think
i
care
for
anything
to
eat
oh
but
you
must
have
something
to
cool
you
up
you
take
your
death
of
warmness
if
you
go
into
the
heat
without
a
cup
of
cold
coffee
to
keep
out
the
warm
and
billy
allowed
himself
to
be
dragged
along
for
fear
that
if
he
refused
further
jack
frost
would
think
of
something
colder
to
give
him
are
you
allowed
to
enter
the
palace
whenever
you
wish
asked
billy
i
do
have
to
wish
i
just
go
in
who
lives
here
the
calcium
king
and
his
daughter
sterry
optican
she
an
actress
an
actress
exclaimed
billy
yes
she
a
cold
proud
beauty
but
the
king
rules
us
with
a
light
hand
here
we
are
and
jack
frost
led
billy
through
the
ice
palace
gates
who
are
those
men
asked
billy
pointing
to
two
tall
soldierly
looking
men
who
stood
at
either
side
of
the
gate
with
huge
in
their
hands
the
ice
guard
whispered
jack
frost
all
picked
men
let
me
introduce
you
to
calcium
king
billy
looked
about
him
but
could
see
no
one
but
an
old
man
seated
at
the
window
behind
a
great
reflector
and
two
things
such
as
they
have
at
the
theatre
to
throw
a
bright
light
on
the
stage
the
machine
was
buzzing
and
sizzing
away
and
the
old
man
was
turning
the
light
this
way
and
that
out
over
the
streets
and
houses
and
whichever
way
it
turned
a
thousand
flames
of
golden
light
shone
in
the
heavens
and
made
the
houses
sparkle
and
sparkle
again
with
brilliant
colors
billy
knew
then
where
the
northern
lights
came
from
where
the
king
whispered
billy
that
he
answered
jack
pointing
to
the
old
man
the
lord
high
master
of
the
lime
lights
is
sick
in
bed
with
a
warm
in
his
head
and
the
king
is
attending
to
things
himself
then
aloud
hello
king
good
midnight
answered
the
king
without
turning
around
i
want
you
to
meet
my
friend
said
jack
frost
where
do
you
want
me
to
meet
him
asked
the
king
do
make
it
very
far
away
because
i
ca
trust
the
machine
to
anyone
else
illustration
me
feyther
cried
she
in
a
tragic
voice
the
light
the
light
page
he
is
here
said
jack
oh
well
then
i
meet
him
half
way
and
jumping
quickly
up
the
king
ran
to
billy
shook
his
hand
murmured
how
de
do
and
trotted
back
to
his
machine
glad
to
know
you
king
said
billy
you
do
know
me
replied
the
king
i
do
even
know
myself
so
how
could
a
fat
boy
who
has
just
shaken
my
hand
expect
to
know
me
i
do
know
said
billy
that
better
where
is
my
daughter
jack
i
do
know
your
calciumness
answered
jack
frost
but
even
as
he
spoke
a
tall
handsome
young
woman
with
hair
and
large
blue
eyes
came
slowly
into
the
room
me
feyther
cried
she
in
a
tragic
voice
the
light
the
light
and
immediately
the
king
turned
a
small
calcium
light
directly
on
her
bowing
and
kissing
her
hand
she
turned
to
billy
whither
goest
thou
fair
sir
and
whence
comest
thou
answer
i
prithee
was
all
billy
could
say
in
his
amazement
she
means
where
are
you
going
and
where
did
you
come
from
whispered
jack
in
billy
ear
why
could
she
say
so
then
grumbled
billy
goest
thou
henceford
or
thenceford
fair
sir
fain
would
i
know
or
wilt
thou
tarry
awhile
and
let
me
pour
into
thine
ear
billy
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
and
stepped
back
in
a
hurry
please
do
pour
anything
into
my
ears
she
means
she
wants
to
talk
to
you
whispered
jack
again
stage
talk
ay
such
is
indeed
the
truth
said
sterry
optican
moving
forward
followed
closely
by
the
light
this
time
billy
stood
his
ground
and
she
took
his
hand
in
hers
saying
sadly
would
thou
wert
not
so
fat
fair
sir
else
could
i
learn
ay
gladly
learn
to
love
you
but
hold
villain
unhand
me
and
she
flung
hand
away
from
her
and
burst
into
sobs
jack
frost
said
billy
wildly
for
goodness
sake
pinch
me
i
know
whether
i
asleep
or
crazy
nay
nay
curfew
not
ring
cried
sterry
optican
seizing
billy
by
his
hair
and
dragging
him
up
and
down
the
room
while
she
did
this
the
king
and
jack
frost
clapped
their
hands
loudly
and
cried
bravo
bravo
you
do
it
better
every
day
cried
jack
my
my
wo
people
stare
when
you
really
do
go
on
the
stage
and
to
think
that
she
my
daughter
said
the
king
proudly
oh
was
that
just
play
asked
billy
relieved
but
very
sore
about
the
scalp
for
sterry
had
not
been
gentle
yes
was
it
grand
said
she
sitting
down
i
have
been
on
the
stage
long
ago
i
mean
really
on
the
stage
you
know
and
acting
for
real
stage
money
but
there
so
much
jealousy
in
the
profession
that
i
ca
seem
to
get
a
hearing
that
too
bad
said
billy
sympathetically
what
do
theatre
managers
say
to
your
acting
just
what
you
said
that
it
too
bad
but
my
friends
all
say
i
just
grand
and
by
all
means
should
go
on
the
stage
father
you
may
turn
off
the
light
now
i
through
thank
goodness
murmured
billy
to
himself
what
did
you
say
whispered
jack
frost
i
was
talking
to
myself
said
billy
that
a
waste
of
time
though
i
suppose
you
more
interested
in
your
conversation
than
any
one
else
that
sarcastic
no
it
true
said
jack
do
you
think
i
clever
you
what
i
would
call
a
sharp
frost
said
billy
laughing
stop
talking
for
a
minute
interrupted
king
calcium
i
not
talking
said
sterry
optican
i
thinking
and
it
much
harder
to
think
than
to
talk
it
is
for
some
people
said
jack
now
as
for
me
be
silent
cried
the
king
nickel
plate
is
trying
to
signal
me
nickel
plate
exclaimed
billy
rising
to
his
feet
yes
said
the
king
do
you
know
him
i
met
him
said
billy
but
excuse
me
good
day
night
you
mean
it
wo
be
day
for
six
months
interrupted
jack
frost
good
night
then
i
really
must
be
going
not
until
you
carved
your
initials
on
the
north
pole
said
sterry
optican
it
my
autograph
album
you
know
and
i
have
the
names
and
initials
of
many
famous
people
on
it
why
even
my
own
is
there
thank
you
very
much
said
billy
nervously
but
i
really
ca
spare
the
time
that
all
you
know
about
the
north
pole
said
jack
you
could
stay
there
a
year
and
not
be
spending
a
minute
what
do
you
mean
asked
billy
in
surprise
just
what
i
say
this
time
how
are
days
hours
minutes
and
seconds
measured
answer
me
that
by
the
length
of
time
it
takes
a
given
point
to
completely
revolve
about
the
earth
axis
answered
billy
not
quite
sure
that
this
was
the
exact
definition
but

billy
and
if
you
ca
revolve
around
it
you
ca
measure
time
can
you
no
and
if
you
ca
measure
time
then
there
is
no
time
so
you
see
you
ca
waste
time
or
spend
time
when

on
the
north
pole
i
hope

billy
dubiously

the
pole

pleaded
sterry
and
billy
was
just
about
to
yield
indeed
he
had
taken
two
steps
toward
the
door
when
king
calcium
suddenly
exclaimed
hold
jack

doors

discovered

our
mongst
cried
jack
blowing
on
the
doors
and
freezing
them
tight
shut
not
the
real
billy
cried
sterry
walking
over
to
a
sofa
and
preparing
to
faint
yes
cried
the
king
it
is

nickel
plate

wigwagged

sterry
throwing
herself
carefully

the
sofa

the

said
jack
dancing
away
out
of
billy
reach

nervous
child

cried
the
king
tottering
over
to
billy
and
laying
his
hand
on
his
collar
jack
call
the
ice
guard
ice
guard

shouted
jack
lem

cried
billy
or

no
you
wo
panted
the
king
clinging
desperately
to
billy
you
see
said
billy
and
began
to
drag
the
king
over
to
the
window
where
the
calcium
was
burning
brightly
help
me
help
me
jack
called
the
king
trying
to
sit
down
on
the
floor
but
billy
kept
him
from
doing
so
and
finally
reached
the
window
quick
as
a
flash
he
turned
the
entire
northern
light
right
into
the
room
and
with
a
sizzle
splash
puff
the
ice
doors
went
up
in
steam
the
next
moment
he
found
the
lever
that
controlled
the
lamp
and
zip
the
light
was
out
my
my
my
but
how
dark
it
got
darker
than
a
thousand
nights
blacker
than
a
million
hats
the
king
let
go
of
billy
collar
and
commenced
wildly
to
grope
for
the
machine
now
to
escape
cried
billy
barker
lead
me
out
by
scent
and
quickly
he
pulled
barker
out
of
his
pocket
tied
a
string
to
his
collar
and
turned
him
loose
barker
gave
one
little
yelp
and
then
darted
for
the
doorway
with
billy
hot
after
him
out
they
ran
into
the
open
air
and
picking
barker
up
in
his
arms
up
jumped
billy
away
from
aurora
borealis
chapter
xv
billy
meets
glucose
to
say
that
billy
was
glad
to
see
real
sunshine
and
feel
its
warmth
again
hardly
expresses
his
joy
when
on
emerging
from
aurora
borealis
he
floated
into
a
warmer
climate
and
the
next
time
his
feet
touched
earth
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
take
off
his
rabbit
skin
and
give
it
back
to
the
singing
tree
and
then
how
he
and
barker
rolled
on
the
soft
green
grass
breathed
in
the
sweet
air
and
basked
in
the
sunlight
you
saved
my
life
old
boy
said
billy
patting
barker
head
and
barker
wagged
his
little
tail
and
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
as
much
as
to
say
i
glad
and
i
would
do
it
again
if
i
had
the
opportunity
billy
bounce
and
now
off
we
go
said
billy
thrusting
barker
into
his
pocket
and
jumping
up
into
the
air
illustration
in
now
it
is
hard
to
say
just
exactly
how
it
happened
whether
barker
slipped
out
of
billy
pocket
or
just
climbed
out
thinking
that
he
too
could
float
in
the
air
i
do
not
know
at
any
rate
the
first
thing
billy
knew
there
was
a
sharp
jerk
on
the
string
that
barker
was
tied
to
a
frightened
yelp
and
there
was
doggie
being
dragged
up
and
up
through
the
air
by
his
collar
of
course
it
did
not
take
billy
a
minute
to
haul
barker
up
to
him
and
to
catch
him
in
his
arms
but
even
then
it
was
none
too
soon
for
in
another
moment
there
would
have
been
no
more
barker
poor
old
fellow
cried
billy
snuggling
him
up
in
his
arms
your
dog
days
were
nearly
ended
that
time
were
they
and
he
was
still
soothing
and
patting
barker
when
his
feet
crashed
through
a
jungle
of
blades
and
stalks
and
he
found
himself
in
an
enormous
corn
field
he
looked
about
him
and
saw
dimly
ahead
through
the
corn
a
factory
building
at
least
he
took
it
for
this
for
he
could
hear
the
distant
hum
of
machinery
and
the
of
an
engine
now
i
wonder
where
i
am
said
billy
beginning
to
walk
toward
the
factory
stop
or
you
are
a
dead
man
or
boy
said
a
voice
at
his
side
illustration
the
boy
turning
billy
found
himself
looking
down
the
barrel
of
a
cap
pistol
but
not
being
particularly
interested
in
what
he
saw
there
he
looked
further
and
discovered
the
face
of
its
owner
on
his
head
was
a
very
very
large
wig
of
raveled
rope
and
attached
to
his
chin
by
large
elastic
bands
that
ran
over
his
ears
was
a
heavily
matted
blue
beard
following
the
beard
to
its
end
billy
eyes
traveled
on
down
to
a
large
tin
star
who
are
you
asked
billy
in
surprise
snawksnaw
the
famous
boy
detecative
cried
the
boy
pulling
off
beard
and
wig
with
one
sweep
of
his
hand
and
folding
his
arms
dramatically
what
do
you
detect
asked
billy
hist
said
the
boy
again
putting
on
the
wig
and
beard
and
pointing
the
cap
pistol
at
him
hist
i
detect
crime
but
move
not
or
i
will
your
out
is
that
a
disguise
asked
billy
pointing
to
the
boy
detective
hair
and
beard
it
is
and
a
perfect
one
who
would
ever
guess
that
snawksnaw
the
famous
boy
detecative
and
this
bearded
ruffian
were
one
and
the
same
person
this
is
my
favorite
transform
but
why
did
you
get
a
blue
beard
that
is
the
completest
part
of
the
disguise
for
though
they
might
guess
that
i
would
raise
a
black
beard
or
a
yellow
one
or
a
red
one
would
think
that
i
could
raise
a
blue
one
then
scowling
terribly
he
hissed
are
you
one
of
them
one
of
whom
asked
billy
one
of
the
party
of
desperate
men
that
inhabit
yon
fair
but
foul
factory
of
course
not
i
just
arrived
then
perhaps
you
too
are
a
detecative
on
the
same
trail
but
i
warn
you
snawksnaw
will
have
no
partner
to
share
the
glory
of
this
capture
i
have
run
them
to
earth
and
mean
to
take
them
single
handed
what
have
they
done
asked
billy
i
know
not
that
i
will
find
out
when
i
have
bound
and
gagged
them
then
you
do
know
them
yes
and
snawksnaw
seeing
no
immediate
use
for
his
pistol
carefully
put
it
in
his
hip
pocket
after
examining
the
cap
to
see
that
it
was
still
in
place
nothing
like
being
sure
of
one
firearms
he
said
for
should
me
trusty
miss
fire
at
a
critical
moment
i
should
be
in
a
dangerous
position
who
are
they
nickel
plate
the
polished
villain
what
cried
billy
nickel
plate
yes
and
bumbus
bumbus
yes
and
drone
drone
i
do
know
him
he
a
cowardly
ruffian
the
tool
of
nickel
plate
a
sort
of
nickel
plated
tool
said
billy
laughing
i
suppose
so
said
snawksnaw
seriously
missing
the
joke
and
worst
of
all
their
fair
but
false
accomplice
glucose
possessing
a
beautiful
face
to
look
upon
but
with
the
crafty
crawling
venomous
wiles
of
the
serpent
i
heard
of
glucose
said
billy
she
is
the
one
they
tried
to
put
in
honey
girl
place
at
the
bee
palace
cried
snawksnaw
a
case
of
abduction
but
i
will
foil
them
it
shall
be
my
greatest
shadow
i
must
perfect
my
disguise
in
such
a
serious
case
and
taking
off
his
coat
he
turned
it
inside
out
and
struggled
into
it
now
i
defy
them
you
not
going
to
the
factory
are
you
asked
billy
i
do
know
if
i
just
knew
what
old
sneuth
the
detective
would
do
under
the
circumstances
i
could
decide
huh
i
should
wait
for
that
said
a
voice
looking
up
billy
and
snawksnaw
saw
bumbus
leaning
against
a
cornstalk
wearing
a
very
but
wicked
grin
so
it
my
old
friend
billy
bounce
continued
he
bumbus
was
all
billy
could
say
i
be
said
bumbus
who
your
friend
snawksnaw
the
famous
boy
detecative
shouted
that
youth
drawing
his
cap
pistol
but
i
shall
sell
my
life
dearly
and
he
snapped
the
cap
at
bumbus
how
it
did
make
bumbus
jump
but
instead
of
falling
dead
in
his
tracks
as
they
do
in
dime
novels
he
seized
billy
collar
with
one
hand
and
reached
for
the
boy
detective
collar
with
the
other
missed
cried
snawksnaw
throwing
his
pistol
to
the
ground
ten
thousand
furies
i
do
know
what
old
sneuth
would
do
now
but
i
know
what
i
going
to
do
and
he
ran
off
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
good
riddance
said
bumbus
laughing
which
proves
beyond
a
doubt
that
the
wicked
flourish
like
a
green
bay
rum
tree
how
is
that
asked
billy
meaning
that
no
matter
how
close
the
shave
green
bay
rum
can
face
it
i
suppose
you
are
going
to
take
me
prisoner
to
the
factory
said
billy
wishing
to
have
the
worst
over
as
soon
as
possible
my
my
but
you
are
a
good
guesser
then
calling
loudly
nickel
plate
drone
here
is
billy
bounce
laughed
nickel
plate
striding
through
the
corn
so
billy
bounce
is
once
more
in
our
power
eh
this
time
he
shall
not
escape
us
yawned
a
bee
coming
slowly
out
of
the
factory
come
wake
up
drone
cried
bumbus
yawned
drone
here
billy
thought
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
run
and
giving
a
sharp
twist
he
broke
from
bumbus
and
started
away
to
get
room
to
jump
but
alas
for
his
hopes
the
cornstalks
suddenly
intertwined
their
tops
all
about
and
over
him
and
he
found
himself
again
a
prisoner
how
impolite
laughed
bumbus
how
very
impolite
of
you
to
think
of
going
away
without
saying
to
the
factory
with
him
said
nickel
plate
in
a
loud
voice
and
billy
was
pulled
and
hauled
through
the
cornfield
up
to
the
factory
which
bore
the
sign
nickel
plate
bumbus
and
glucose
inside
past
the
grinding
machinery
and
the
great
vats
of
boiling
syrup
and
finally
thrust
into
a
little
room
marked
office
honey
girl
he
cried
catching
sight
of
a
young
girl
seated
at
the
typewriter
billy
bounce
she
cried
starting
to
her
feet
with
a
peculiar
smile
but
the
sound
of
her
voice
and
something
about
her
eyes
told
him
that
it
was
not
honey
girl
at
all
but
glucose
that
stood
before
him
i
i
beg
your
pardon
he
stammered
i
thought
you
were
the
princess
well
she
said
questioningly
but
i
see
now
i
was
mistaken
you
are
glucose
beware
billy
bounce
how
you
anger
a
woman
hereafter
address
me
as
honey
girl
or
take
the
consequences
so
saying
glucose
closed
down
her
desk
and
hurriedly
left
the
room
i
suppose
i
made
another
enemy
but
i
do
care
she
proved
now
that
she
is
not
honey
girl
and
this
knowledge
may
prove
useful
some
day
billy
was
seated
in
a
chair
near
the
door
when
suddenly
through
the
keyhole
and
above
the
hum
of
machinery
came
the
sound
of
voices
we
must
get
the
note
from
him
and
prevent
his
seeing
bogie
man
said
the
voice
of
bumbus
yes
said
nickel
plate
but
i
fear
that
so
long
as
he
lives
he
will
be
in
our
way
throw
him
in
the
grinder
suggested
drone
or
boil
him
in
a
syrup
vat
added
bumbus
too
sweet
a
death
said
nickel
plate
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
he
must
die
then
their
voices
died
away
showing
that
they
had
moved
off
i
suppose
it
all
up
with
me
said
billy
looking
about
him
for
some
means
of
escape
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
gas
here
i
try
umberufen
perhaps
he
can
carry
the
message
you
can
imagine
that
it
did
not
take
him
long
to
touch
wood
and
zip
umberufen
stood
before
him
well
so
you
need
me
again
do
you
yes
sir
said
billy
the
last
time
you
treated
me
very
badly
i
very
sorry
humph
that
wo
pay
for
a
ruined
suit
of
clothes
everything
i
had
on
warped
dreadfully
but
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
forgive
you
what
is
it
i
want
you
to
carry
a
message
to
mr
gas
out
of
my
district
said
umberufen
curtly
but
you
often
go
to
gas
said
billy
this
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
i
ca
go
to
him
unless
he
touches
wood
but
you
are
supposed
to
do
what
i
ask
you
to
anything
here
yes
but
i
not
an
errand
boy
answered
umberufen
indifferently
have
you
no
heart
exclaimed
billy
certainly
but
gas
did
hire
that
he
just
arranged
for
my
brains
and
ability
then
whatever
he
pays
you
he
got
a
bad
bargain
said
billy
angrily
you
may
go
there
you
go
showing
your
temper
again
goodness
i
would
have
your
disposition
for
anything
and
umberufen
disappeared
i
wish
i
could
sneeze
perhaps
gehsundheit
would
take
the
message
i
try
but
do
what
he
would
billy
could
not
make
himself
sneeze
he
tickled
his
nose
with
a
straw
snuffed
up
dust
did
everything
he
could
think
of
but
not
a
sneeze
would
come
at
last
he
gave
up
in
despair
i
imitate
a
sneeze
cried
he
it
did
not
sound
very
much
like
a
sneeze
but
sure
enough
a
shadowy
form
of
gehsundheit
appeared
before
him
gehsundheit
came
from
the
figure
but
it
sounded
far
far
away
like
an
echo
at
last
cried
billy
oh
gehsundheit
i
need
your
help
so
iss
it
he
whispered
yes
i
want
you
to
carry
a
message
to
mr
gas
alas
it
can
not
be
did
why
not
because
i
am
not
here
not
here
where
are
you
at
home
in
my
castle
but
i
can
see
you
no
it
iss
but
my
shadow
why
did
you
come
yourself
i
sneezed
it
vas
not
a
real
sneeze
so
the
real
gehsundheit
could
not
come
and
slowly
the
form
faded
away
well
what
do
you
think
of
that
exclaimed
billy
as
the
last
of
gehsundheit
vanished
into
thin
air
i
never
think
said
bumbus
suddenly
opening
the
door
why
waste
time
in
thought
when
thoughtlessness
makes
more
trouble
than
villainy
i
do
see
the
point
said
billy
it
has
no
point
it
a
blunt
statement
but
come
along
where
ask
me
no
questions
and
i
tell
you
no
truths
said
bumbus
come
along
i
do
want
to
said
billy
holding
back
before
you
get
much
older
you
do
many
things
you
do
want
to
that
is
if
you
live
to
get
older
by
this
time
drone
had
come
in
and
was
leaning
against
billy
fast
asleep
wake
up
drone
and
help
said
bumbus
oh
said
drone
i
just
dreamed
that
i
was
asleep
that
one
dream
that
came
true
said
bumbus
now
out
with
him
bumbus
pulled
and
drone
pushed
and
although
the
latter
went
to
sleep
three
or
four
times
before
they
got
out
of
the
room
billy
finally
found
himself
in
the
main
factory
where
nickel
plate
was
directing
some
workmen
in
taking
the
lid
off
of
a
vat
ah
ha
said
nickel
plate
when
he
saw
billy
now
boy
i
will
give
you
a
last
chance
promise
that
you
will
give
up
all
search
for
bogie
man
and
return
the
note
to
me
and
we
will
free
you
otherwise
it
will
be
a
case
of
boil
instead
of
freeze
interrupted
bumbus
then
boil
cried
billy
i
must
do
my
duty
while
i
live
in
with
him
cried
nickel
plate
in
with
him
cried
bumbus
yawned
drone
and
with
that
they
lifted
billy
up
and
were
about
to
drop
him
into
the
vat
when
through
the
open
skylight
and
down
in
their
midst
dropped
gas
he
was
seated
in
his
big
which
was
carried
along
by
hundreds
of
toy
balloons
of
all
colors
hold
he
cried
but
instead
of
holding
they
were
all
so
surprised
that
they
let
go
of
billy
and
he
fell
to
the
floor
just
missing
the
vat
by
a
few
inches
luckily
he
lit
on
his
feet
and
of
course
as
this
was
just
the
same
as
a
jump
he
bounded
up
again
and
out
through
the
skylight
followed
by
gas
chapter
xvi
in
spookville
when
they
had
gotten
well
away
from
the
factory
billy
recovered
his
wits
sufficiently
to
thank
gas
warmly
for
his
assistance
you
are
welcome
billy
bounce
it
was
lots
of
fun
for
me
and
i
needed
an
outing
anyway
but
how
did
you
know
about
my
need
said
billy
i
tried
to
send
umberufen
and
gehsundheit
but
could
get
neither
of
them
to
go
the
wireless
telephoneless
telephone
brought
me
your
wish
i
came
very
near
answering
but
you
did
hold
the
wireless
wire
and
i
thought
it
would
be
more
exciting
to
save
you
at
the
last
minute
the
way
they
always
do
in
books
i
afraid
began
billy
do
do
it
interrupted
gas
what
be
afraid
but
i
meant
to
say
i
was
afraid
he
began
again
you
did
say
it
you
did
just
mean
to
say
it
said
gas
severely
well
what
i
meant
was
that
i
did
think
gehsundheit
and
umberufen
have
been
of
much
use
to
me
that
better
never
use
the
word
afraid
because
there
nothing
in
the
world
to
be
afraid
of
if
you
do
your
best
i
remember
that
sir
answered
billy
about
gehsundheit
and
umberufen
they
are
not
very
useful
it
true
but
the
two
old
fellows
have
been
out
of
work
for
so
long
that
i
hire
them
out
of
charity
i
suppose
they
mean
well
oh
yes
but
be
careful
of
well
meaners
unless
they
are
good
doers
that
what
counts
yes
sir
said
billy
and
now
keep
your
teeth
clean
and
do
eat
any
dirt
of
course
not
i
never
do
eat
dirt
i
know
you
do
but
it
is
my
rule
to
give
advice
that
can
be
easily
followed
that
the
way
i
keep
my
friends
and
thank
you
called
billy
and
in
less
than
half
a
jiffy
gas
and
his
toy
balloons
were
only
a
speck
on
the
horizon
when
billy
again
reached
the
earth
it
was
night
he
had
just
taken
barker
out
of
his
pocket
and
was
going
to
dig
a
hole
for
the
singing
tree
when
he
saw
that
he
was
in
a
great
shadowy
city
that
strange
he
said
looking
about
him
i
was
sure
that
i
was
in
the
middle
of
a
green
meadow
when
i
first
came
down
and
here
i
am
in
a
city
and
yet
when
he
looked
again
he
found
that
he
could
see
clear
through
the
houses
this
made
him
just
a
wee
bit
nervous
ah
here
comes
some
one
with
a
lantern
i
ask
him
about
it
and
sure
enough
there
came
bobbing
and
dancing
up
the
street
a
ball
of
light
he
an
awfully
unsteady
walker
whoever
he
is
said
billy
for
one
minute
the
light
would
be
way
up
in
the
air
and
the
next
minute
almost
touching
the
ground
then
it
would
be
on
one
side
of
the
walk
and
again
on
the
other
on
it
came
until
it
was
within
a
few
inches
of
his
nose
and
then
he
saw
that
was
carrying
it
gracious
what
a
start
it
gave
him
for
a
moment
only
and
then
he
was
off
after
it
in
hot
pursuit
but
the
faster
billy
walked
the
faster
the
light
went
when
he
ran
it
ran
and
suddenly
puff
it
disappeared
huh
i
do
like
that
a
little
bit
and
he
stopped
and
looked
around
him
the
moon
cast
a
pale
and
sickly
light
and
the
gaunt
trees
waved
and
creaked
sadly
in
the
moaning
breeze
throwing
long
shadows
on
the
ground
then
a
bird
piped
out
from
the
forest
that
what
it
was
of
course
said
billy
sturdily
sticking
his
fists
into
his
pockets
a
and
back
he
trudged
whistling
as
hard
as
he
could
whistle
because
whistling
keep
a
fellow
courage
up
on
a
lonely
walk
does
it
it
certainly
cheered
billy
a
great
deal
so
that
when
he
got
back
to
the
place
he
had
lately
left
he
was
laughing
at
his
fears
and
then
the
moon
went
under
a
cloud
goodness
it
dark
he
said
half
aloud
is
it
though
whispered
a
voice
right
behind
him
if
billy
had
been
a
wax
figure
on
a
pivot
he
could
not
have
turned
around
quicker
than
he
did
and
then
when
he
turned
he
was
sorry
that
he
had
for
looking
into
his
face
was
a
great
white
flabby
head
on
a
long
wavery
body
it
did
not
seem
to
have
any
eyes
and
yet
billy
felt
them
looking
into
his
it
did
not
seem
to
have
any
mouth
and
yet
billy
had
heard
it
speak
you
say
he
asked
in
a
quavering
voice
and
he
distinctly
felt
each
separate
hair
on
his
head
grow
stiff
as
a
poker
and
his
cap
rise
a
couple
of
inches
from
his
crown
i
said
it
was
dark
what
the
matter
do
you
stammer
usually
said
billy
trying
to
set
his
teeth
and
stop
the
tune
they
were
chattering
then
i
wish
you
stop
it
very
annoying
said
the
figure
chuckling
to
himself
by
a
great
effort
billy
got
his
lower
jaw
under
control
and
said
who
are
you
your
manner
is
familiar
but
i
do
recognize
your
face
oh
i
a
ghost
a
ghost
exclaimed
billy
stepping
back
yes
i
met
you
lots
of
times
said
the
ghost
who
were
you
when
when
you
were
alive
perhaps
if
you
mention
the
name
and
billy
tried
to
recollect
some
of
his
former
friends
i
alive
though
goodness
knows
if
times
keep
up
the
way
going
now
i
ca
tell
how
soon
i
starve
to
death
starve
to
death
yes
times
have
changed
in
the
last
four
hundred
years
why
i
remember
years
ago
we
ghosts
were
busy
on
haunting
jobs
night
after
night
but
now
we
have
to
scratch
pretty
hard
for
a
living
but
where
have
you
met
me
asked
billy
on
your
way
to
bed
when
the
nurse
had
been
telling
you
silly
tales
come
we
old
friends
let
shake
hands
can
can
you
shake
hands
said
billy
putting
his
own
behind
him
certainly
of
course
i
ca
shake
your
hand
but
i
can
shake
my
own
and
with
that
the
ghost
held
two
long
white
arms
in
front
of
him
joined
the
ends
one
really
could
call
them
hands
and
waved
them
up
and
down
much
relieved
billy
clasped
his
own
two
hands
and
feebly
shook
them
and
my
how
cold
and
clammy
they
felt
well
i
must
be
going
said
billy
nervously
do
go
yet
let
talk
over
old
times
and
by
the
way
you
happen
to
know
a
quiet
family
keeping
two
servants
no
children
preferred
who
wants
to
hire
a
respectable
ghost
thoroughly
tame
will
eat
out
of
the
hand
terms
reasonable
and
references
exchanged
guaranteed
to
give
satisfaction
or
money
returned
if
desired
can
take
the
shape
of
an
old
ancestor
guarding
buried
treasure
extra
and
the
ghost
rattled
this
off
as
if
he
had
learned
it
by
heart
illustration
up
to
the
house
and
spend
an
unpleasant
page
no
said
billy
i
really
do
not
in
fact
i
sure
i
do
now
that
too
bad
but
perhaps
you
would
hire
me
i
make
it
cheap
for
old
acquaintance
sake
said
the
ghost
wistfully
no
said
billy
quickly
i
do
think
i
care
to
be
haunted
if
the
price
is
all
that
stands
in
the
way
i
work
for
my
keep
just
to
keep
in
practice
no
said
billy
i
he
was
going
to
say
afraid
but
remembered
gas
advice
and
said
i
sure
i
do
need
you
well
i
suppose
if
you
wo
you
wo
but
anyway
come
up
to
the
house
and
spend
an
unpleasant
evening
i
like
you
to
meet
the
wife
and
children
my
wife
is
a
little
the
ghost
of
a
daughter
but
she
will
thaw
out
after
a
while
and
i
sure
she
can
fix
up
a
nice
little
supper
for
us
i
really
have
not
time
said
billy
backing
off
not
if
i
tell
you
that
we
have
some
cold
fear
pie
and
a
roast
of
imagination
a
neat
little
salad
of
screams
topped
off
with
groan
pudding
come
that
ought
to
tempt
you
and
i
get
the
children
to
do
the
shadow
dance
for
you
after
supper
you
are
very
kind
i
sure
said
billy
but
i
have
a
message
i
must
deliver
to
bogie
man
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
billy
bounce
exclaimed
the
ghost
yes
said
billy
what
have
i
done
oh
me
that
what
comes
of
getting
old
and
i
took
you
for
little
tommy
jones
no
i
billy
bounce
then
you
sha
come
to
my
house
but
you
come
to
the
haunted
house
then
he
called
aloud
in
a
weird
voice
spooks
spirits
ghosts
wraiths
banshees
and
all
come
quick
here
is
billy
bounce
in
spookville
with
a
rattle
of
chains
screams
groans
and
a
thousand
odd
and
terrible
sounds
the
inhabitants
of
the
village
swooped
down
on
them
for
a
few
moments
billy
was
absolutely
frozen
stiff
with
fear
and
when
he
looked
around
him
at
the
horrible
shapes
and
faces
that
surrounded
him
he
was
worse
frightened
than
ever
some
of
them
breathed
fire
and
steam
while
their
eyes
glowed
like
coals
others
had
old
crafty
and
wicked
faces
with
huge
snaggle
teeth
some
looked
like
fierce
and
bloodthirsty
pirates
all
sorts
and
conditions
of
ghosts
were
there
and
all
seemingly
intent
on
tearing
billy
limb
from
limb
see
him
tremble
called
one
old
pirate
ah
this
reminds
me
of
old
times
on
the
spanish
main
make
him
walk
the
plank
scream
into
his
ear
until
he
is
deaf
cried
a
banshee
put
a
ball
and
chain
on
him
and
throw
him
in
a
cell
suggested
the
ghost
of
a
convict
he
the
boy
who
discovered
shamville
he
will
tell
on
all
of
us
if
we
let
him
live
said
a
old
merchant
make
him
eat
his
own
head
cried
a
headless
horseman
get
away
cried
billy
you
are
a
host
of
delusions
i
believe
in
ghosts
anyway
and
i
not
afraid
of
you
for
he
had
just
remembered
what
gas
said
about
being
afraid
he
took
a
step
forward
and
in
doing
so
walked
through
five
or
six
ghosts
who
were
crowding
him
closely
swish
and
every
mother
ghost
of
them
had
disappeared
and
he
was
standing
in
the
meadow
alone
the
moon
came
from
behind
its
cloud
and
distinctly
winked
at
billy
and
what
a
relief
it
was
to
be
sure
there
he
said
to
himself
gas
was
right
so
long
as
a
fellow
is
afraid
in
the
dark
he
will
see
all
kinds
of
things
ghosts
and
everything
else
but
if
he
just
grits
his
teeth
and
makes
up
his
mind
to
be
afraid
there
is
no
more
in
the
dark
to
hurt
you
than
in
the
sunlight
and
with
that
he
planted
the
singing
tree
curled
up
beneath
it
and
in
a
minute
was
sound
asleep
chapter
xvii
in
the
volcano
of
vociferous
when
billy
awoke
the
next
morning
and
saw
the
dear
old
sun
grinning
down
at
him
and
looked
about
at
the
green
meadow
dotted
with
susans
and
dandelions
he
could
hardly
realize
that
his
adventures
of
the
night
before
were
real
but
there
on
the
edge
of
the
open
space
stood
the
trees
that
had
creaked
so
dismally
while
even
then
among
its
trunks
lingered
some
of
the
mist
that
had
made
the
walls
of
spookville
what
did
you
think
of
it
dogibus
he
said
to
barker
but
that
merry
little
chap
looked
so
happy
and
contented
and
his
eyes
seemed
so
clear
of
unpleasant
memories
that
billy
decided
that
dogs
do
see
ghosts
perhaps
because
they
are
not
afraid
in
the
dark
and
anyway
have
any
nurses
to
tell
them
things
that
are
not
true
half
past
eight
time
we
were
off
said
billy
looking
at
his
waterbury
and
so
off
they
flew
into
space
i
doubt
if
i
can
float
over
that
high
mountain
he
said
presently
what
a
thing
it
is
too
and
no
wonder
it
was
queer
looking
for
it
was
the
volcano
of
vociferous
with
just
a
little
thin
white
vapor
rising
from
its
crater
oh
me
oh
my
i
falling
right
into
the
hole
he
cried
i
wonder
if
i
will
fetch
up
in
china
and
sure
enough
when
he
got
right
over
the
crater
he
began
to
fall
fall
fall
through
the
opening
and
way
down
towards
the
centre
of
the
earth
and
just
about
the
time
he
had
given
up
hopes
of
ever
landing
in
any
place
he
hit
plump
on
a
floor
of
lava
right
in
front
of
him
was
a
door
bearing
this
sign
the
coal
man
best
anthracite
and
soft
coal
new
gold
and
silver
bought
and
sold
a
specialty
for
admission
to
works
apply
at
office
walk
in
turning
the
handle
billy
walked
in
well
said
a
old
man
who
was
bustling
about
the
office
and
whom
billy
rightly
took
for
the
coal
man
how
do
you
do
said
billy
tired
very
tired
answered
the
coal
man
worked
to
death
i
have
a
rush
order
for
an
eruption
of
vociferous
and
it
keeping
my
alchemist
and
myself
busy
day
and
night
while
the
coal
stokers
and
furnace
tenders
threaten
to
strike
for
lower
wages
illustration
coal
that
too
bad
said
billy
sympathetically
not
a
bit
of
it
i
like
the
work
i
suppose
you
want
to
go
through
the
works
if
it
not
too
much
trouble
i
do
know
whether
you
will
find
it
too
much
trouble
or
not
you
will
have
to
decide
that
for
yourself
i
mean
for
you
it
ca
be
for
me
because
i
not
going
what
your
name
billy
bounce
billy
bounce
glad
to
know
you
billy
i
heard
a
great
deal
of
you
from
a
customer
of
min
a
customer
who
is
he
nickel
plate
the
polished
villain
he
comes
down
here
every
once
in
a
while
to
be
plated
nickel
plate
cried
billy
in
alarm
why
he
is
my
enemy
i
know
it
said
the
coal
man
but
do
mind
that
he
his
own
best
friend
but
if
that
the
case
are
you
going
to
harm
me
certainly
not
you
ca
do
me
any
harm
by
telling
the
truth
about
my
work
you
will
find
that
your
only
enemies
are
the
people
who
know
you
will
expose
them
as
imitations
i
had
thought
of
that
before
said
billy
greatly
relieved
of
course
you
had
they
would
either
if
they
had
felt
so
guilty
themselves
well
here
your
card
of
admission
and
do
pick
up
any
hot
lava
thank
you
said
billy
i
wo
the
coal
man
opened
the
door
leading
into
the
works
such
a
wonderful
sight
as
met
billy
gaze
a
deep
red
glow
was
over
everything
growing
lighter
and
duller
every
few
moments
as
the
stokers
would
open
a
furnace
door
shovel
in
some
coal
and
slam
the
door
to
again
and
the
stokers
they
were
indeed
sights
black
as
coal
and
as
shiny
as
boots
which
with
their
fiery
red
hair
made
them
look
like
on
fire
here
and
there
among
them
wandered
an
old
old
man
with
a
very
wise
face
and
long
white
hair
in
one
hand
he
carried
a
pair
of
scales
and
with
the
other
he
was
putting
into
them
first
some
of
this
and
then
some
of
that
which
he
weighed
carefully
and
deposited
in
what
looked
like
a
great
big
cartridge
shell
how
do
you
do
sir
said
billy
gun
cotton
and
vaseline
in
parts
of
two
to
oh
how
do
do
sir
said
billy
i
understood
the
last
part
of
your
sentence
but
i
do
think
i
heard
the
first
part
very
well
a
little
sulphur
now
i
wonder
if
i
better
put
any
in
it
this
time
what
do
you
think
boy
and
he
looked
at
billy
as
if
he
were
a
thousand
miles
off
i
do
know
sir
then
why
do
you
presume
to
offer
advice
so
you
do
think
a
safe
thing
to
put
in
it
neither
do
i
but
i
said
i
did
know
said
billy
true
you
did
i
had
forgotten
if
that
the
case
i
better
use
are
you
the
alchemist
let
see
am
i
i
really
forgotten
ace
of
spades
calling
to
the
blackest
stoker
of
them
all
come
here
yes
sir
said
ace
running
up
to
them
well
what
do
you
want
asked
the
old
man
looking
at
ace
in
surprise
you
called
me
sir
said
ace
did
i
what
for
do
you
know
no
sir
said
ace
excuse
me
said
billy
but
i
think
it
was
to
ask
him
if
you
were
the
alchemist
that
ca
have
been
it
because
i
the
alchemist
no
doubt
about
that
is
there
ace
no
sir
said
ace
then
do
interrupt
me
again
with
your
foolish
questions
ace
you
know
it
bothers
me
when
i
making
up
a
sample
eruption
ace
bowed
gravely
as
if
he
were
used
to
such
things
and
ran
back
to
his
work
illustration
that
the
trouble
with
these
men
said
the
alchemist
they
are
all
so
if
i
were
not
here
to
think
for
them
i
do
know
what
would
become
of
the
business
excuse
me
began
billy
certainly
interrupted
the
alchemist
putting
some
in
his
ears
i
was
going
to
say
did
you
say
you
were
making
a
sample
eruption
did
you
speak
to
me
i
seem
to
have
heard
you
speak
yes
sir
i
ca
hear
a
word
you
say
i
afraid
i
growing
deaf
now
what
did
i
do
with
that
i
had
a
moment
ago
and
the
alchemist
looked
for
it
in
every
place
but
in
his
ears
but
billy
by
making
motions
showed
him
where
it
was
and
he
pulled
it
out
in
great
surprise
you
should
do
that
said
he
severely
it
a
very
dangerous
thing
but
i
did
said
billy
you
did
it
yourself
why
should
i
put
in
my
own
ears
i
never
listen
to
evil
reports
billy
was
just
about
to
make
further
denial
when
the
coal
man
put
his
head
through
the
door
and
beckoned
to
him
nickel
plate
is
coming
down
in
the
elevator
said
he
as
soon
as
billy
reached
his
side
nickel
plate
down
here
exclaimed
billy
yes
he
is
coming
for
a
and
bumbus
and
drone
are
with
him
they
must
see
me
that
the
reason
i
called
you
i
suppose
you
do
mind
hiding
not
at
all
then
come
along
and
he
led
billy
into
the
works
and
to
a
dark
heavily
barred
vault
marked
gold
throwing
open
the
door
he
invited
billy
to
enter
this
is
where
we
keep
the
gold
supply
of
the
earth
he
said
pick
out
a
soft
nugget
to
sit
on
and
make
yourself
at
home
you
had
better
lock
yourself
in
thank
you
said
billy
locking
the
door
and
pocketing
the
key
and
as
it
was
dark
as
pitch
in
the
vault
and
light
in
the
works
no
one
on
the
outside
could
well
see
through
the
bars
of
the
door
this
is
fine
but
i
do
think
i
shall
sit
down
i
want
to
see
what
they
do
he
had
finished
saying
this
when
in
walked
nickel
plate
bumbus
and
drone
followed
by
the
coal
man
yes
nickel
plate
was
saying
as
they
entered
i
getting
terribly
rusty
and
i
need
a
new
plating
in
other
words
he
wants
you
to
make
a
shining
example
of
him
said
bumbus
excuse
me
said
drone
you
have
a
cot
here
have
you
i
lost
so
much
sleep
lately
i
lost
sleep
exclaimed
nickel
plate
in
disgust
yes
i
have
not
had
more
than
twenty
hours
sleep
in
the
last
they
kept
me
busy
looking
for
billy
bounce
at
mention
of
his
name
billy
drew
back
into
the
shadow
and
honey
girl
too
said
bumbus
i
ca
guess
what
has
become
of
her
ay
we
are
foiled
at
every
turn
but
wait
wait
our
day
is
coming
let
me
but
get
rid
of
these
rust
spots
and
restore
my
polish
and
they
can
not
escape
us
now
when
billy
heard
about
honey
girl
and
her
safety
it
made
him
very
happy
but
the
thought
that
nickel
plate
was
going
to
get
back
his
polish
worried
him
considerably
i
do
hope
something
will
happen
to
prevent
the
plating
he
said
to
himself
bumbus
by
this
time
was
running
about
in
his
usual
inquisitive
way
peering
into
everything
and
handling
all
the
tools
and
chemicals
suddenly
boom
sizzle
bang
went
the
alchemist
unfinished
cartridge
on
which
bumbus
at
that
moment
was
standing
to
reach
a
shelf
and
up
up
up
went
bumbus
through
the
shaft
that
supplied
the
furnaces
luckily
for
everybody
there
were
very
few
things
in
the
cartridge
not
enough
to
make
even
a
sample
eruption
even
bumbus
was
hurt
only
very
very
much
surprised
and
blown
too
many
miles
away
from
vociferous
to
get
back
that
day
how
very
careless
said
the
alchemist
pettishly
now
i
got
to
do
the
work
all
over
again
if
i
known
he
wanted
to
be
blown
up
i
could
have
arranged
it
very
easily
and
at
half
the
trouble
and
expense
why
did
bumbus
leave
so
suddenly
asked
drone
waking
up
let
bumbus
look
out
for
himself
said
nickel
plate
ignoring
the
question
what
i
want
now
is
my
plating
ace
of
spades
called
the
coal
man
bring
out
the
furnace
ace
of
spades
and
his
helper
rolled
a
great
portable
furnace
glowing
red
with
heat
into
the
middle
of
the
floor
step
in
please
said
the
coal
man
and
nickel
plate
opened
the
door
and
walked
in
please
hurry
up
with
that
two
dollars
in
nickels
alchemist
said
the
coal
man
i
do
seem
to
find
any
nickels
called
back
the
alchemist
i
suppose
a
bill
wo
do
you
know
it
wo
said
nickel
plate
you
got
up
the
formula
yourself
and
please
hurry
it
getting
warm
in
here
that
true
said
the
alchemist
hurrying
up
with
a
handful
of
nickels
ace
of
spades
had
forgotten
what
we
wanted
them
for
i
did
say
anything
about
it
said
ace
sulkily
that
just
the
trouble
with
you
people
said
the
alchemist
pouring
the
nickels
into
the
top
of
the
furnace
if
you
had
spoken
about
it
i
should
have
known
you
were
wrong
and
saved
all
this
time
quickly
the
nickels
melted
and
down
poured
the
plating
onto
nickel
plate
and
in
a
jiffy
out
he
stepped
as
bright
and
shiny
as
a
new
coin
he
cried
patting
himself
on
the
chest
i
feel
brighter
already
i
find
billy
bounce
and
honey
girl
without
a
bit
of
trouble
and
much
to
billy
dismay
he
walked
straight
over
to
the
vault
in
which
he
was
hid
but
instead
of
looking
in
as
billy
expected
he
leaned
against
the
grating
and
putting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
looked
about
him
complacently
the
coal
man
too
was
worried
by
this
move
and
did
all
he
could
to
distract
his
attention
and
call
him
away
from
the
door
come
here
quick
cried
he
ca
do
it
i
nickel
plate
not
besides
i
want
to
cool
off
how
can
i
rust
his
new
suit
said
billy
to
himself
if
i
can
do
that
without
his
knowing
it
he
will
be
as
badly
off
as
ever
and
looking
down
at
the
floor
to
think
he
saw
a
large
piece
of
sulphur
that
had
been
blown
in
when
the
explosion
occurred
sulphur
tarnishes
the
silverware
at
home
he
thought
i
wonder
if
it
would
affect
nickel
plating
he
softly
picked
it
up
and
made
a
mark
on
nickel
plate
back
sure
enough
it
made
a
long
black
streak
good
he
exclaimed
under
his
breath
if
i
put
a
lot
of
black
marks
on
his
back
it
will
not
only
destroy
his
power
but
everyone
who
sees
them
will
know
that
he
is
a
villain
i
know
that
black
marks
were
what
teachers
used
to
give
us
to
show
that
our
deportment
was
good
and
in
a
jiffy
billy
had
covered
nickel
plate
back
with
black
marks
poor
nickel
plate
had
no
idea
what
was
going
on
behind
his
back
indeed
he
was
so
surprised
at
the
coal
man
antics
that
he
could
think
of
anything
else
for
of
course
the
coal
man
saw
what
billy
was
doing
and
was
laughing
and
slapping
his
knees
and
jumping
up
and
down
with
delight
well
come
on
drone
said
nickel
plate
starting
away
we
must
be
going
drone
drone
wake
up
i
say
and
drone
got
up
from
a
bed
of
lava
rubbing
his
eyes
and
yawning
but
he
was
so
sleepy
he
paid
no
attention
to
nickel
plate
back
and
out
they
both
walked
without
ever
discovering
the
trick
billy
had
played
as
soon
as
they
had
gone
billy
came
out
of
his
thank
you
coal
man
mr
alchemist
and
ace
of
spades
i
ever
forget
your
kindness
to
me
run
along
and
do
interrupt
said
the
alchemist
hard
at
work
with
his
scales
you
welcome
ace
of
spades
bobbed
his
red
head
and
smiled
to
show
that
billy
was
welcome
to
all
he
had
done
come
along
said
the
coal
man
i
show
you
the
way
out
and
he
led
billy
to
the
floor
beneath
the
crater
where
he
warmly
shook
hands
with
him
take
good
care
of
yourself
boy
you
made
me
laugh
more
than
i
have
for
years
cried
billy
giving
a
great
big
jump
and
up
he
popped
out
of
the
mouth
of
vociferous
and
away
over
the
green
fields
and
forests
chapter
xviii
the
elusive
bridge
i
must
be
very
near
the
end
of
my
journey
said
billy
the
morning
after
he
ruined
nickel
plate
new
coat
i
have
been
on
the
air
road
a
long
time
and
certainly
i
have
had
some
queer
adventures
what
shall
i
say
to
bogie
man
when
i
see
him
i
wonder
but
here
he
lit
on
the
ground
and
looked
around
him
about
half
a
block
behind
him
he
saw
a
most
peculiar
looking
bridge
a
bridge
that
seemed
to
be
floating
in
the
air
and
yet
came
very
near
to
touching
the
ground
at
each
end
but
what
interested
him
was
the
dark
and
dismal
looking
city
on
the
other
side
of
the
bridge
why
that
strange
the
bridge
and
the
city
are
behind
me
so
i
must
have
passed
over
them
yet
i
do
remember
seeing
them
at
all
billy
had
been
looking
at
them
over
his
shoulder
and
now
turned
to
get
a
better
view
but
when
he
turned
he
saw
nothing
before
him
but
a
great
wide
stretch
of
land
the
bridge
and
the
city
had
disappeared
i
am
sure
i
saw
a
bridge
and
city
over
there
and
he
casually
turned
his
head
to
look
around
him
again
there
at
his
back
were
the
objects
he
sought
i
must
have
turned
all
the
way
round
without
noticing
it
but
this
time
i
going
to
keep
an
eye
on
them
when
i
turn
so
billy
turned
very
very
slowly
keeping
a
close
watch
on
the
bridge
and
city
but
as
he
turned
they
turned
it
made
no
difference
how
fast
or
how
slow
the
motion
barker
old
dog
he
said
finally
in
despair
i
afraid
my
head
is
turned
i
want
you
to
try
it
so
he
took
barker
out
of
his
pocket
and
placed
him
on
the
ground
then
he
turned
his
own
and
barker
heads
over
their
shoulders
and
pointing
to
the
city
said
watch
it
good
dog
watch
it
barker
undoubtedly
understood
and
as
his
neck
was
comfortable
with
his
head
turned
he
turned
his
body
around
he
stopped
and
looked
around
him
in
the
greatest
dog
surprise
caught
sight
of
the
city
over
his
shoulder
and
turned
again
then
he
began
to
get
excited
and
before
billy
could
stop
him
was
spinning
round
and
round
like
a
kitten
after
its
tail
and
he
spun
and
spun
and
he
spun
billy
all
the
time
trying
to
make
head
or
tail
of
him
until
he
got
so
dizzy
that
he
fell
over
on
his
side
good
old
dog
cried
billy
picking
him
up
and
putting
him
in
his
pocket
you
have
proved
that
i
not
the
only
one
who
ca
get
the
bridge
in
front
of
him
but
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
get
to
that
city
if
it
takes
the
rest
of
my
life
for
it
looks
to
me
like
never
was
where
bogie
man
lives
and
with
that
he
commenced
to
walk
backwards
and
he
walked
and
walked
and
walked
but
not
an
inch
nearer
to
the
bridge
did
he
get
i
wonder
if
i
could
jump
backwards
i
try
it
and
back
he
jumped
up
he
went
and
back
he
flew
it
was
a
very
comfortable
feeling
either
not
to
know
just
where
he
was
going
and
he
certainly
hoped
he
would
bump
into
any
buildings
when
he
did
reach
the
city
but
he
closed
his
eyes
and
waited
until
at
last
his
feet
touched
earth
then
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
him
expecting
to
find
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
city
not
a
bit
of
it
there
he
was
in
the
same
spot
he
had
started
from
with
the
bridge
and
the
city
just
over
his
shoulder
well
i
be
gum
swizzled
he
exclaimed
in
surprise
i
should
said
an
important
looking
man
in
a
black
uniform
and
a
little
round
cap
bearing
the
words
toll
gate
keeper
you
might
be
gummed
you
know
like
an
envelope
but
it
would
do
to
be
swizzled
what
is
swizzled
asked
billy
how
should
i
know
but
you
should
for
you
said
you
would
be
it
was
just
an
expression
with
me
oh
you
meant
to
say
you
would
be
expressed
what
are
the
express
rates
on
boys
no
i
did
mean
that
what
i
meant
to
say
is
that
what
i
meant
to
say
was
oh
pshaw
i
do
know
what
i
talking
about
illustration
toll
gate
of
course
you
do
and
as
i
do
either
let
change
the
subject
and
the
toll
gate
keeper
nodded
his
head
very
gravely
then
can
you
tell
me
what
city
that
is
back
there
asked
billy
pointing
over
his
shoulder
yes
said
the
toll
man
and
then
he
began
to
hum
a
tune
as
though
that
closed
the
discussion
well
said
billy
quite
well
thank
you
how
do
you
feel
but
i
did
mean
that
i
was
waiting
for
an
answer
to
my
question
i
answered
all
the
questions
you
asked
of
course
if
you
have
asked
it
yet
you
ca
expect
me
to
answer
it
but
i
asked
you
if
you
could
tell
me
what
city
that
is
back
there
and
i
said
i
could
i
sure
that
answering
your
question
and
the
toll
man
looked
grieved
then
why
do
you
tell
me
because
you
have
asked
me
to
why
should
i
waste
my
valuable
time
answering
questions
that
were
never
asked
then
what
city
is
it
asked
billy
angrily
never
was
thank
you
and
now
i
will
ask
you
do
i
have
to
cross
that
bridge
to
get
there
you
already
crossed
it
said
the
toll
gate
keeper
and
i
here
to
collect
your
toll
i
beg
your
pardon
i
have
crossed
it
said
billy
oh
but
you
have
otherwise
you
would
be
here
but
how
could
i
have
crossed
it
i
have
gotten
to
it
yet
of
course
not
if
you
had
gotten
to
it
you
would
have
crossed
it
and
the
toll
man
looked
at
billy
as
much
as
to
say
well
you
a
dull
boy
if
you
ca
understand
that
that
ridiculous
said
billy
what
sort
of
a
bridge
is
it
anyway
the
bridge
that
people
cross
before
they
come
to
it
but
there
is
no
such
bridge
of
course
there
not
that
the
reason
people
cross
it
before
they
get
to
it
then
how
am
i
to
get
to
the
city
i
do
know
and
i
do
care
i
did
send
you
there
all
i
know
is
that
the
only
way
to
never
was
is
over
the
bridge
that
people
cross
before
they
get
to
it
then
all
i
can
see
is
that
i
shall
have
to
cross
the
bridge
said
billy
i
told
you
that
you
already
crossed
it
stop
a
minute
cried
billy
putting
his
fingers
in
his
ears
my
head
is
in
a
whirl
how
can
i
stop
a
minute
i
have
to
catch
it
first
and
do
you
know
that
time
flies
i
mean
wait
for
a
minute
which
minute
do
you
want
me
to
wait
for
oh
stop
it
stop
it
do
stop
anything
i
mean
do
wait
for
anything
if
you
say
another
word
i
go
crazy
and
poor
bewildered
billy
sat
down
on
the
ground
and
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
there
i
feel
better
said
he
finally
raising
his
head
who
are
you
please
i
the
toll
gate
keeper
also
the
man
that
people
borrow
trouble
from
oh
said
billy
no
i
do
owe
i
lend
and
it
a
poor
business
for
no
one
ever
pays
me
back
more
people
owe
me
a
grudge
than
a
thousand
legger
can
count
on
its
fingers
and
toes
are
you
afraid
to
have
so
many
people
owing
you
a
grudge
asked
billy
how
can
i
help
it
they
borrow
trouble
from
me
without
asking
for
it
and
anyway
it
worries
them
more
than
it
does
me
this
is
certainly
a
place
said
billy
what
is
that
sign
on
the
bridge
is
it
in
greek
oh
no
that
just
because
you
see
the
back
of
it
it
only
for
people
who
are
crossing
and
says
your
horses
do
horses
ever
cross
the
bridge
none
have
so
far
it
just
put
there
in
case
they
should
you
know
if
wishes
were
horses
beggars
would
ride
and
of
course
if
you
put
a
beggar
on
horseback
he
will
ride
you
down
that
would
make
it
very
unpleasant
for
any
one
who
was
walking
if
there
should
ever
happen
to
be
any
do
many
people
cross
the
bridge
asked
billy
i
do
know
i
sure
as
they
all
cross
it
before
they
get
to
it
by
the
time
they
get
there
they
have
already
crossed
it
so
impossible
to
make
them
pass
through
the
turnstiles
i
wish
i
knew
how
to
get
to
never
was
said
billy
sadly
i
ca
help
you
because
what
has
once
been
done
ca
be
undone
unless
time
turns
back
and
as
what
you
have
done
was
done
before
you
did
it
i
do
see
how
you
can
ever
do
it
no
i
very
sure
you
ca
help
me
said
billy
but
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
i
must
get
to
bogie
man
house
you
will
do
well
if
you
do
for
no
one
has
ever
seen
bogie
man
said
the
toll
gate
keeper
no
one
has
ever
seen
him
no
lots
of
people
have
thought
they
saw
him
but
he
keeps
himself
just
out
of
sight
i
wonder
what
time
it
is
said
billy
pulling
out
his
waterbury
i
do
hate
to
waste
so
much
time
why
it
ca
be
eleven
yet
just
half
past
ten
said
the
toll
man
pulling
out
his
sun
dial
i
wonder
what
happened
to
my
watch
i
must
turn
it
back
and
pressing
the
spring
billy
turned
the
hands
back
to
ten
thirty
just
at
that
moment
he
happened
to
catch
sight
of
the
bridge
over
his
shoulder
and
strange
to
say
it
was
almost
in
touching
distance
hurrah
he
cried
delightedly
here
the
bridge
right
here
now
i
sure
to
catch
it
and
he
ran
backwards
as
hard
as
he
could
but
without
getting
an
inch
nearer
to
it
how
did
it
get
here
anyway
he
asked
i
do
know
said
the
bridge
keeper
i
noticed
it
coming
up
while
you
were
setting
your
watch
back
that
it
that
it
cried
billy
do
you
know
you
said
that
what
has
once
been
done
ca
be
undone
unless
time
turns
back
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
ca
you
see
when
i
turned
time
back
up
came
the
bridge
now
i
am
going
to
turn
it
back
more
and
get
to
the
other
side
do
risk
it
do
risk
it
cried
the
toll
gate
keeper
in
great
excitement
if
you
should
happen
to
be
lost
between
two
hours
you
might
never
catch
up
with
time
again
but
billy
did
not
heed
the
warning
for
he
knew
he
could
turn
his
watch
ahead
again
and
make
up
for
any
lost
time
that
way
so
back
went
the
hands
of
the
watch
and
spang
billy
stood
in
the
dark
and
dismal
streets
of
never
was
far
far
off
in
front
of
him
this
time
was
the
bridge
and
on
the
other
side
waving
his
arms
in
despair
stood
the
toll
gate
keeper
chapter
xix
in
the
dark
never
was
at
last
cried
billy
when
he
found
himself
in
never
was
but
never
again
cross
a
bridge
before
i
come
to
it
it
makes
too
much
unnecessary
trouble
and
off
he
started
down
the
street
to
find
bogie
man
house
there
did
not
seem
to
be
a
soul
on
the
streets
nearly
every
house
that
billy
passed
was
shut
up
tight
and
had
a
board
tacked
on
the
front
door
reading
gone
away
for
life
back
next
eternity
each
one
was
signed
by
the
owner
and
such
a
lot
of
names
as
he
read
one
was
hobgoblin
another
gnome
another
bloody
bones
another
was
wicked
giant
another
cruel
stepmother
another
boog
a
boo
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
fact
almost
every
one
of
the
things
or
people
that
frighten
little
boys
and
girls
and
even
some
that
used
to
frighten
had
left
this
earth
for
parts
unknown
it
looks
to
me
said
billy
as
though
bogie
man
was
about
the
only
one
of
the
whole
lot
who
is
left
and
he
seems
to
be
pretty
hard
to
find
finders
losers
keepers
weepers
said
a
voice
and
billy
was
surprised
to
see
a
little
man
standing
in
front
of
him
why
said
billy
where
did
you
come
from
you
are
the
first
person
i
seen
here
and
i
began
to
think
i
was
the
only
one
in
town
do
ever
get
that
idea
said
the
little
man
what
idea
that
you
are
the
only
one
any
place
there
are
always
a
few
more
better
than
you
are
wherever
you
are
i
suppose
so
said
billy
i
do
suppose
it
i
know
it
because
seeing
is
not
believing
what
is
the
meaning
of
that
that
a
secret
some
day
perhaps
i
not
tell
you
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
said
billy
and
i
heard
a
great
deal
the
last
few
days
many
a
fib
is
told
in
jest
you
know
but
it
not
my
fault
if
i
do
talk
nonsense
that
is
the
misfortune
of
having
a
wooden
leg
and
the
little
man
made
a
dab
at
billy
toes
with
his
stump
what
has
a
wooden
leg
got
to
do
with
it
nothing
at
all
i
merely
mentioned
that
it
is
a
misfortune
to
have
a
wooden
leg
i
should
think
it
would
be
hard
to
bear
said
billy
sympathetically
no
because
it
already
bare
but
i
should
complain
i
make
my
living
on
it
your
living
how
can
that
be
i
guess
you
do
know
who
i
am
and
the
little
man
struck
an
attitude
no
i
do
i
am
mumbledy
peg
bogie
man
official
potato
masher
ugh
said
billy
in
disgust
how
dirty
dirty
why
to
mash
potatoes
with
your
wooden
leg
but
i
do
i
use
a
potato
masher
like
anybody
else
then
i
do
see
why
you
said
you
made
your
living
with
your
wooden
leg
i
did
i
said
i
made
my
living
on
it
and
i
do
because
i
always
stand
up
to
mash
potatoes
and
mumbledy
peg
spun
around
on
his
wooden
leg
in
great
delight
you
making
fun
of
me
said
billy
no
you
were
already
funny
i
did
make
you
so
illustration
if
you
ca
talk
seriously
and
without
insulting
me
began
billy
tut
tut
interrupted
mumbledy
peg
if
i
have
insulted
you
you
are
very
sorry
and
i
sincerely
accept
your
humble
apology
but
i
did
apologize
i
had
nothing
to
apologize
for
then
that
shows
how
generous
i
am
i
accept
it
anyway
and
mumbledy
peg
held
out
his
hand
come
we
will
shake
hands
and
be
good
enemies
again
and
he
looked
so
merry
and
about
it
that
billy
could
resist
a
smile
did
you
say
that
you
were
bogie
man
official
potato
masher
asked
billy
i
not
only
said
so
but
i
am
then
you
know
where
he
lives
yes
but
i
never
been
there
you
never
been
there
exclaimed
billy
no
of
course
not
why
should
i
go
there
to
mash
potatoes
of
course
ah
but
i
said
i
was
the
potato
masher
officials
never
go
near
the
office
we
let
the
servants
do
that
said
mumbledy
peg
and
you
get
a
high
salary
for
doing
nothing
yes
of
course
the
higher
the
salary
the
less
the
work
is
our
motto
or
to
be
exact
the
fewer
the
higher
perhaps
you
can
direct
me
to
bogie
man
house
who
knows
said
mumbledy
peg
i
willing
to
try
it
if
you
are
i
am
said
billy
i
am
very
anxious
to
deliver
a
note
to
him
i
take
it
for
a
dime
i
love
to
read
notes
but
you
ca
read
this
if
it
typewritten
i
can
and
anyway
if
i
miss
any
words
you
can
tell
them
to
me
but
i
do
want
you
to
read
it
it
not
for
you
said
billy
i
not
particular
about
that
i
could
probably
find
something
in
it
that
would
amuse
me
and
mumbledy
peg
held
out
his
hand
for
the
note
just
as
if
everything
had
been
settled
no
i
rather
take
it
myself
said
billy
oh
all
right
if
you
going
to
be
selfish
with
your
old
note
go
ahead
but
i
warn
you
that
you
have
lost
your
chance
forever
to
have
the
note
read
for
if
you
should
come
to
me
now
and
beg
me
on
bended
knee
to
read
that
note
i
should
refuse
that
the
kind
of
a
man
i
am
do
worry
said
billy
i
sha
ask
you
that
wo
help
you
any
for
i
wo
read
it
even
if
you
do
ask
me
and
in
high
dudgeon
mumbledy
peg
started
to
stump
off
down
the
street
hold
on
called
billy
running
after
him
i
have
nothing
to
hold
on
to
but
do
worry
i
wo
fall
ca
you
give
a
sensible
answer
to
anything
no
i
used
to
do
that
and
people
said
i
had
so
much
common
sense
i
could
be
very
bright
when
i
began
talking
nonsense
they
said
it
was
so
foolish
it
must
be
very
clever
and
thus
i
gained
a
great
reputation
for
being
witty
well
just
for
once
wo
you
try
to
talk
common
sense
said
billy
how
can
i
get
to
bogie
man
house
there
is
just
one
way
and
that
is
to
walk
we
have
no
street
cars
here
i
mean
in
what
direction
shall
i
go
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
which
way
you
go
see
here
billy
bounce
i
know
you
said
mumbledy
peg
severely
you
know
me
asked
billy
in
surprise
yes
i
do
and
i
not
going
to
help
you
find
bogie
man
house
oh
you
not
said
billy
well
suppose
i
find
it
anyway
you
ca
no
one
ever
finds
bogie
man
unless
he
does
want
to
find
him
we
will
see
about
that
said
billy
angrily
and
when
i
do
find
him
and
deliver
the
note
i
going
to
tell
him
just
what
i
think
of
him
he
does
care
what
you
think
of
him
thoughts
never
hurt
any
one
but
their
thinkers
that
is
too
deep
for
me
said
billy
there
it
is
said
mumbledy
peg
in
disgust
when
i
say
something
sensible
you
do
understand
me
then
you
wo
help
me
to
find
bogie
man
not
an
inch
and
i
will
say
further
that
if
all
our
leading
citizens
had
not
left
for
mars
in
search
of
work
you
would
be
alive
in
this
town
for
three
minutes
i
not
trying
to
harm
you
said
billy
we
wo
discuss
the
matter
further
good
night
and
mumbledy
peg
drove
himself
right
into
the
ground
and
disappeared
leaving
billy
alone
in
the
dark
street
i
ca
get
him
back
unless
i
pull
him
out
with
my
teeth
i
suppose
said
billy
and
i
not
going
to
try
that
now
what
am
i
to
do
without
a
guide
it
is
fearfully
dark
and
lonely
and
i
seem
to
be
as
far
from
seeing
bogie
man
as
ever
i
wonder
what
street
this
is
he
tried
to
see
the
sign
on
the
lamp
post
of
course
the
lamp
was
not
lit
for
they
never
are
in
never
was
until
daylight
but
he
could
possibly
make
it
out
so
he
fumbled
about
in
his
pockets
until
he
found
a
match
he
lighted
this
and
by
its
feeble
flame
read
the
sign
the
the
he
repeated
to
himself
that
a
strange
name
for
a
street
i
wonder
if
bogie
man
lives
anywhere
near
why
of
course
he
must
live
in
this
street
because
he
is
nearly
always
seen
on
the
road
to
bed
now
billy
did
not
exactly
mean
that
bogie
man
seen
because
although
many
little
boys
and
little
girls
have
they
saw
bogie
man
have
thought
they
heard
him
creeping
up
behind
them
to
seize
their
shoulders
or
was
hid
under
the
bed
to
catch
ankles
when
they
hopped
into
bed
he
was
really
there
at
all
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
he
had
never
in
his
life
left
never
was
until
billy
took
but
there
you
will
learn
later
what
billy
did
to
him
chapter
xx
the
window
of
fear
i
wish
i
had
a
candle
said
billy
trying
to
look
around
him
for
it
was
so
very
dark
he
really
could
not
see
anything
but
black
shadows
and
the
black
shadows
of
the
shadows
indeed
it
had
suddenly
grown
darker
than
ever
before
and
the
wind
began
to
moan
as
it
sometimes
does
when
a
storm
is
brewing
of
course
i
not
afraid
of
bogie
man
but
i
think
i
rather
have
a
candle
with
me
just
just
for
companionship
i
wonder
if
the
singing
tree
could
help
me
so
he
sat
him
down
in
the
middle
of
the
street
planted
barker
bark
and
told
the
tree
what
he
wanted
at
once
it
sang
little
nancy
etticoat
in
a
white
petticoat
and
a
red
nose
the
longer
she
stands
the
shorter
she
grows
and
with
a
low
bow
handed
him
a
lighted
candle
that
better
he
said
i
seem
to
feel
easier
already
and
off
he
trudged
peering
up
at
the
houses
in
search
of
bogie
man
castle
of
course
he
could
walk
very
rapidly
for
the
candle
wavered
and
flickered
and
tried
more
than
once
to
go
out
but
he
shaded
it
with
his
cap
and
got
along
very
well
considering
and
at
last
he
stood
before
a
great
black
shadowy
building
dotted
with
large
windows
in
all
conceivable
shapes
some
looked
like
cruel
sneering
mouths
others
like
the
hungry
open
jaws
of
ogres
others
like
large
staring
eyes
in
fact
each
window
bore
a
hideous
aspect
and
all
were
as
dark
as
a
hole
in
the
ground
all
but
one
from
which
a
blue
and
yellow
light
streamed
and
this
was
the
most
hideous
window
of
all
for
it
did
not
look
like
anything
just
a
shapeless
nameless
dreadful
yellow
splotch
on
the
wall
and
over
it
billy
read
these
words
the
window
of
fear
look
not
lest
ye
see
terror
this
must
be
bogie
man
house
said
billy
i
i
am
sure
it
is
rude
to
look
in
at
windows
and
besides
that
ugh
a
hideous
window
i
try
the
front
door
at
last
he
found
a
wide
low
grinning
door
and
he
had
just
mustered
up
the
courage
to
ring
the
bell
whose
handle
was
the
tail
of
a
snake
when
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
out
flew
a
thin
gaunt
pink
flannel
cat
with
eyes
and
a
long
blue
worsted
tail
billy
tried
to
seize
this
opportunity
and
enter
but
slam
went
the
door
in
his
face
and
off
down
the
road
went
the
cat
and
at
the
same
moment
two
large
flat
things
with
waving
arms
lifted
themselves
up
in
front
of
him
and
tried
to
knock
his
candle
out
of
his
hand
billy
stepped
back
just
in
time
to
save
it
and
stood
staring
at
the
quivering
forms
what
are
those
things
i
wonder
he
exclaimed
layovers
to
catch
meddlers
said
one
of
them
hands
off
said
the
other
and
then
they
lay
down
again
on
the
then
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
if
this
is
bogie
man
house
he
said
it
is
now
go
away
said
one
this
door
is
only
to
go
out
by
it
never
opens
to
let
any
one
in
said
the
other
billy
thought
a
minute
and
then
hoping
he
could
surprise
them
into
telling
him
some
way
of
getting
in
said
then
how
is
that
cat
ever
to
get
in
again
it
never
will
said
the
first
layover
that
is
scaredy
cat
and
she
will
never
come
back
what
was
she
running
away
from
asked
billy
her
tail
her
tail
yes
it
is
a
frightful
yarn
now
go
away
i
through
talking
billy
tried
to
secure
an
answer
to
several
more
questions
but
never
a
word
could
he
get
out
of
them
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
look
through
the
window
of
fear
after
all
he
said
with
just
the
faintest
shiver
and
throwing
back
his
shoulders
he
made
for
the
window
he
had
to
hoist
himself
up
onto
the
sill
to
look
in
and
when
he
had
gotten
up
he
sat
with
his
back
to
the
window
and
his
eyes
closed
until
he
could
catch
his
breath
and
muster
up
his
courage
to
peep
in
then
he
slowly
turned
his
head
it
is
a
good
thing
he
had
a
tight
hold
on
the
broad
sill
for
the
sight
that
met
his
gaze
froze
his
blood
and
almost
knocked
him
off
his
balance
there
stood
bogie
man
in
the
middle
of
the
room
juggling
his
own
hideous
head
with
one
hand
and
a
great
ball
of
burning
sulphur
with
the
other
billy
saw
now
what
made
the
blue
and
yellow
light
it
was
the
sulphur
which
flashed
and
sizzled
as
it
went
through
the
air
emitting
a
million
angry
sparks
and
tongues
of
fire
when
it
struck
bogie
hand
and
bogie
man
body
ugh
as
tall
as
a
as
large
around
as
a
house
as
full
of
knots
as
an
old
yet
as
black
and
eerie
and
unformlike
as
a
flying
shadow
the
hair
on
the
head
was
long
and
green
his
eyes
like
two
sparks
floating
in
a
saucer
of
water
and
his
mouth
like
a
shark
he
had
a
nose
like
a
large
ripe
apple
and
i
must
vanquish
him
said
billy
in
dismay
i
will
for
honey
girl
sake
i
as
he
said
this
the
whole
world
seemed
to
take
fire
with
a
lurid
flash
of
lightning
crash
a
peal
of
thunder
split
the
heavens
and
rolled
and
rumbled
through
the
lonely
streets
of
never
was
then
the
rain
came
down
in
solid
sheets
the
wind
blew
a
hurricane
and
on
the
crest
of
the
gale
rode
a
thousand
shadowy
figures
shrieking
and
moaning
and
tumbling
over
and
over
as
they
came
the
first
touch
of
the
wind
blew
out
the
candle
and
at
the
same
moment
the
sulphur
ball
indoors
burst
and
disappeared
so
billy
sat
there
in
the
dark
his
back
to
the
window
and
in
front
of
him
countless
thousands
of
bitter
enemies
banshees
wraiths
ghosts
sprites
imps
riding
on
crimson
devil
horses
all
the
weird
and
wicked
things
that
claim
bogie
man
as
their
king
billy
bounce
called
the
voice
of
nickel
plate
illustration
shot
a
blast
of
hot
air
from
his
pump
full
in
bumbus
page
here
cried
billy
undismayed
hurrah
hurrah
hurrah
howl
howl
shriek
cried
the
enemy
caught
at
last
no
hope
no
hope
for
billy
bounce
said
a
voice
is
that
bumbus
asked
billy
i
be
said
bumbus
suddenly
jumping
onto
the
sill
and
trying
to
push
billy
off
but
swish
billy
shot
a
blast
of
hot
air
from
his
pump
full
in
bumbus
face
and
down
he
dropped
come
on
cried
billy
you
frighten
me
your
last
chance
cried
nickel
plate
give
up
and
i
will
save
you
never
cried
billy
and
with
that
the
battle
commenced
oh
the
countless
slaps
and
cuffs
and
tweaks
he
got
my
the
hideous
din
and
noise
of
their
cries
ugh
the
horrible
faces
they
pushed
right
into
his
but
the
harder
they
fought
and
tried
the
less
real
harm
they
seemed
to
be
able
to
do
fear
fear
was
their
only
weapon
and
as
billy
heart
grew
stout
within
him
the
weaker
became
their
attack
billy
leaned
heavily
against
the
window
and
worked
the
pump
desperately
time
and
time
again
the
imps
sprites
and
crimson
horses
renewed
the
attack
on
on
cried
nickel
plate
from
a
safe
place
in
the
rear
pluck
his
eyes
out
cried
bumbus
striking
at
billy
with
his
sword
put
him
to
sleep
forever
cried
drone
waking
up
in
the
midst
of
the
combat
but
billy
never
said
a
word
he
was
holding
his
breath
for
the
final
onslaught
which
he
felt
was
now
being
arranged
so
he
only
gritted
his
teeth
and
pumped
hot
air
into
and
through
the
frantic
enemy
down
went
bumbus
again
from
a
blast
in
the
ear
puff
puff
and
away
and
away
sailed
an
imp
never
to
return
again
rally
cried
nickel
plate
for
a
moment
there
was
a
lull
and
billy
knew
the
time
had
come
when
he
must
beat
or
be
beaten
i
not
afraid
he
panted
to
himself
and
then
with
a
rush
and
a
wild
shriek
the
enemy
hurled
itself
forward
in
a
solid
mass
on
they
came
yelling
terribly
their
eyes
spitting
flashes
of
light
and
their
mouths
and
jaws
working
in
horrible
grimaces
the
foremost
imp
had
just
come
in
striking
distance
when
billy
leaned
back
more
heavily
on
the
window
to
brace
himself
and
the
pane
broke
and
billy
was
inside
with
the
crash
all
sound
ceased
all
were
as
surprised
as
billy
quick
as
a
flash
he
was
up
on
his
feet
and
prepared
to
grapple
with
the
hideous
bogie
man
that
he
knew
was
in
the
room
with
him
light
he
cried
and
in
a
jiffy
he
had
pulled
his
candle
out
of
his
pocket
and
lighted
it
he
looked
for
bogie
man
he
was
gone
and
in
his
place
stood
a
little
old
shrivelled
man
where
is
bogie
man
cried
billy
and
then
stopped
and
looked
again
for
the
little
man
was
an
exact
miniature
of
the
big
figure
he
had
seen
through
the
window
of
fear
you
are
here
he
cried
i
see
it
now
the
window
was
a
magnifying
glass
at
last
at
last
the
little
man
made
a
move
for
the
door
no
you
do
you
got
to
take
the
note
cried
billy
forcing
it
into
bogie
man
unwilling
and
trembling
hands
and
now
he
began
but
just
as
he
spoke
in
through
the
broken
window
poured
the
enemy
intent
on
billy
capture
but
he
was
determined
to
have
his
talk
with
bogie
man
and
secure
his
promise
that
honey
girl
was
to
be
left
unharmed
seizing
bogie
man
he
cast
his
eyes
about
him
for
some
means
of
escape
he
saw
a
door
just
behind
him
with
one
bound
he
reached
it
threw
it
open
and
was
off
down
the
corridor
headed
for
the
front
door
which
he
saw
dimly
outlined
at
the
farthest
end
behind
him
shrieked
the
imps
and
sprites
filling
the
house
with
their
wild
weird
cries
the
foremost
imp
was
clutching
at
his
hair
and
had
almost
caught
him
when
he
reached
the
door
flung
it
open
jumped
through
and
crashed
it
to
again
just
in
time
to
catch
the
imp
fast
half
in
and
half
out
bing
and
billy
had
taken
such
a
leap
up
into
the
air
as
he
had
never
taken
before
chapter
xxi
in
the
queen
bee
palace
on
on
and
on
went
billy
rushing
through
the
air
with
a
speed
he
had
never
before
experienced
the
result
of
the
tremendous
leap
he
had
taken
in
leaving
never
was
bogie
man
squirmed
and
struggled
scratched
and
bit
and
kicked
threatening
billy
with
the
most
horrible
punishment
if
he
did
not
release
him
but
billy
only
held
on
the
tighter
and
answered
never
a
word
for
now
he
knew
what
a
harmless
imitation
he
really
was
unless
seen
through
the
window
of
fear
then
down
down
down
he
dropped
right
into
the
middle
of
a
great
sweet
field
of
red
clover
from
which
arose
the
continuous
of
thousands
of
bees
and
before
him
stood
a
beehive
the
entrance
of
which
he
could
see
was
guarded
by
yellow
jacket
bee
sentries
the
uniform
of
honey
girl
guard
he
cried
excitedly
it
must
be
the
palace
of
the
queen
bee
now
at
last
i
shall
see
honey
girl
saying
this
he
stepped
toward
the
hive
what
are
you
going
to
do
asked
bogie
man
in
alarm
enter
that
hive
and
see
honey
girl
said
billy
oh
but
do
you
see
the
guard
they
will
sting
us
oh
do
do
do
and
you
are
the
bogie
man
everyone
is
afraid
of
said
billy
in
disgust
you
are
a
fine
specimen
are
you
but
you
ca
get
through
that
little
opening
and
here
it
did
look
as
if
there
was
some
reason
in
bogie
man
words
i
can
try
ca
i
said
billy
halt
halt
cried
all
the
bee
sentries
presenting
their
sting
bayonets
i
coming
in
said
billy
preparing
to
jump
you
do
so
at
the
peril
of
your
life
cried
the
principal
sentry
i
have
done
so
many
things
that
way
lately
answered
billy
that
i
quite
grown
used
to
it
halt
halt
i
say
oh
do
please
do
risk
it
remember
i
an
old
man
and
a
sting
might
prove
fatal
and
bogie
man
trembled
like
a
leaf
but
i
a
friend
of
princess
honey
girl
i
not
going
to
harm
her
said
billy
thinking
it
was
at
least
worth
while
attempting
a
friendly
entrance
others
have
said
that
and
stolen
our
golden
walls
and
our
precious
jewelry
even
the
last
drop
of
food
in
the
larder
so
stand
back
several
little
boy
and
girl
bees
had
collected
around
billy
attracted
by
the
sound
of
loud
voices
and
hoping
to
see
a
fight
they
buzzed
at
billy
derisively
and
one
or
two
even
picked
up
clover
tops
to
throw
at
him
he
knew
that
quick
action
was
necessary
if
he
was
to
get
in
without
a
serious
fight
and
at
the
same
time
avoid
a
field
brawl
so
suddenly
he
stepped
back
made
a
quick
leap
directly
at
the
opening
of
the
hive
and
dived
head
foremost
through
it
in
he
popped
past
the
startled
sentries
the
doorway
opening
wide
to
admit
him
not
even
brushing
his
clothes
as
he
entered
he
found
himself
standing
in
the
centre
of
a
great
golden
court
under
a
magnificent
vaulted
dome
magnificent
ah
that
is
too
poor
a
word
to
describe
his
surroundings
billy
had
dreamed
of
beautiful
things
he
had
read
of
glittering
gold
and
showers
of
precious
stones
but
had
all
his
dreams
and
all
his
readings
and
all
the
beautiful
things
he
had
ever
imagined
been
sifted
and
sorted
and
only
the
purest
and
finest
selected
the
result
would
have
been
poor
indeed
as
compared
with
the
interior
of
the
queen
bee
palace
great
diamond
arc
lights
flashed
brilliant
blue
and
white
rays
from
the
ceiling
and
mingled
their
brightness
with
the
soft
yellow
glow
of
topaz
lights
beautiful
yellow
wax
candles
added
their
rich
creamy
light
the
walls
were
of
the
richest
gold
and
instead
of
being
smooth
and
bore
the
shape
of
honeycomb
each
cell
of
which
showed
a
distinctive
beauty
illustration
me
to
present
bogie
page
the
smooth
wax
floor
giving
just
enough
at
each
step
to
make
walking
a
springy
elastic
pleasure
was
carpeted
down
the
centre
with
a
strip
of
soft
yellow
rosebud
leaves
and
this
carpet
led
to
the
throne
which
was
carved
from
one
enormous
block
of
amber
but
when
billy
gaze
had
travelled
this
far
he
had
eyes
for
nothing
else
in
his
sight
the
lights
faded
to
mere
sparks
the
golden
walls
lost
their
richness
the
throne
became
but
a
wooden
chair
for
seated
there
before
him
was
honey
girl
so
radiant
so
dazzlingly
beautiful
that
mere
gold
and
jewelry
were
as
nothing
compared
with
her
honey
girl
he
cried
billy
bounce
exclaimed
she
and
her
voice
was
as
full
of
gladness
as
billy
on
the
throne
yes
my
aunt
the
queen
bee
felt
that
she
was
growing
old
and
to
protect
me
further
from
nickel
plate
and
bogie
man
abdicated
and
made
me
queen
you
need
not
have
feared
them
said
billy
allow
me
to
present
bogie
man
bogie
man
said
the
princess
or
rather
the
queen
in
surprise
surely
you
are
mistaken
why
bogie
man
is
a
monster
yes
oh
queen
said
bogie
man
humbly
i
used
to
was
everybody
thought
i
was
a
terrible
fellow
but
now
that
billy
bounce
has
discovered
me
i
a
broken
old
man
who
would
hurt
a
fly
unless
it
woke
me
too
early
in
the
morning
brave
billy
bounce
whispered
honey
girl
what
he
says
is
true
said
billy
and
then
added
modestly
but
i
am
not
brave
i
just
somehow
guessed
that
bad
things
and
the
unseen
things
that
people
fear
are
mostly
nothing
at
all
when
a
fellow
faces
them
but
few
face
them
as
you
have
done
billy
bounce
and
began
the
queen
when
suddenly
a
great
uproar
broke
out
in
the
palace
in
rushed
general
merchandise
followed
by
the
yellow
jacket
guard
close
on
their
heels
came
a
company
of
borer
bees
carrying
their
ground
augers
at
charge
bayonets
then
came
a
brigade
of
fighting
ants
their
black
armor
shining
in
the
light
next
the
fierce
wasp
grenadiers
the
tallest
soldiers
in
the
army
looking
very
trim
and
military
with
their
thin
waists
and
broad
shoulders
then
in
came
the
horse
fly
cavalry
followed
by
the
tumble
bug
artillery
each
soldier
rolling
his
own
cannon
ball
and
such
a
fierce
buzz
as
arose
from
their
ranks
officers
buzzing
orders
orderlies
and
aides
running
and
riding
back
and
forth
indeed
had
not
the
palace
been
enormous
i
ca
imagine
how
it
would
have
held
the
army
and
its
noise
what
does
this
intrusion
mean
asked
honey
girl
rising
general
merchandise
i
await
your
answer
it
means
said
the
general
excitedly
that
our
spies
the
mosquito
brothers
inform
us
that
this
boy
pointing
to
billy
bounce
has
smuggled
bogie
man
into
the
palace
and
if
that
be
true

pointed
to

the
general

surprise

billy
but

general
merchandise

it
said
honey
girl
you
did
then
you
are
our
friend
ho
guards
unseize
him
and
the
general
warmly
shook
billy
hand
while
the
soldiers
saluted
and
went
back
to
their
company
at
that
moment
a
door
opened
and
in
walked
the
sentry
closely
guarding
nickel
plate
bumbus
drone
and
glucose
what
does
this
mean
asked
general
merchandise
four
tramps
who
called
at
the
kitchen
door
for
a
crumb
of
water
and
a
drop
of
bread
we
arrested
them
as
suspicious
characters
said
the
head
sentry
and
tramps
and
characters
they
undoubtedly
were
nickel
plate
with
all
the
starch
gone
out
of
his
face
as
rusty
as
an
old
his
monocle
broken
and
his
patent
leather
boots
bursted
and
run
down
at
the
heels
bumbus
with
his
moustache
out
of
curl
his
hat
dented
and
rimless
his
trousers
baggy
at
the
knees
and
his
eyes
bleary
and
bloodshot
from
lack
of
sleep
drone
well
it
is
hard
to
say
what
drone
did
look
like
excepting
that
he
carried
a
tomato
can
over
one
shoulder
and
his
clothes
showed
signs
of
many
nights
spent
on
park
benches
and
glucose
was
fully
as
disreputable
all
the
plating
was
worn
off
of
her
comb
her
dress
was
in
tatters
and
she
bore
a
big
label
slung
around
her
neck
with
these
words
glucose
by
order
of
the
pure
food
commission
nickel
plate
bumbus
drone
and
glucose
cried
billy
grown
rusty
said
nickel
plate
sadly
i
be
murmured
bumbus
i
ai
had
a
bite
to
eat
for
three
days
whined
drone
ca
you
give
a
poor
man
a
dime
for
a
bed
and
that
the
way
i
used
to
look
said
glucose
bitterly
pointing
at
honey
girl
it
is
what
you
used
to
be
it
what
you
put
in
the
bank
said
gas
genially
as
he
floated
in
through
the
open
door
and
now
that
all
of
our
enemies
are
here
said
general
merchandise
what
shall
we
do
with
them
speak
up
billy
bounce
said
gas
i
said
billy
yes
said
honey
girl
you
have
vanquished
them
you
shall
decide
their
fate
then
my
first
suggestion
said
billy
is
that
bogie
man
get
a
position
as
bogie
on
the
golf
links
he
will
be
out
of
mischief
there
and
it
will
give
him
a
decent
honest
living
are
you
willing
bogie
man
i
try
it
said
bogie
man
humbly
it
been
so
long
since
i
made
an
honest
living
that
it
will
go
hard
at
first
but
one
must
eat
and
i
out
of
a
job
good
said
honey
girl
general
take
him
to
one
side
and
bring
forward
the
next
prisoner
nickel
plate
was
brought
before
billy
as
to
nickel
plate
said
billy
i
suggest
that
he
go
on
the
stage
he
can
have
all
the
fun
of
trying
to
be
wicked
without
doing
any
possible
harm
and
is
always
sure
there
to
be
foiled
in
the
last
act
wise
boy
said
gas
i
could
have
done
better
myself
thanks
said
nickel
plate
you
let
me
off
very
easily
and
he
walked
dejectedly
to
where
bogie
man
stood
and
now
for
bumbus
said
honey
girl
are
you
sorry
for
your
wickedness
asked
billy
i
be
said
bumbus
you
are
stout
and
strong
said
billy
musingly
you
have
a
bad
heart
and
you
know
something
about
fighting
general
merchandise
could
you
put
him
on
your
police
force
certainly
said
the
general
good
said
billy
that
settles
a
life
job
on
bumbus
and
now
for
drone
i
do
have
to
go
to
work
do
i
whined
drone
indeed
you
do
and
i
going
to
get
you
a
position
as
a
truckman
among
the
bee
workers
then
i
would
be
a
drone
whimpered
he
exactly
said
billy
there
is
no
room
in
this
world
for
drones
general
let
some
of
your
soldiers
give
him
a
shave
a
bath
a
square
meal
some
respectable
clothes
and
put
him
to
work
and
drone
was
led
away
feebly
protesting
but
encouraged
already
by
the
promise
of
something
to
eat
and
glucose
cried
honey
girl
i
shall
take
care
of
ladies
bowing
to
her
court
ladies
who
surrounded
the
throne
glucose
will
be
my
understudy
when
i
feel
sick
and
tired
and
headachy
she
will
attend
court
for
me
and
that
she
may
never
again
enter
into
a
conspiracy
to
rob
me
of
my
throne
she
shall
always
wear
her
label
but
under
her
dress
glucose
fell
on
her
knees
at
honey
girl
feet
and
covered
her
hands
with
kisses
let
me
be
always
your
servant
dear
queen
and
i
will
prove
that
there
is
some
good
in
glucose
after
all
every
one
was
much
affected
by
her
repentance
and
was
convinced
that
thereafter
she
would
lead
a
good
and
useful
life
which
i
am
glad
to
say
she
did
and
now
billy
bounce
for
your
reward
said
honey
girl
i
ask
no
reward
said
billy
earnestly
except
that
some
day
when
i
am
grown
up
and
general
manager
of
the
messenger
service
you
will
marry
me
honey
girl
blushed
and
hung
her
head
at
this
unexpected
reply
and
then
smiling
at
billy
said
maybe
hurrah
maybe
is
will
be
in
beeland
cried
everybody
and
gas
shook
billy
warmly
by
the
hand
and
whispered
that
what
comes
of
keeping
your
courage
up
is
it
looking
too
far
ahead
to
say
that
one
day
honey
girl
and
billy
did
marry
and
of
course
lived
happily
all
the
rest
of
their
days
while
barker
with
the
aid
of
the
soldiers
guarded
the
palace
and
every
night
barked
up
the
singing
tree
which
with
its
beautiful
music
gave
much
pleasure
and
delight
to
billy
and
the
princess
well
it
true
anyway
so
we
will
say
so
