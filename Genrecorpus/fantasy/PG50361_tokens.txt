caught

in

golden
swordfish
first
the
hall
of
public
chargers
of
the
horse
chapter
one
that
going
to
the
seaside
was
the
very
beginning
of
it
seemed
as
though
it
were
going
to
be
a
beginning
without
an
end
like
the
roads
on
the
sussex
downs
which
look
like
roads
and
then
look
like
paths
and
then
turn
into
sheep
tracks
and
then
are
just
grass
and
furze
bushes
and
tottergrass
and
harebells
and
rabbits
and
chalk
the
children
had
been
counting
the
days
to
the
day
bernard
indeed
had
made
a
calendar
on
a
piece
of
cardboard
that
had
once
been
the
bottom
of
the
box
in
which
his
new
white
sandshoes
came
home
he
marked
the
divisions
of
the
weeks
quite
neatly
in
red
ink
and
the
days
were
numbered
in
blue
ink
and
every
day
he
crossed
off
one
of
those
numbers
with
a
piece
of
green
chalk
he
happened
to
have
left
out
of
a
penny
box
mavis
had
washed
and
ironed
all
the
dolls
clothes
at
least
a
fortnight
before
the
day
this
was
thoughtful
and
farsighted
of
her
of
course
but
it
was
a
little
trying
to
kathleen
who
was
much
younger
and
who
would
have
preferred
to
go
on
playing
with
her
dolls
in
their
dirtier
and
more
familiar
state
well
if
you
do
said
mavis
a
little
hot
and
cross
from
the
ironing
board
i
ll
never
wash
anything
for
you
again
not
even
your
kathleen
somehow
felt
as
if
she
could
bear
that
but
mayn
t
i
have
just
one
of
the
dolls
was
however
all
she
said
just
the
teeniest
weeniest
one
let
me
have
lord
edward
his
head
s
half
gone
as
it
is
and
i
could
dress
him
in
a
clean
hanky
and
pretend
it
was
mavis
could
not
object
to
this
because
of
course
whatever
else
she
washed
she
didn
t
wash
hankies
so
lord
edward
had
his
pale
kilts
and
the
other
dolls
were
put
away
in
a
row
in
mavis
s
corner
drawer
it
was
after
that
that
mavis
and
francis
had
long
secret
when
the
younger
ones
asked
questions
they
were
told
it
s
secrets
you
ll
know
in
good
this
of
course
excited
everyone
very
much
it
was
rather
a
comedown
when
the
good
time
came
and
the
secret
proved
to
be
nothing
more
interesting
than
a
large
empty
aquarium
which
the
two
elders
had
clubbed
their
money
together
to
buy
for
ninepence
in
the
old
kent
road
they
staggered
up
the
front
garden
path
with
it
very
hot
and
tired
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
kathleen
asked
as
they
all
stood
around
the
nursery
table
looking
at
it
fill
it
with
seawater
francis
explained
to
put
sea
anemones
oh
yes
said
kathleen
with
enthusiasm
and
the
crabs
and
starfish
and
prawns
and
the
yellow
all
the
common
objects
of
the
we
ll
stand
it
in
the
window
mavis
added
it
ll
make
the
lodgings
look
so
and
then
perhaps
some
great
scientific
gentleman
like
darwin
or
faraday
will
see
it
as
he
goes
by
and
it
will
be
such
a
joyous
surprise
to
him
to
come
with
our
jellyfish
he
ll
offer
to
teach
francis
all
about
science
for
see
said
kathleen
hopefully
but
how
will
you
get
it
to
the
seaside
bernard
asked
leaning
his
hands
on
the
schoolroom
table
and
breathing
heavily
into
the
aquarium
so
that
its
shining
sides
became
dim
and
misty
it
s
much
too
big
to
go
in
the
boxes
you
then
i
ll
carry
it
said
francis
it
won
t
be
in
the
way
at
carried
it
home
we
had
to
take
the
bus
you
know
said
truthful
mavis
and
then
i
had
to
help
i
don
t
believe
they
ll
let
you
take
it
at
all
said
you
know
anything
of
you
will
know
that
bernard
proved
to
be
quite
right
take
an
aquarium
to
the
they
said
and
what
for
not
waiting
for
the
answer
they
just
at
present
was
aunt
enid
francis
had
always
been
passionately
fond
of
water
even
when
he
was
a
baby
he
always
stopped
crying
the
moment
they
put
him
in
the
bath
and
he
was
the
little
boy
who
at
the
age
of
four
was
lost
for
three
hours
and
then
brought
home
by
the
police
who
had
found
him
sitting
in
a
horse
trough
in
front
of
the
willing
mind
wet
to
the
topmost
hair
of
his
head
and
quite
happy
entertaining
a
circle
of
carters
with
pots
of
beer
in
their
hands
there
was
very
little
water
in
the
horse
trough
and
the
most
talkative
of
the
carters
explained
that
the
kid
being
that
wet
at
the
first
start
off
him
and
his
mates
thought
he
was
as
safe
in
the
trough
as
weather
being
what
it
was
and
all
them
nasty
motors
and
trams
about
to
francis
passionately
attracted
as
he
was
by
water
in
all
forms
from
the
simple
mud
puddle
to
the
complicated
machinery
by
which
your
bath
supply
is
enabled
to
get
out
of
order
it
was
a
real
tragedy
that
he
had
never
seen
the
sea
something
had
always
happened
to
prevent
it
holidays
had
been
spent
in
green
countries
where
there
were
rivers
and
wells
and
ponds
and
waters
deep
and
the
water
had
been
fresh
water
and
the
green
grass
had
been
on
each
side
of
it
one
great
charm
of
the
sea
as
he
had
heard
of
it
was
that
it
had
nothing
on
the
other
side
so
far
as
eye
could
there
was
a
lot
about
the
sea
in
poetry
and
francis
curiously
enough
liked
poetry
the
buying
of
the
aquarium
had
been
an
attempt
to
make
sure
that
having
found
the
sea
he
should
not
lose
it
again
he
imagined
the
aquarium
fitted
with
a
real
rock
in
the
middle
to
which
radiant
sea
anemones
clung
and
limpets
stuck
there
were
to
be
yellow
periwinkles
too
and
seaweeds
and
gold
and
silver
fish
which
don
t
live
in
the
sea
by
the
way
only
francis
didn
t
know
this
flitting
about
in
radiant
scaly
splendor
among
the
shadows
of
the
growing
water
plants
he
had
thought
it
all
a
cover
might
be
made
very
light
with
rubber
in
between
like
a
bottle
to
keep
the
water
in
while
it
traveled
home
in
the
guard
s
van
to
the
admiration
of
passengers
and
porters
at
both
stations
and
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
take
it
he
told
mavis
and
she
agreed
with
him
that
it
was
a
shame
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
she
said
for
she
was
not
one
of
those
comforters
who
just
say
i
m
sorry
and
don
t
try
to
help
she
generally
thought
of
something
that
would
make
things
at
any
rate
just
a
little
better
let
s
fill
it
with
fresh
water
and
get
some
goldfish
and
sand
and
weeds
and
i
ll
make
eliza
promise
to
put
ants
eggs
s
what
they
it
ll
be
something
to
break
the
dreadful
shock
when
we
have
to
leave
the
sea
and
come
home
francis
admitted
that
there
was
something
in
this
and
consented
to
fill
the
aquarium
with
water
from
the
bath
when
this
was
done
the
aquarium
was
so
heavy
that
the
combined
efforts
of
all
four
children
could
not
begin
to
move
it
never
mind
said
mavis
the
consoler
let
s
empty
it
out
again
and
take
it
back
to
the
common
room
and
then
fill
it
by
secret
jugfuls
carried
separately
you
this
might
have
been
successful
but
aunt
enid
met
the
first
secret
forbade
the
second
messing
about
she
called
it
no
of
course
i
shan
t
allow
you
to
waste
your
money
on
and
mother
was
already
at
the
seaside
getting
the
lodgings
ready
for
them
her
last
words
had
be
sure
you
do
exactly
what
aunt
enid
so
of
course
they
had
to
also
mother
had
said
don
t
argue
so
they
had
not
even
the
melancholy
satisfaction
of
telling
aunt
enid
that
she
was
quite
wrong
and
that
they
were
not
messing
about
at
all
aunt
enid
was
not
a
real
aunt
but
just
an
old
friend
of
grandmamma
s
with
an
aunt
s
name
and
privileges
and
rather
more
than
an
aunt
s
authority
she
was
much
older
than
a
real
aunt
and
not
half
so
nice
she
was
what
is
called
firm
with
children
and
no
one
ever
called
her
auntie
just
aunt
enid
that
will
tell
you
in
a
moment
so
there
the
aquarium
was
dishearteningly
even
the
few
drops
left
in
it
from
its
first
filling
dried
up
almost
at
once
even
in
its
unwatery
state
however
the
aquarium
was
beautiful
it
had
not
any
of
that
ugly
ironwork
with
red
lead
showing
between
the
iron
and
the
glass
which
you
may
sometimes
have
noticed
in
the
aquariums
of
your
friends
no
it
was
one
solid
thick
piece
of
clear
glass
faintly
green
and
when
you
stooped
down
and
looked
through
you
could
almost
fancy
that
there
really
was
water
in
it
let
s
put
flowers
in
it
kathleen
suggested
and
pretend
they
re
anemones
do
let
s
i
don
t
care
what
you
do
said
francis
i
m
going
to
read
water
then
we
ll
do
it
and
make
it
a
lovely
surprise
for
you
said
kathleen
cheerily
francis
sat
down
squarely
with
water
flat
before
him
on
the
table
where
also
his
elbows
were
and
the
others
respecting
his
sorrow
stole
quietly
away
mavis
just
stepped
back
to
say
i
say
france
you
don
t
mind
their
putting
flowers
it
s
to
please
you
you
i
tell
you
i
don
t
mind
said
francis
savagely
when
the
three
had
finished
with
it
the
aquarium
really
looked
rather
nice
and
if
you
stooped
down
and
looked
sideways
through
the
glass
like
a
real
aquarium
kathleen
took
some
clinkers
from
the
back
of
the
where
they
won
t
show
she
mavis
induced
these
to
stand
up
like
an
arch
in
the
middle
of
the
glassy
square
tufts
of
long
grass
rather
sparingly
arranged
looked
not
unlike
waterweed
bernard
begged
from
the
cook
some
of
the
fine
silver
sand
which
she
uses
to
scrub
the
kitchen
tables
and
dressers
with
and
mavis
cut
the
thread
of
the
australian
shell
necklace
that
uncle
robert
sent
her
last
christmas
so
that
there
should
be
real
shimmery
silvery
shells
on
the
sand
this
was
rather
of
her
because
she
knew
she
would
have
to
put
them
all
back
again
on
their
string
and
you
know
what
a
bother
shells
are
to
thread
they
shone
delightfully
through
the
glass
but
the
great
triumph
was
the
sea
and
red
and
to
the
rocky
arch
just
as
though
they
were
growing
there
oh
lovely
lovely
kathleen
cried
as
mavis
fixed
the
last
delicate
crown
come
and
look
not
yet
said
mavis
in
a
great
hurry
and
she
tied
the
thread
of
the
necklace
round
a
tin
goldfish
out
of
the
box
with
the
duck
and
the
boat
and
the
mackerel
and
the
lobster
and
the
magnet
that
makes
them
all
move
know
and
hung
it
from
the
middle
of
the
arch
it
looked
just
as
though
it
were
hardly
noticed
the
thread
at
all
france
she
called
and
francis
came
slowly
with
his
thumb
in
water
it
was
nearly
dark
by
now
but
mavis
had
lighted
the
four
dollhouse
candles
in
the
gilt
candlesticks
and
set
them
on
the
table
around
the
aquarium
look
through
the
side
she
said
isn
t
it
ripping
why
said
francis
slowly
you
ve
got
water
in
real
anemones
where
on
earth
not
real
said
mavis
i
wish
they
were
they
re
only
dahlias
but
it
does
look
pretty
doesn
t
it
it
s
like
fairyland
said
kathleen
and
bernard
added
i
glad
you
bought
it
just
shows
what
it
will
be
like
when
we
get
the
sea
creatures
said
mavis
oh
francis
you
do
like
it
don
t
you
oh
i
like
it
all
right
he
answered
pressing
his
nose
against
the
thick
glass
but
i
wanted
it
to
be
waving
weeds
and
mysterious
wetness
like
the
sabrina
the
other
three
glanced
at
the
picture
which
hung
over
the
and
the
water
nymphs
drifting
along
among
the
waterweeds
and
water
lilies
there
were
words
under
the
picture
and
francis
dreamily
began
to
say
them
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
the
glassie
cool
translucent
wave
in
twisted
braids
of
lillies
knitting
the
loose
train
of
thy
hair
was
that
he
said
in
quite
a
different
voice
and
jumped
up
what
was
what
the
others
naturally
asked
did
you
put
something
alive
in
there
francis
asked
of
course
not
said
mavis
why
well
i
saw
something
move
that
s
they
all
crowded
around
and
peered
over
the
glass
walls
nothing
of
course
but
the
sand
and
the
grass
and
the
shells
the
clinkers
and
the
dahlias
and
the
little
suspended
tin
goldfish
i
expect
the
goldfish
swung
a
bit
said
bernard
that
s
what
it
must
have
it
didn
t
look
like
that
francis
answered
it
looked
more
like
what
i
don
t
out
of
the
light
let
s
have
another
he
stooped
down
and
looked
again
through
the
glass
it
s
not
the
goldfish
he
said
that
s
as
quiet
as
a
trout
asleep
suppose
it
was
a
shadow
or
you
might
tell
us
what
it
looked
like
said
kathleen
was
it
like
a
rat
bernard
asked
with
interest
not
a
bit
it
was
more
well
like
what
asked
three
aggravated
voices
like
very
very
a
sort
of
said
kathleen
how
awfully
jolly
it
wasn
t
at
all
like
a
doll
and
it
wasn
t
jolly
said
francis
only
i
wish
it
would
come
it
didn
t
however
i
say
said
mavis
struck
by
a
new
idea
perhaps
it
s
a
magic
let
s
play
it
is
suggested
let
s
play
it
s
a
magic
glass
and
we
can
see
what
we
like
in
it
i
see
a
fairy
palace
with
gleaming
spires
of
crystal
and
i
see
a
football
match
and
our
chaps
winning
said
bernard
heavily
joining
in
the
new
game
shut
up
said
francis
that
isn
t
play
there
was
suppose
it
is
magic
said
mavis
again
we
ve
played
magic
so
often
and
nothing
s
ever
when
we
made
the
fire
of
woods
and
eastern
gums
and
all
that
said
bernard
it
s
much
better
to
pretend
right
away
we
always
have
to
in
the
end
magic
just
wastes
time
there
isn
t
any
magic
really
is
there
mavis
shut
up
i
tell
you
was
the
only
answer
of
francis
his
nose
now
once
more
flattened
against
the
smooth
green
glass
here
aunt
enid
s
voice
was
heard
on
the
landing
outside
saying
little
in
no
uncertain
tones
the
two
grunted
as
it
were
in
whispers
but
there
was
no
appeal
against
aunt
enid
and
they
went
their
grunts
growing
feebler
as
they
crossed
the
room
and
dying
away
in
a
despairing
silence
as
they
and
aunt
enid
met
abruptly
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
shut
the
door
said
francis
in
a
strained
sort
of
voice
and
mavis
obeyed
even
though
he
hadn
t
said
she
really
was
an
excellent
sister
francis
in
moments
of
weakness
had
gone
so
far
as
to
admit
that
she
wasn
t
half
bad
i
say
she
said
when
the
click
of
the
latch
assured
her
that
they
were
alone
how
could
it
be
magic
we
never
said
any
no
more
we
did
said
francis
besides
it
s
all
nonsense
of
course
about
magic
it
s
just
a
game
we
play
isn
t
it
yes
of
course
mavis
said
doubtfully
but
what
did
you
mean
by
unless
we
weren
t
saying
any
spells
were
we
no
of
course
we
weren
weren
t
saying
as
it
happens
was
what
when
when
it
what
happened
will
it
be
believed
that
aunt
enid
chose
this
moment
for
opening
the
door
just
wide
enough
to
say
and
mavis
had
to
go
but
as
she
went
she
said
again
what
happened
said
francis
whatever
it
was
i
was
saying
mavis
called
aunt
enid
yes
aunt
were
saying
i
was
saying
said
francis
do
you
of
course
it
couldn
t
have
all
dry
like
that
no
water
or
perhaps
magic
to
be
dry
said
mavis
coming
aunt
enid
it
seems
to
be
mostly
burning
things
and
of
course
that
wouldn
t
do
in
the
water
what
you
see
it
looked
like
sabrina
said
only
tiny
tiny
not
you
know
but
like
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
i
do
wish
you
d
seen
say
sabrina
fair
again
quick
while
i
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
oh
mavis
it
did
there
s
something
there
truly
look
where
said
mavis
i
can
t
let
me
mavis
called
aunt
enid
very
loud
indeed
and
mavis
tore
herself
away
i
must
go
she
said
never
mind
we
ll
look
again
tomorrow
oh
france
if
it
i
ll
tell
you
but
she
never
told
him
what
for
aunt
enid
swept
in
and
swept
out
bearing
mavis
away
as
it
were
in
a
whirlwind
of
impatient
exasperation
and
without
seeming
to
stop
to
do
it
blowing
out
the
four
candles
as
she
came
and
went
at
the
door
she
turned
to
say
good
night
francis
your
bath
s
turned
on
ready
be
sure
you
wash
well
behind
your
ears
we
shan
t
have
much
time
in
the
but
mavis
always
bathes
first
said
he
i
m
the
don
t
argue
child
for
goodness
sake
said
aunt
enid
mavis
is
having
the
flat
bath
in
my
bedroom
to
save
time
nonsense
she
paused
at
the
door
to
say
let
me
see
you
go
right
about
march
and
he
had
to
if
she
must
pretend
to
give
orders
like
drill
she
might
at
least
learn
to
say
bout
turn
he
reflected
struggling
with
his
collar
stud
in
the
steaming
bathroom
never
mind
i
ll
get
up
early
and
see
if
i
can
t
see
it
and
so
he
early
as
he
was
aunt
enid
and
the
servants
were
earlier
the
aquarium
was
clean
shining
and
quite
empty
aunt
enid
could
not
understand
why
francis
ate
so
little
breakfast
what
has
she
done
with
them
he
wondered
later
know
said
bernard
solemnly
she
told
esther
to
put
them
on
the
kitchen
only
just
saved
my
and
what
about
my
shells
asked
mavis
in
sudden
fear
oh
she
took
those
to
take
care
of
said
you
weren
t
old
enough
to
take
care
of
them
you
will
wonder
why
the
children
did
not
ask
their
aunt
enid
right
out
what
had
become
of
the
contents
of
the
aquarium
well
you
don
t
know
their
aunt
enid
and
besides
even
on
that
first
morning
before
anything
that
really
anything
could
be
said
to
have
after
all
what
francis
said
he
had
seen
might
have
been
just
was
a
sort
of
misty
curious
trembling
feeling
at
the
hearts
of
mavis
and
her
brother
which
made
them
feel
that
they
did
not
want
to
talk
about
the
aquarium
and
what
had
been
in
it
to
any
least
of
all
to
their
aunt
enid
and
leaving
the
aquarium
that
was
the
hardest
thing
of
all
they
thought
of
telegraphing
to
mother
to
ask
whether
after
all
they
mightn
t
bring
there
was
first
the
difficulty
of
wording
a
telegram
so
that
their
mother
would
understand
and
not
deem
it
insanity
or
a
practical
the
fact
that
which
was
all
they
had
between
them
would
not
cover
the
baldest
statement
of
the
facts
desmond
care
of
mrs
pearce
east
cliff
villa
lewis
road
west
alone
would
be
the
simplest
appeal
such
as
may
we
bring
aquarium
please
say
yes
wire
reply
brought
the
whole
thing
hopelessly
beyond
their
means
it
s
no
good
said
francis
hopelessly
and
anyway
said
kathleen
there
wouldn
t
be
time
to
get
an
answer
before
we
no
one
had
thought
of
this
it
was
a
sort
of
backhanded
consolation
but
think
of
coming
back
to
it
said
mavis
it
ll
be
something
to
live
for
when
we
come
back
from
the
sea
and
everything
else
is
and
it
was
chapter
two
the
delicate
pinkish
bloom
of
newness
was
on
the
wooden
spades
the
slick
smoothness
of
the
painted
pails
showed
neither
scratch
nor
dent
on
their
green
and
scarlet
shrimping
nets
were
full
and
fluffy
as
once
they
and
sand
and
water
had
met
they
never
could
be
again
the
pails
and
spades
and
nets
formed
the
topmost
layer
of
a
pile
of
know
the
sort
of
thing
with
the
big
boxes
at
the
bottom
and
the
carryall
bulging
with
its
wraps
and
mackers
the
old
portmanteau
that
shows
its
striped
lining
through
the
crack
and
is
so
useful
for
putting
boots
in
and
the
sponge
bag
and
all
the
little
things
that
get
left
out
you
can
almost
always
squeeze
a
ball
or
a
paint
box
or
a
box
of
chalks
or
any
of
those
say
you
won
t
really
want
till
you
come
that
old
then
when
it
s
being
unpacked
at
the
journey
s
end
the
most
that
can
happen
will
be
that
someone
will
say
i
thought
i
told
you
not
to
bring
that
and
if
you
don
t
answer
back
that
will
be
all
but
most
likely
in
the
agitation
of
unpacking
and
settling
in
your
tennis
ball
or
pencil
box
or
whatever
it
is
will
pass
unnoticed
of
course
you
can
t
shove
an
aquarium
into
the
old
a
pair
of
rabbits
nor
a
anything
in
reason
you
can
the
luggage
that
goes
in
the
van
is
not
much
course
it
has
to
be
packed
and
to
be
strapped
and
labeled
and
looked
after
at
the
junction
but
apart
from
that
the
big
luggage
behaves
itself
keeps
itself
to
itself
and
like
your
elder
brothers
at
college
never
occasions
its
friends
a
moment
s
anxiety
it
is
the
younger
fry
of
the
luggage
family
the
things
you
have
with
you
in
the
carriage
that
are
bundle
of
umbrellas
and
walking
sticks
the
golf
clubs
the
rugs
the
greatcoats
the
basket
of
things
to
eat
the
books
you
are
going
to
read
in
the
train
and
as
often
as
not
you
never
look
at
them
the
newspapers
that
the
are
tired
of
and
yet
don
t
want
to
throw
away
their
little
bags
or
dispatch
cases
and
suitcases
and
card
cases
and
scarfs
and
the
children
were
traveling
under
the
care
of
aunt
enid
who
always
had
far
more
of
these
tiresome
odds
and
ends
than
mother
it
was
at
the
last
moment
when
the
cab
was
almost
to
be
expected
to
be
there
that
aunt
enid
rushed
out
to
the
corner
shop
and
returned
with
four
new
spades
four
new
pails
and
four
new
shrimping
nets
and
presented
them
to
the
children
just
in
time
for
them
to
be
added
to
the
heap
of
odds
and
ends
with
which
the
cab
was
filled
up
i
hope
it
s
not
ungrateful
said
mavis
at
the
station
as
they
stood
waiting
by
the
luggage
mound
while
aunt
enid
went
to
take
the
but
why
couldn
t
she
have
bought
them
at
beachfield
makes
us
look
such
babies
said
francis
who
would
not
be
above
using
a
wooden
spade
at
the
proper
time
and
place
but
did
not
care
to
be
branded
in
the
face
of
all
waterloo
junction
as
one
of
those
kids
off
to
the
seaside
with
little
spades
and
pails
kathleen
and
bernard
were
however
young
enough
to
derive
a
certain
pleasure
from
stroking
the
smooth
curved
surface
of
the
spades
till
aunt
enid
came
fussing
back
with
the
tickets
and
told
them
to
put
their
gloves
on
for
goodness
sake
and
try
not
to
look
like
street
children
i
am
sorry
that
the
first
thing
you
should
hear
about
the
children
should
be
that
they
did
not
care
about
their
aunt
enid
but
this
was
unfortunately
the
case
and
if
you
think
this
was
not
nice
of
them
i
can
only
remind
you
that
you
do
not
know
their
aunt
enid
there
was
a
short
sharp
struggle
with
the
porter
a
flustered
passage
along
the
platform
and
the
children
were
safe
in
the
carriage
marked
reserved
into
it
as
it
were
with
all
that
small
fry
of
luggage
which
i
have
just
described
then
aunt
enid
fussed
off
again
to
exchange
a
few
last
home
truths
with
the
porter
and
the
children
were
left
we
breathe
again
said
mavis
not
yet
we
don
t
said
francis
there
ll
be
some
more
fuss
as
soon
as
she
comes
back
i
d
almost
as
soon
not
go
to
the
sea
as
go
with
but
you
ve
never
seen
the
sea
mavis
reminded
him
i
know
said
francis
morosely
but
look
at
all
he
indicated
the
tangle
of
their
possessions
which
littered
seats
and
i
do
he
stopped
for
a
head
appeared
in
the
open
a
round
hat
very
like
aunt
enid
it
was
not
aunt
enid
s
the
face
under
the
hat
was
a
much
younger
kinder
one
i
m
afraid
this
carriage
is
reserved
said
the
voice
that
belonged
to
the
face
yes
said
kathleen
but
there
s
lots
of
room
if
you
like
to
come
i
don
t
know
if
the
aunt
we
re
with
would
like
it
said
the
more
cautious
mavis
we
should
of
course
she
added
to
meet
the
kind
smiling
eyes
that
looked
from
under
the
hat
that
was
like
aunt
enid
s
the
lady
said
i
m
an
aunt
m
going
to
meet
my
nephew
at
the
junction
the
train
s
frightfully
crowded
if
i
were
to
talk
to
your
aunt
perhaps
on
the
strength
of
our
common
aunthood
the
train
will
start
in
a
minute
i
haven
t
any
luggage
to
be
a
but
one
had
indeed
a
folded
newspaper
in
her
hands
oh
do
get
in
said
kathleen
dancing
with
anxiety
i
m
sure
aunt
enid
won
t
mind
was
always
suppose
the
train
were
to
start
or
anything
well
if
you
think
i
may
said
the
lady
and
tossed
her
paper
into
the
corner
in
a
lighthearted
way
which
the
children
found
charming
her
pleasant
face
was
rising
in
the
oblong
of
the
carriage
doorway
her
foot
was
on
the
carriage
step
when
suddenly
she
retreated
back
and
down
it
was
almost
as
though
someone
pulled
her
off
the
carriage
step
excuse
me
said
a
voice
this
carriage
is
the
pleasant
face
of
the
lady
disappeared
and
the
face
of
aunt
enid
took
its
place
the
lady
vanished
aunt
enid
trod
on
kathleen
s
foot
pushed
against
bernard
s
waistcoat
sat
down
partly
on
mavis
and
partly
on
francis
and
of
all
the
impertinence
then
someone
banged
the
train
shivered
and
trembled
and
pulled
itself
together
in
the
way
we
all
know
so
snorted
screamed
and
was
off
aunt
enid
stood
up
arranging
things
on
the
rack
so
that
the
children
could
not
even
see
if
the
nice
lady
had
found
a
seat
in
the
train
do
francis
could
not
help
saying
you
said
aunt
enid
i
should
never
have
thought
it
of
when
she
had
arranged
the
things
in
the
rack
to
her
satisfaction
she
pointed
out
a
few
little
faults
that
she
had
noticed
in
the
children
and
settled
down
to
read
a
book
by
miss
marie
corelli
the
children
looked
miserably
at
each
other
they
could
not
understand
why
mother
had
placed
them
under
the
control
of
this
most
unpleasant
mock
aunt
there
was
a
reason
for
it
of
course
if
your
parents
who
are
generally
so
kind
and
jolly
suddenly
do
a
thing
that
you
can
t
understand
and
can
hardly
bear
you
may
be
quite
sure
they
have
a
good
reason
for
it
the
reason
in
this
case
was
that
aunt
enid
was
the
only
person
who
offered
to
take
charge
of
the
children
at
a
time
when
all
the
nice
people
who
usually
did
it
were
having
influenza
also
she
was
an
old
friend
of
granny
s
granny
s
taste
in
friends
must
have
been
very
odd
francis
decided
or
else
aunt
enid
must
have
changed
a
good
deal
since
she
was
young
and
there
she
sat
reading
her
dull
book
the
children
also
had
been
provided
with
or
little
by
or
like
a
little
and
had
been
dealt
out
as
though
they
were
cards
for
a
game
before
leaving
home
they
had
been
a
great
bother
to
carry
and
they
were
impossible
to
read
kathleen
and
bernard
presently
preferred
looking
out
of
the
windows
and
the
two
elder
ones
tried
to
read
the
paper
left
by
the
lady
looking
now
that
is
just
where
it
was
and
really
what
all
that
has
been
written
before
is
about
if
that
lady
hadn
t
happened
to
look
in
at
their
door
and
if
she
hadn
t
happened
to
leave
the
paper
they
would
never
have
seen
it
because
they
weren
t
the
sort
of
children
who
read
papers
except
under
extreme
provocation
you
will
not
find
it
easy
to
believe
and
i
myself
can
t
see
why
it
should
have
happened
but
the
very
first
word
they
saw
in
that
newspaper
was
beachfield
and
the
second
was
on
and
the
third
was
sea
and
the
fifth
was
mermaid
the
fourth
which
came
between
sea
and
mermaid
was
alleged
i
say
said
mavis
let
s
don
t
pull
then
you
can
see
all
right
said
francis
and
this
is
what
they
read
together
mermaid
amazing
story
at
this
season
of
the
year
which
has
come
to
be
designated
the
silly
season
the
public
press
is
deluged
with
puerile
stories
of
gigantic
gooseberries
and
enormous
sea
serpents
so
that
it
is
quite
in
keeping
with
the
weird
traditions
of
this
time
of
the
year
to
find
a
story
of
some
wonder
of
the
deep
arising
even
at
so
a
watering
place
as
beachfield
close
to
an
excellent
golf
course
and
surrounded
by
various
beauty
spots
with
a
thoroughly
revised
water
supply
a
newly
painted
pier
and
three
rival
cinematograph
picture
palaces
beachfield
has
long
been
known
as
a
rising
of
exceptional
attractions
the
quaint
charm
of
its
hold
on
said
francis
this
isn
t
about
any
old
oh
that
ll
be
further
on
said
mavis
i
expect
they
have
to
put
all
that
stuff
in
to
be
polite
to
s
agreeable
promenade
every
modern
convenience
while
preserving
its
quaint
what
does
quaint
mean
and
why
do
they
keep
on
saying
it
i
don
t
think
it
means
anything
said
francis
it
s
just
a
word
they
use
like
weird
and
dainty
you
always
see
it
in
a
newspaper
her
here
she
the
excitement
may
be
better
imagined
than
described
that
s
about
the
we
are
master
wilfred
wilson
the
son
of
a
and
respected
resident
arrived
home
yesterday
evening
in
tears
inquiry
elicited
a
statement
that
he
had
been
paddling
in
the
rock
pools
which
are
to
be
found
in
such
profusion
under
the
west
cliff
when
something
gently
pinched
his
foot
he
feared
that
it
might
be
a
lobster
having
read
that
these
crustaceans
sometimes
attack
the
unwary
intruder
and
he
screamed
so
far
his
story
though
unusual
contains
nothing
inherently
impossible
but
when
he
went
on
to
state
that
a
noise
like
a
lady
speaking
told
him
not
to
cry
and
that
on
looking
down
he
perceived
that
what
held
him
was
a
hand
coming
from
one
of
the
rocks
under
water
his
statement
was
naturally
received
with
some
incredulity
it
was
not
until
a
boating
party
returning
from
a
pleasure
trip
westward
stated
that
they
had
seen
a
curious
sort
of
white
seal
with
a
dark
tail
darting
through
the
clear
water
below
their
boat
that
master
wilfred
s
story
obtained
any
measure
of
what
s
credence
said
mavis
oh
never
mind
it
s
what
you
believe
with
i
think
go
on
said
francis
credence
wilson
who
seems
to
have
urged
an
early
retirement
to
bed
as
a
cure
for
telling
stories
and
getting
his
feet
wet
allowed
his
son
to
rise
and
conduct
him
to
the
scene
of
adventure
but
wilson
though
he
even
went
to
the
length
of
paddling
in
some
of
the
pools
did
not
see
or
feel
any
hands
nor
hear
any
noise
ladylike
or
otherwise
no
doubt
the
seal
theory
is
the
correct
one
a
white
seal
would
be
a
valuable
acquisition
to
the
town
and
would
no
doubt
attract
visitors
several
boats
have
gone
out
some
with
nets
and
some
with
lines
carrerras
a
visitor
from
south
america
has
gone
out
with
a
lariat
which
in
these
latitudes
is
of
course
quite
a
that
s
all
whispered
francis
and
glanced
at
aunt
enid
i
s
he
beckoned
the
others
and
they
screwed
themselves
along
to
that
end
of
the
carriage
farthest
from
the
slumbering
aunt
just
listen
to
this
he
said
then
in
hoarse
undertones
he
read
all
about
the
mermaid
i
say
said
bernard
i
do
hope
it
s
a
seal
i
ve
never
seen
a
i
hope
they
catch
it
said
kathleen
fancy
seeing
a
real
live
if
it
s
a
real
live
mermaid
i
jolly
well
hope
they
don
t
catch
her
said
francis
so
do
i
said
mavis
i
m
certain
she
would
die
in
but
i
ll
tell
you
what
said
francis
we
ll
go
and
look
for
her
first
thing
tomorrow
i
suppose
he
added
thoughtfully
sabrina
was
a
sort
of
she
hasn
t
a
tail
you
know
kathleen
reminded
him
it
isn
t
the
tail
that
makes
the
mermaid
francis
reminded
her
it
s
being
able
to
live
underwater
if
it
was
the
tail
then
mackerels
would
be
and
of
course
they
re
not
see
said
kathleen
i
wish
said
bernard
that
she
d
given
us
bows
and
arrows
instead
of
pails
and
spades
and
then
we
could
have
gone
or
said
kathleen
yes
that
would
have
been
before
francis
and
mavis
could
say
how
shocked
they
were
at
the
idea
of
shooting
mermaids
aunt
enid
woke
up
and
took
the
newspaper
away
from
them
because
newspapers
are
not
fit
reading
for
children
she
was
somehow
the
kind
of
person
before
whom
you
never
talk
about
anything
that
you
really
care
for
and
it
was
impossible
therefore
to
pursue
either
seals
or
mermaids
it
seemed
best
to
read
and
the
rest
of
the
books
it
was
uphill
work
but
the
last
two
remarks
of
bernard
and
kathleen
had
sunk
into
the
minds
of
the
two
elder
children
that
was
why
when
they
had
reached
beachfield
and
found
mother
and
rejoiced
over
her
and
when
aunt
enid
had
unexpectedly
gone
on
by
that
same
train
to
stay
with
her
really
relations
at
bournemouth
they
did
not
say
any
more
to
the
little
ones
about
mermaids
or
seals
but
just
joined
freely
in
the
chorus
of
pleasure
at
aunt
enid
s
departure
i
thought
she
was
going
to
stay
with
us
all
the
time
said
kathleen
oh
mummy
i
am
so
glad
she
isn
why
don
t
you
like
aunt
enid
isn
t
she
kind
all
four
thought
of
the
spades
and
pails
and
shrimping
nets
and
of
and
and
the
other
all
said
then
what
was
it
mother
asked
and
they
could
not
tell
her
it
is
sometimes
awfully
difficult
to
tell
things
to
your
mother
however
much
you
love
her
the
best
francis
could
do
was
see
we
re
not
used
to
and
kathleen
said
i
don
t
think
perhaps
she
s
used
to
being
an
aunt
but
she
was
and
mother
was
wise
and
didn
t
ask
any
more
questions
also
she
at
once
abandoned
an
idea
one
had
had
of
asking
aunt
enid
to
come
and
stay
at
beachfield
for
part
of
the
holidays
and
this
was
just
as
well
for
if
aunt
enid
had
not
passed
out
of
the
story
exactly
when
she
did
there
would
not
have
been
any
story
to
pass
out
of
and
as
she
does
now
pass
out
of
the
story
i
will
say
that
she
thought
she
was
very
kind
and
that
she
meant
extremely
well
there
was
a
little
whispering
between
francis
and
mavis
just
after
tea
and
a
little
more
just
before
bed
but
it
was
tactfully
done
and
the
younger
ones
never
noticed
it
the
lodgings
were
very
little
way
out
of
the
a
villa
at
all
as
everyone
had
feared
i
suppose
the
landlady
thought
it
grander
to
call
it
a
villa
but
it
was
really
a
house
that
had
once
been
a
mill
house
and
was
all
made
of
a
gray
wood
with
a
roof
and
at
the
back
was
the
old
mill
also
gray
and
used
now
for
what
it
was
built
just
as
a
store
for
fishing
nets
and
wheelbarrows
and
old
rabbit
hutches
and
beehives
and
harnesses
and
odds
and
ends
and
the
sack
of
food
for
the
landlady
s
chickens
there
was
a
great
corn
bin
there
must
have
been
in
some
big
some
broken
chairs
and
an
old
wooden
cradle
that
hadn
t
had
any
babies
in
it
since
the
landlady
s
mother
was
a
little
girl
on
any
ordinary
holiday
the
mill
would
have
had
all
the
charm
of
a
magic
palace
for
the
children
with
its
wonderful
collection
of
pleasant
and
unusual
things
to
play
with
but
just
now
all
their
thoughts
were
on
mermaids
and
the
two
elder
ones
decided
that
they
would
go
out
alone
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
look
for
the
mermaid
mavis
woke
francis
up
very
early
indeed
and
they
got
up
and
dressed
quite
quietly
not
washing
i
am
sorry
to
say
because
water
makes
such
a
noise
when
you
pour
it
out
and
i
am
afraid
their
hair
was
not
very
thoroughly
brushed
either
there
was
not
a
soul
stirring
in
the
road
as
they
went
out
unless
you
count
the
mill
cat
who
had
been
out
all
night
and
was
creeping
home
very
tired
and
dusty
looking
and
a
yellowhammer
who
sat
on
a
tree
a
hundred
yards
down
the
road
and
repeated
his
name
over
and
over
again
in
that
conceited
way
yellowhammers
have
until
they
got
close
to
him
and
then
he
wagged
his
tail
impudently
at
them
and
flew
on
to
the
next
tree
where
he
began
to
talk
about
himself
as
loudly
as
ever
this
desire
to
find
the
mermaid
must
have
been
wonderfully
strong
in
francis
for
it
completely
swallowed
the
longing
of
longing
to
see
the
sea
it
had
been
too
dark
the
night
before
to
see
anything
but
the
winking
faces
of
the
houses
as
the
fly
went
past
them
but
now
as
he
and
mavis
ran
noiselessly
down
the
sandy
path
in
their
rubber
shoes
and
turned
the
corner
of
the
road
he
saw
a
great
something
spread
out
in
front
of
him
lit
with
points
of
red
and
gold
fire
where
the
sun
touched
it
he
stopped
mavis
he
said
in
quite
an
odd
voice
that
s
the
yes
she
said
and
stopped
too
it
isn
t
a
bit
what
i
expected
he
said
and
went
on
running
don
t
you
like
it
asked
mavis
running
after
him
said
francis
it
isn
t
the
sort
of
thing
you
when
they
got
down
to
the
shore
the
sands
and
the
pebbles
were
all
wet
because
the
tide
had
just
gone
down
and
there
were
the
rocks
and
the
little
rock
pools
and
the
limpets
and
whelks
and
the
little
yellow
periwinkles
looking
like
particularly
fine
indian
corn
all
scattered
among
the
red
and
the
brown
and
the
green
seaweed
now
this
jolly
said
francis
this
is
jolly
if
you
like
i
almost
wish
we
d
wakened
the
others
it
doesn
t
seem
quite
oh
they
ve
seen
it
before
mavis
said
quite
truly
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
any
good
going
by
fours
to
look
for
mermaids
do
you
besides
said
francis
saying
what
had
been
in
their
thoughts
since
yesterday
in
the
train
kathleen
wanted
to
shoot
mermaids
and
bernard
thought
it
was
seals
they
had
sat
down
and
were
hastily
pulling
off
their
shoes
and
stockings
of
course
said
he
we
shan
t
find
anything
it
isn
t
well
she
said
for
anything
we
jolly
well
know
they
may
have
found
her
already
take
care
how
you
go
over
these
rocks
they
re
awfully
as
if
i
didn
t
know
that
said
he
and
ran
across
the
narrow
strip
of
sand
that
divided
rocks
from
shingle
and
set
his
foot
for
the
first
time
in
the
sea
it
was
only
a
shallow
little
green
and
white
rock
pool
but
it
was
the
sea
all
the
same
i
say
isn
t
it
cold
said
mavis
withdrawing
pink
and
dripping
toes
do
mind
how
you
as
if
said
francis
again
and
sat
down
suddenly
and
splashingly
in
a
large
clear
sparkling
pool
now
i
suppose
we
ve
got
to
go
home
at
once
and
you
change
said
mavis
not
without
bitterness
nonsense
said
francis
getting
up
with
some
difficulty
and
clinging
wetly
to
mavis
to
steady
himself
i
m
quite
dry
you
know
what
colds
are
like
said
mavis
and
staying
indoors
all
day
or
perhaps
bed
and
mustard
plasters
and
gruel
with
butter
in
it
oh
come
along
home
we
should
never
have
found
the
mermaid
it
s
much
too
bright
and
light
and
for
anything
like
magic
to
happen
come
on
home
let
s
just
go
out
to
the
end
of
the
rocks
francis
urged
just
to
see
what
it
s
like
where
the
water
gets
deep
and
the
seaweed
goes
swish
swish
all
long
and
lanky
and
grassy
like
in
the
sabrina
halfway
then
not
more
said
mavis
firmly
it
s
said
and
halfway
they
went
mavis
still
cautious
and
francis
after
his
wetting
almost
showing
off
in
his
fine
carelessness
of
whether
he
went
in
again
or
not
it
was
very
jolly
you
know
how
soft
and
squeezy
the
blobby
kind
of
seaweed
is
to
walk
on
and
how
satin
smooth
is
the
ribbon
kind
how
sharp
are
limpets
especially
when
they
are
covered
with
barnacles
and
how
comparatively
bearable
to
the
foot
are
the
pale
hemispheres
of
the
periwinkle
now
said
mavis
come
on
back
we
ll
run
all
the
way
as
soon
as
we
get
our
shoes
and
stockings
on
for
fear
of
i
almost
wish
we
hadn
t
come
said
francis
turning
with
a
face
of
gloom
you
didn
t
really
think
we
should
find
a
mermaid
did
you
mavis
asked
and
laughed
though
she
was
really
annoyed
with
francis
for
getting
wet
and
cutting
short
this
exciting
morning
game
but
she
was
a
good
sister
it
s
all
been
so
silly
flopping
into
that
pool
and
talking
and
rotting
and
just
walking
out
and
in
again
we
ought
to
have
come
by
moonlight
and
been
very
quiet
and
serious
and
fair
listen
where
thou
art
on
a
minute
i
ve
caught
my
foot
in
mavis
stopped
and
took
hold
of
her
brother
s
arm
to
steady
him
and
as
she
did
so
both
children
plainly
heard
a
voice
that
was
not
the
voice
of
either
of
them
it
was
the
sweetest
voice
in
the
world
they
thought
and
it
said
save
her
we
die
in
francis
looked
down
and
had
a
sort
of
sudden
sight
of
something
white
and
brown
and
green
that
moved
and
went
quickly
down
under
the
stone
on
which
mavis
was
standing
there
was
nothing
now
holding
his
foot
i
say
he
said
on
a
deep
breath
of
awe
and
wonder
did
you
hear
that
of
course
i
heard
we
couldn
t
both
have
fancied
it
he
said
i
wish
it
had
told
us
who
to
save
and
where
and
whose
do
you
think
that
voice
was
mavis
asked
softly
the
mermaid
s
said
francis
who
else
s
could
it
have
been
illustration
die
in
then
the
magic
s
really
mermaids
aren
t
magic
he
said
anymore
than
flying
fishes
or
giraffes
but
she
came
when
you
said
sabrina
fair
said
mavis
sabrina
wasn
t
a
mermaid
said
francis
firmly
it
s
no
use
trying
to
join
things
on
when
they
won
t
come
on
we
may
as
well
be
getting
mightn
t
she
be
suggested
mavis
a
mermaid
i
mean
like
salmon
that
live
in
rivers
and
go
down
to
the
i
say
i
never
thought
of
that
how
simply
ripping
if
it
turned
out
to
be
really
t
it
be
but
which
do
you
suppose
could
be
one
who
spoke
to
us
or
the
one
she
s
afraid
will
die
in
one
she
wants
us
to
they
had
reached
the
shore
by
now
and
mavis
looked
up
from
turning
her
brown
stockings
right
way
out
to
say
i
suppose
we
didn
t
really
both
fancy
it
could
we
have
isn
t
there
some
sort
of
scientific
magic
that
makes
people
think
the
same
things
as
each
other
when
it
s
not
true
at
all
like
with
indian
mango
tricks
uncle
fred
said
so
you
know
they
call
it
i
ll
tell
something
said
francis
urgent
with
shoelace
if
we
keep
on
saying
things
weren
t
when
we
know
perfectly
well
they
were
we
shall
soon
dish
up
any
sort
of
chance
of
magic
we
may
ever
have
had
when
do
you
find
people
in
books
going
on
like
that
they
just
say
this
is
magic
and
behave
as
if
it
was
they
don
t
go
pretending
they
re
not
sure
why
no
magic
would
stand
aunt
dorothea
once
told
me
that
all
magic
was
like
prince
rupert
s
drop
mavis
owned
if
once
you
broke
it
there
was
nothing
left
but
a
little
that
s
just
what
i
m
saying
isn
t
it
we
ve
always
felt
there
was
magic
right
enough
haven
t
we
well
now
we
ve
come
across
it
don
t
let
s
be
silly
and
pretend
let
s
believe
in
it
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
we
eh
believing
in
things
makes
them
stronger
aunt
dorothea
said
that
they
stood
up
in
their
shoes
shall
we
tell
the
others
mavis
asked
we
must
said
francis
it
would
be
so
sneakish
not
to
but
they
won
t
believe
us
we
shall
have
to
be
like
cassandra
and
not
i
only
wish
i
knew
who
it
is
we
ve
got
to
save
said
mavis
francis
had
a
very
strong
and
perfect
feeling
that
they
would
know
this
all
in
good
time
he
could
not
have
explained
this
but
he
felt
it
all
he
said
was
let
s
and
they
ran
kathleen
and
bernard
met
them
at
the
gate
dancing
with
excitement
and
impatience
where
have
you
been
they
cried
and
what
on
earth
and
why
you
re
all
wet
down
to
the
up
i
know
i
their
elder
brother
came
in
and
passed
up
the
path
to
the
gate
you
might
have
called
us
said
kathleen
in
a
sort
of
voice
but
anyhow
you
ve
lost
something
by
going
out
so
early
without
lost
something
what
hearing
the
great
news
said
bernard
and
he
added
aha
what
news
wouldn
t
you
like
to
know
bernard
was
naturally
annoyed
at
having
been
left
out
of
the
first
expedition
of
the
holidays
anyone
would
have
even
you
or
i
out
with
it
said
francis
with
a
hand
on
bernard
s
ear
there
came
a
yell
from
bernard
and
mother
s
voice
from
the
window
saying
children
all
right
mummy
now
t
be
a
young
rotter
what
s
the
news
you
re
hurting
my
ear
was
all
bernard
s
rejoinder
all
right
said
francis
we
ve
got
some
news
too
but
we
won
t
tell
will
we
mavis
oh
said
kathleen
don
t
let
s
be
sneaky
the
very
first
day
too
it
s
only
that
they
ve
caught
the
mermaid
and
i
m
afraid
she
ll
die
in
captivity
like
you
said
what
s
yours
francis
had
released
bernard
s
ear
and
now
he
turned
to
mavis
so
that
s
it
he
said
who
s
got
her
the
circus
people
what
s
your
news
asked
kathleen
eagerly
after
brek
said
francis
yes
mother
half
a
sec
i
apologize
about
the
ear
bernard
we
will
tell
you
all
oh
it
s
quite
different
from
what
you
think
we
meet
and
discuss
the
situation
in
the
mill
the
minute
we
re
free
from
brek
agreed
right
yes
mother
coming
then
there
must
mavis
whispered
to
francis
be
two
mermaids
they
can
t
both
be
sabrina
then
which
we
ve
got
to
save
one
of
them
anyhow
francis
answered
with
the
light
of
big
adventure
in
his
eye
die
in
chapter
three
the
great
question
of
course
mother
take
them
to
the
circus
or
would
she
if
she
wouldn
t
herself
take
them
let
them
go
alone
she
had
once
in
buckinghamshire
allowed
them
to
go
to
a
traveling
menagerie
after
exacting
from
them
a
promise
that
they
were
not
to
touch
any
of
the
animals
and
they
had
seen
reason
to
regret
their
promise
when
the
showman
offered
to
let
them
stroke
his
tame
performing
wolf
who
was
so
very
like
a
collie
when
they
had
said
no
thank
you
the
showman
had
said
oh
frightened
are
you
run
along
home
to
mammy
then
and
the
bystanders
had
laughed
in
a
most
insulting
way
at
a
circus
of
course
the
horses
and
things
aren
t
near
enough
for
you
to
stroke
them
so
this
time
they
might
not
be
asked
to
promise
if
mother
came
with
them
her
presence
though
agreeable
would
certainly
add
to
the
difficulties
already
quite
even
mavis
could
not
but
rescuing
the
mermaid
but
suppose
mother
didn
t
come
with
them
suppose
we
have
to
promise
we
won
t
touch
any
of
the
animals
suggested
cathay
you
can
t
rescue
a
person
without
touching
that
s
just
it
said
mavis
a
mermaid
isn
t
an
animal
she
s
a
but
suppose
it
isn
t
that
sort
of
mermaid
said
bernard
suppose
it
s
the
sort
that
other
people
call
seals
like
it
said
in
the
well
it
isn
t
said
francis
briefly
adding
so
there
they
were
talking
in
the
front
garden
leaning
over
the
green
gate
while
mother
upstairs
unpacked
the
luggage
that
had
been
the
mound
with
spades
on
top
only
yesterday
at
waterloo
mavis
mother
called
through
the
open
window
i
can
only
you
d
better
come
i
ought
to
offer
to
help
mother
unpack
said
mavis
and
went
walking
slowly
she
came
back
after
a
little
while
however
quickly
running
it
s
all
right
she
said
mother
s
going
to
meet
daddy
at
the
junction
this
afternoon
and
buy
us
sunbonnets
and
we
re
to
take
our
spades
and
go
down
to
the
sea
till
s
roast
rabbit
and
apple
asked
we
can
go
to
the
circus
by
she
never
said
a
word
about
promise
not
to
touch
the
so
off
they
went
down
the
white
road
where
the
yellowhammer
was
talking
about
himself
as
usual
on
the
tree
just
beyond
wherever
you
happened
to
be
walking
and
so
to
the
beach
now
it
is
very
difficult
to
care
much
about
a
mermaid
you
have
never
seen
or
heard
or
touched
on
the
other
hand
when
once
you
have
seen
one
and
touched
one
and
heard
one
speak
you
seem
to
care
for
very
little
else
this
was
why
when
they
got
to
the
shore
kathleen
and
bernard
began
at
once
to
dig
the
moat
of
a
sandcastle
while
the
elder
ones
walked
up
and
down
dragging
the
new
spades
after
them
like
some
new
kind
of
tail
and
talking
talking
talking
till
kathleen
said
they
might
help
dig
or
the
tide
would
be
in
before
the
castle
was
done
you
don
t
know
what
a
lark
sandcastles
are
france
she
added
kindly
because
you
ve
never
seen
the
sea
so
then
they
all
dug
and
piled
and
patted
and
made
molds
of
their
pails
to
stand
as
towers
to
the
castle
and
dug
out
dungeons
and
tunnels
and
bridges
only
the
roof
always
gave
way
in
the
end
unless
you
had
beaten
the
sand
very
tight
beforehand
it
was
a
glorious
castle
though
not
quite
finished
when
the
first
thin
flat
wash
of
the
sea
reached
it
and
then
everyone
worked
twice
as
hard
trying
to
keep
the
sea
out
till
all
was
hopeless
and
then
everyone
crowded
into
the
castle
and
the
sea
washed
it
away
bit
by
bit
till
there
was
only
a
shapeless
island
left
and
everyone
was
wet
through
and
had
to
change
every
single
thing
the
minute
they
got
home
you
will
know
by
that
how
much
they
enjoyed
themselves
after
the
roast
rabbit
and
the
apple
dumplings
mother
started
on
the
expedition
francis
went
with
her
to
the
station
and
returned
a
little
sad
i
had
to
promise
not
to
touch
any
of
the
animals
he
said
and
perhaps
a
mermaid
an
not
if
she
can
speak
said
kathleen
i
say
don
t
you
think
we
ought
to
wear
our
best
do
it
s
more
respectable
to
the
wonders
of
the
deep
she
d
like
us
to
look
i
m
not
going
to
change
for
anybody
said
bernard
firmly
all
right
bear
said
mavis
only
we
will
remember
it
s
i
say
france
he
said
do
you
think
we
to
change
no
i
don
t
francis
answered
i
don
t
believe
mermaids
care
a
bit
what
you
ve
got
on
you
see
they
don
t
wear
anything
but
tails
and
hair
and
looking
glasses
themselves
if
there
s
any
beautifulness
to
be
done
they
jolly
well
do
it
themselves
but
i
don
t
say
you
wouldn
t
be
better
for
washing
your
hands
again
and
you
might
as
well
try
to
get
of
the
sand
out
of
your
hair
it
looks
like
the
wrong
end
of
a
broom
as
it
he
himself
went
so
far
as
to
put
on
the
blue
necktie
that
aunt
amy
had
given
him
and
polished
his
silver
watch
chain
on
the
inside
of
his
jacket
this
helped
to
pass
the
time
till
the
girls
were
ready
at
last
this
happened
though
they
had
put
on
their
best
things
and
they
started
the
yellowhammer
went
on
about
was
never
tired
of
the
subject
it
s
just
as
if
that
bird
was
making
fun
of
us
bernard
said
i
daresay
it
is
a
step
we
re
taking
said
kathleen
but
the
circus
will
be
jolly
there
is
a
piece
of
wasteland
just
beyond
beachfield
on
the
least
agreeable
side
of
that
side
where
the
shops
are
and
the
yellow
brick
houses
at
the
nice
end
of
beachfield
the
shops
have
little
fat
bow
windows
with
greenish
glass
that
you
can
hardly
see
through
here
also
are
gaunt
hoardings
plastered
with
tattered
posters
asking
you
in
red
to
wear
ramsden
s
really
boots
or
to
vote
for
wilton
ashby
in
blue
some
of
the
corners
of
the
posters
are
always
loose
and
flap
dismally
in
the
wind
there
is
always
a
good
deal
of
straw
and
torn
paper
and
dust
at
this
end
of
the
village
and
bits
of
dirty
rag
and
old
boots
and
tins
are
found
under
the
hedges
where
flowers
ought
to
be
also
there
are
a
great
many
nettles
and
barbed
wires
instead
of
fences
don
t
you
sometimes
wonder
who
is
to
blame
for
all
the
uglification
of
places
that
might
be
so
pretty
and
wish
you
could
have
a
word
with
them
and
ask
them
not
to
perhaps
when
these
people
were
little
nobody
told
them
how
wrong
it
is
to
throw
orange
peel
about
and
the
bits
of
paper
off
chocolate
and
the
paper
bag
which
once
concealed
your
bun
and
it
is
a
dreadful
fact
that
the
children
who
throw
these
things
about
are
little
uglifiers
and
they
grow
up
to
be
perfect
monsters
of
uglification
and
build
hideous
yellow
brick
cottages
and
put
up
hoardings
and
sell
ramsden
s
really
boots
in
red
and
vote
passionately
for
wilton
ashby
in
blue
and
care
nothing
for
the
fields
that
used
to
be
green
and
the
hedges
where
once
flowers
used
to
grow
some
people
like
this
and
see
nothing
to
hate
in
such
ugly
waste
places
as
the
one
at
the
wrong
end
of
the
town
where
the
fair
was
being
held
on
that
day
when
francis
mavis
bernard
and
kathleen
set
out
in
their
best
clothes
to
rescue
the
mermaid
because
mermaids
die
in
the
fair
had
none
of
those
stalls
and
booths
which
fairs
used
to
have
where
they
sold
toys
and
gilt
gingerbread
and
carters
whips
and
cups
and
saucers
and
mutton
pies
and
dolls
and
china
dogs
and
shell
boxes
and
pincushions
and
needle
cases
and
penholders
with
views
of
the
isle
of
wight
and
winchester
cathedral
inside
that
you
see
so
bright
and
plain
when
you
put
your
eye
close
to
the
little
round
hole
at
the
top
the
steam
roundabouts
were
hardly
a
lean
back
of
their
spotted
horses
was
covered
by
a
rider
there
were
swings
but
no
one
happened
to
be
swinging
there
were
no
shows
no
menagerie
no
boxing
booth
no
marionettes
no
penny
gaff
with
the
spangled
lady
and
the
fat
man
who
beats
the
drum
nor
were
there
any
stalls
there
were
paper
whips
and
bags
of
minced
english
substitute
for
were
little
metal
tubes
of
dirty
water
to
squirt
in
people
s
faces
but
except
for
the
sale
of
these
crude
instruments
for
making
other
people
uncomfortable
there
was
not
a
stall
in
the
fair
i
give
you
my
word
there
was
not
a
single
thing
that
you
could
gingerbread
no
sweets
no
crockery
dogs
not
even
a
orange
or
a
bag
of
nuts
nor
was
there
anything
to
as
much
as
a
lemonade
counter
or
a
ginger
beer
stall
the
revelers
were
no
doubt
drinking
elsewhere
a
tomblike
silence
silence
which
all
the
steam
roundabout
s
hideous
hootings
only
emphasized
a
very
boy
overhearing
a
hurried
council
volunteered
the
information
that
the
circus
had
not
yet
opened
never
mind
they
told
each
turned
to
the
sideshows
these
were
all
of
one
arrangement
by
which
you
throw
something
or
roll
something
at
something
else
and
if
you
hit
the
something
you
get
a
sort
of
prize
that
is
sold
in
houndsditch
at
ninepence
a
gross
most
of
these
arrangements
are
so
ordered
that
to
get
a
prize
is
impossible
for
instance
a
peculiarly
offensive
row
of
masks
with
open
mouths
in
which
pipes
are
set
up
in
the
golden
days
of
long
ago
if
you
hit
a
pipe
it
you
got
a
prize
can
t
do
it
briefly
at
the
hundred
and
part
of
ninepence
but
the
children
found
that
when
their
wooden
ball
struck
the
pipe
it
didn
t
break
they
wondered
why
then
looking
more
closely
they
saw
that
the
pipes
were
not
of
clay
but
of
painted
wood
they
could
never
be
the
whole
thing
was
a
cruel
mockery
of
hope
the
was
not
what
it
used
to
be
either
once
one
threw
sticks
three
shies
a
penny
now
it
is
a
penny
a
shy
with
light
wooden
balls
you
can
win
a
coconut
if
you
happen
to
hit
one
that
is
not
glued
onto
its
support
if
you
really
wish
to
win
one
of
these
unkindly
fruits
it
is
well
to
stand
and
watch
a
little
and
not
to
aim
at
those
coconuts
which
when
they
are
hit
fail
to
fall
off
the
sticks
are
they
glued
on
one
hopes
not
but
if
they
are
who
can
wonder
or
reprove
it
is
hard
to
get
a
living
anyhow
there
was
one
thing
though
that
roused
the
children
s
i
think
because
its
owners
were
clean
and
did
not
look
so
there
was
no
barrier
of
pity
between
them
and
sort
of
round
table
sloping
up
to
its
center
on
this
small
objects
were
arranged
for
a
penny
you
received
two
hoops
if
you
could
throw
a
hoop
over
an
object
that
object
was
yours
none
of
the
rustic
visitors
to
the
fair
could
it
seemed
or
cared
to
it
did
not
look
difficult
however
nor
was
it
at
the
first
shot
a
tiny
candlestick
was
encircled
between
pride
and
shame
mavis
held
out
a
hand
hard
luck
said
one
of
the
two
young
women
too
clean
to
be
pitied
has
to
go
flat
francis
tried
again
this
time
the
ring
encircled
a
matchbox
flat
hard
luck
said
the
lady
again
what
s
the
matter
now
the
children
asked
baffled
hoop
has
to
be
red
side
up
said
she
so
she
scored
now
they
went
to
the
other
side
and
had
another
penn
orth
of
hoops
from
the
other
too
clean
young
woman
and
the
same
thing
happened
only
on
the
second
winning
she
said
hard
luck
hoops
have
to
be
blue
side
it
was
bernard
s
blood
that
was
up
he
determined
to
clear
the
board
blue
side
up
is
it
he
said
sternly
and
took
another
penn
orth
this
time
he
brought
down
a
tin
pin
tray
and
a
little
box
which
i
hope
contained
something
the
girl
hesitated
and
then
handed
over
the
prizes
another
penn
orth
of
hoops
said
bernard
warming
to
the
work
hard
luck
said
she
we
don
t
give
more
than
two
penn
orth
to
any
one
the
prizes
were
not
the
kind
of
things
you
care
to
keep
even
as
trophies
of
when
you
have
before
you
the
business
of
rescuing
a
mermaid
the
children
gave
their
prizes
to
a
small
female
bystander
and
went
to
the
shooting
gallery
that
at
least
could
have
no
nonsense
about
it
if
you
aimed
at
a
bottle
and
hit
it
it
would
break
no
sordid
custodian
could
rob
you
of
the
pleasant
tinkling
of
the
broken
bottle
and
even
with
a
poor
weapon
it
is
not
impossible
to
aim
at
a
bottle
and
hit
it
this
is
at
the
shooting
gallery
the
trouble
was
to
hit
the
bottles
there
were
so
many
of
them
and
they
were
so
near
the
children
got
thirteen
tinkling
smashes
for
their
fourteen
shots
the
bottles
were
hung
fifteen
feet
away
instead
of
thirty
why
space
is
not
valuable
at
the
it
be
that
the
people
of
sussex
are
such
poor
shots
that
thirty
feet
is
to
them
a
prohibitive
distance
they
did
not
throw
for
coconuts
nor
did
they
ride
on
the
little
horses
or
pull
themselves
to
dizzy
heights
in
the
swings
there
was
no
heart
left
in
them
for
such
besides
everyone
in
the
fair
saving
themselves
and
the
small
female
bystander
and
the
hoop
girls
was
dirtier
than
you
would
believe
possible
i
suppose
beachfield
has
a
water
supply
but
you
would
have
doubted
it
if
you
had
been
at
the
fair
they
heard
no
laughter
no
gay
talk
no
hearty
of
holiday
jests
a
dull
heavy
silence
brooded
over
the
place
and
you
could
hear
that
silence
under
the
shallow
insincere
gaiety
of
the
steam
roundabout
laughter
and
song
music
and
dancing
and
innocent
revelry
there
were
none
of
these
at
beachfield
fair
for
music
there
was
the
steam
roundabout
s
echoes
of
the
sordid
musical
comedy
of
the
year
before
the
year
before
there
was
the
dirty
guardians
of
the
machines
for
getting
your
pennies
stood
gloomily
huddled
and
a
few
groups
of
dejected
girls
and
little
boys
shivered
in
the
cold
wind
that
had
come
up
with
the
sunset
in
that
wind
too
danced
the
dust
the
straw
the
newspaper
and
the
chocolate
wrappers
the
only
dancing
there
was
the
big
tent
that
held
the
circus
was
at
the
top
of
the
ground
and
the
people
who
were
busy
among
the
ropes
and
pegs
and
between
the
bright
vans
resting
on
their
shafts
seemed
gayer
and
cleaner
than
the
people
who
kept
the
little
arrangements
for
people
not
to
win
prizes
at
and
now
the
circus
at
last
was
opened
the
flap
of
the
tent
was
pinned
back
and
a
woman
with
oily
black
ringlets
and
eyes
like
bright
black
beads
came
out
at
the
side
to
take
the
money
of
those
who
wished
to
see
the
circus
people
were
now
strolling
toward
it
in
twos
and
threes
and
of
these
our
four
were
the
very
first
and
the
gypsy
woman
took
four
warm
sixpences
from
their
four
hands
walk
in
walk
in
my
little
dears
and
see
the
white
elephant
said
a
stout
man
in
evening
it
was
and
shiny
about
the
seams
he
flourished
a
long
whip
as
he
spoke
and
the
children
stopped
although
they
had
paid
their
sixpences
to
hear
what
they
were
to
see
when
they
did
walk
in
the
white
trunk
and
tusks
all
complete
sixpence
only
see
the
back
try
a
or
camels
or
ships
of
the
drinker
when
he
gets
the
abstainer
while
crossing
the
desert

up

the
trained
wolves
and
wolverines
in
their
great
national
dance
with
the
flags
of
all
countries

up
walk
up
walk
up
see
the
educated
seals
and
the
unique
lotus
of
the
heast
in
her
famous
act

three
horses
at
once
the
wonder
and
envy
of
royalty
walk
up
and
see
the
very
table
mermaid
caught
on
your
own
coast
only
yesterday
as
ever
thank
you
said
francis
i
think
we
and
the
four
went
through
the
opened
canvas
into
the
pleasant
yellow
dusty
twilight
which
was
the
inside
of
a
squarish
sort
of
tent
with
an
opening
at
the
end
and
through
that
opening
you
could
see
the
ring
of
the
circus
and
benches
all
around
it
and
two
men
just
finishing
covering
the
front
benches
with
red
cotton
strips
where
s
the
mermaid
mavis
asked
a
little
boy
in
tights
and
a
spangled
cap
in
there
he
said
pointing
to
a
little
canvas
door
at
the
side
of
the
squarish
tent
i
don
t
advise
you
to
touch
her
though
spiteful
she
is
lashes
out
with
her
old
mother
lee
all
over
water
she
dangerous
too
our
bill
e
got
is
bone
set
out
in
his
wrist
to
hold
on
to
her
an
it
s
thruppence
extry
to
see
her
there
are
times
as
we
all
know
when
threepence
extra
is
a
baffling
cruel
barrier
to
desire
but
this
was
not
fortunately
such
a
moment
the
children
had
plenty
of
money
because
mother
had
given
them
two
between
them
to
spend
as
they
liked
even
then
said
bernard
in
allusion
to
the
threepence
extra
we
shall
have
two
bob
so
mavis
who
was
treasurer
paid
over
the
extra
threepences
to
a
girl
with
hair
as
fair
and
lank
as
hemp
and
a
face
as
brown
and
round
as
a
tea
cake
who
sat
on
a
kitchen
chair
by
the
mermaid
door
then
one
by
one
they
went
in
through
the
narrow
opening
and
at
last
there
they
were
alone
in
the
little
canvas
room
with
a
tank
in
it
that
there
was
a
large
label
evidently
written
in
a
hurry
for
the
letters
were
badly
made
and
arranged
quite
crookedly
and
this
label
declared
real
live
mermaid
said
to
be
fabulus
but
now
true
caught
here
please
do
not
touch
dangerous
the
little
spangled
boy
had
followed
them
in
and
pointed
to
the
last
word
what
i
tell
you
he
asked
proudly
the
children
looked
at
each
other
nothing
could
be
done
with
this
witness
at
hand
at
least
perhaps
if
it
s
going
to
be
magic
mavis
whispered
to
francis
outsiders
wouldn
t
notice
they
don
t
believe
suppose
you
just
said
a
bit
of
sabrina
to
start
the
wouldn
t
be
safe
francis
returned
in
the
same
low
tones
suppose
he
an
outsider
and
so
there
they
stood
helpless
what
the
label
was
hung
on
was
a
large
zinc
kind
that
they
have
at
the
tops
of
houses
for
the
water
must
have
seen
one
yourself
often
when
the
pipes
burst
in
frosty
weather
and
your
father
goes
up
into
the
roof
of
the
house
with
a
candle
and
pail
and
the
water
drips
through
the
ceilings
and
the
plumber
is
sent
for
and
comes
when
it
suits
him
the
tank
was
full
of
water
and
at
the
bottom
of
it
could
be
seen
a
mass
of
something
dark
that
looked
as
if
it
were
partly
fish
and
partly
seaweed
sabrina
fair
francis
suddenly
whispered
send
him
and
immediately
a
voice
from
outside
called
the
boy
where
s
he
got
to
the
little
spangled
intruder
had
to
go
there
now
said
mavis
if
isn
t
magic
perhaps
it
was
but
still
the
dark
heap
in
the
tank
had
not
stirred
say
it
all
through
said
mavis
yes
do
said
bernard
then
we
shall
know
for
certain
whether
it
s
a
seal
or
so
once
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
the
glassie
cool
translucent
wave
he
got
no
further
there
was
a
heaving
and
stirring
of
the
seaweed
and
fish
tail
something
gleamed
white
through
the
brown
something
white
parted
the
seaweed
two
white
hands
parted
it
and
a
face
came
to
the
surface
of
the
rather
dirty
water
was
no
doubt
about
translucent
wave
indeed
was
what
the
face
said
i
wonder
you
re
not
ashamed
to
speak
the
invocation
over
a
miserable
cistern
like
this
what
do
you
want
brown
hair
and
seaweed
still
veiled
most
of
the
face
but
all
the
children
who
after
their
first
start
back
had
pressed
close
to
the
tank
again
could
see
that
the
face
looked
exceedingly
cross
we
want
said
francis
in
a
voice
that
would
tremble
though
he
told
himself
again
and
again
that
he
was
not
a
baby
and
wasn
t
going
to
behave
like
we
want
to
help
help
you
she
raised
herself
a
little
more
in
the
tank
and
looked
contemptuously
at
them
why
don
t
you
know
that
i
am
mistress
of
all
water
magic
i
can
raise
a
storm
that
will
sweep
away
this
horrible
place
and
my
detestable
captors
and
you
with
them
and
carry
me
on
the
back
of
a
great
wave
down
to
the
depths
of
the
then
why
on
earth
don
t
you
bernard
asked
well
i
was
thinking
about
it
she
said
a
little
awkwardly
when
you
interrupted
with
your
spells
well
you
ve
called
and
i
ve
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
we
ve
told
you
said
mavis
gently
enough
though
she
was
frightfully
disappointed
that
the
mermaid
after
having
in
the
handsomest
manner
turned
out
to
be
a
mermaid
should
be
such
a
very
one
and
when
they
had
talked
about
her
all
day
and
paid
the
threepence
each
extra
to
see
her
close
and
put
on
their
best
white
dresses
too
we
ve
told
want
to
help
you
another
sabrina
in
the
sea
told
us
to
didn
t
tell
us
anything
about
you
being
a
she
just
said
they
die
in
illustration
translucent
wave
indeed
well
thank
you
for
coming
said
the
mermaid
if
she
really
said
that
it
must
be
one
of
two
the
sun
is
in
the
house
of
is
impossible
at
this
time
of
the
else
the
rope
i
was
caught
with
must
be
made
of
llama
s
hair
and
impossible
in
these
latitudes
do
you
know
anything
about
the
rope
they
caught
me
with
no
said
bernard
and
kathleen
but
the
others
said
it
was
a
ah
said
the
mermaid
my
worst
fears
are
who
could
have
expected
a
lariat
on
these
shores
but
that
must
have
been
it
now
i
know
why
though
i
have
been
on
the
point
of
working
the
magic
of
the
great
storm
at
least
five
hundred
times
since
my
capture
some
unseen
influence
has
always
held
me
you
mean
said
bernard
you
feel
that
it
wouldn
t
work
so
you
didn
t
a
rattling
ripping
sound
outside
beginning
softly
waxed
louder
and
louder
so
as
almost
to
drown
their
voices
it
was
the
drum
and
it
announced
the
beginning
of
the
circus
the
spangled
child
put
his
head
in
and
said
hurry
up
or
you
ll
miss
my
infant
prodigious
act
on
the
horse
with
the
tambourines
and
took
his
head
out
again
oh
dear
said
mavis
and
we
haven
t
arranged
a
single
thing
about
rescuing
no
more
you
have
said
the
mermaid
carelessly
look
here
said
francis
you
do
to
be
rescued
don
t
you
of
course
i
do
replied
the
mermaid
impatiently
now
i
know
about
the
llama
rope
but
i
can
t
walk
even
if
they
d
let
me
and
you
couldn
t
carry
me
couldn
t
you
come
at
dead
of
night
with
a
could
lift
myself
into
it
with
your
you
could
drive
swiftly
hence
and
driving
into
the
sea
i
could
drop
from
the
chariot
and
escape
while
you
swam
i
don
t
believe
we
of
it
said
bernard
let
alone
swimming
ashore
with
horses
and
chariots
why
pharaoh
himself
couldn
t
do
that
you
and
even
mavis
and
francis
added
helplessly
i
don
t
see
how
we
re
to
get
a
chariot
and
do
you
think
of
some
other
i
shall
await
you
said
the
lady
in
the
tank
with
perfect
calmness
at
dead
of
with
that
she
twisted
the
seaweed
closely
around
her
head
and
shoulders
and
sank
slowly
to
the
bottom
of
the
tank
and
the
children
were
left
staring
blankly
at
each
other
while
in
the
circus
tent
music
sounded
and
the
soft
heavy
of
hoofs
on
sawdust
what
shall
we
do
francis
broke
the
silence
go
and
see
the
circus
of
course
said
bernard
of
course
we
can
talk
about
the
chariot
afterward
mavis
admitted
there
ll
be
lots
of
time
to
talk
between
now
and
dead
of
night
said
kathleen
come
on
and
they
went
there
is
nothing
like
a
circus
for
making
you
forget
your
anxieties
it
is
impossible
to
dwell
on
your
troubles
and
difficulties
when
performing
dogs
are
displaying
their
accomplishments
and
wolves
dancing
their
celebrated
dance
with
the
flags
of
all
nations
and
the
engaging
lady
who
jumps
through
the
paper
hoops
and
comes
down
miraculously
on
the
flat
back
of
the
white
horse
can
not
but
drive
dull
care
away
especially
from
the
minds
of
the
young
so
that
for
an
hour
and
a
really
was
a
good
circus
and
i
can
t
think
how
it
happened
to
be
at
beachfield
fair
at
solid
slab
of
breathless
enjoyment
was
wedged
in
between
the
interview
with
the
mermaid
and
the
difficult
task
of
procuring
for
her
the
chariot
she
wanted
but
when
it
was
all
over
and
they
were
part
of
a
hot
tightly
packed
crowd
pouring
out
of
the
dusty
tent
into
the
sunshine
their
responsibilities
came
upon
them
with
renewed
force
wasn
t
the
clown
ripping
said
bernard
as
they
got
free
of
the
crowd
i
liked
the
lady
best
and
the
horse
that
went
like
that
best
said
kathleen
trying
with
small
pale
hands
and
brown
shod
legs
to
give
an
example
of
a
horse
s
conduct
during
an
exhibition
of
the
didn
t
you
think
the
mavis
was
beginning
when
francis
interrupted
her
about
that
chariot
he
said
and
after
that
they
talked
of
nothing
else
and
whatever
they
said
it
always
came
to
this
in
the
end
that
they
hadn
t
got
a
chariot
and
couldn
t
get
a
chariot
and
that
anyhow
they
didn
t
suppose
there
was
a
chariot
to
be
got
at
any
rate
in
beachfield
it
wouldn
t
be
any
good
i
suppose
said
kathleen
s
last
and
most
helpful
be
the
slightest
good
saying
sabrina
fair
to
a
pumpkin
we
haven
t
got
even
a
pumpkin
bernard
reminded
her
let
alone
the
rats
and
mice
and
lizards
that
cinderella
had
no
that
s
no
good
but
i
ll
tell
you
he
stopped
short
they
were
near
home
was
late
afternoon
in
the
road
where
the
talkative
yellowhammer
lived
what
about
a
wheelbarrow
not
big
enough
said
francis
there
s
an
extra
big
one
in
the
mill
said
bernard
now
look
here
i
m
not
any
good
at
magic
but
uncle
tom
said
i
was
a
born
general
if
i
tell
you
exactly
what
to
do
will
you
two
do
it
and
let
cathay
and
me
off
going
going
to
sneak
out
of
it
francis
asked
bitterly
it
isn
t
it
s
not
my
game
at
all
and
i
don
t
want
to
play
and
if
i
do
the
whole
thing
will
be
know
it
will
i
m
so
unlucky
you
d
never
get
out
at
dead
of
night
without
me
dropping
a
boot
on
the
stairs
or
know
you
wouldn
bernard
took
a
sort
of
melancholy
pride
in
being
the
kind
of
boy
who
always
gets
caught
if
you
are
that
sort
of
boy
perhaps
that
s
the
best
way
to
take
it
and
francis
could
not
deny
that
there
was
something
in
what
he
said
he
went
on
then
kathleen
s
my
special
sister
and
i
m
not
going
to
have
her
dragged
into
a
row
i
want
to
kathleen
put
in
ungratefully
so
will
you
and
mavis
do
it
on
your
own
or
not
after
some
discussion
in
which
kathleen
was
tactfully
dealt
with
it
was
agreed
that
they
would
then
bernard
unfolded
his
plan
of
campaign
directly
we
get
home
he
said
we
ll
begin
larking
about
with
that
old
each
other
rides
and
so
on
and
when
it
s
time
to
go
in
we
ll
leave
it
at
the
far
end
of
the
field
behind
the
old
sheep
hut
near
the
gate
then
it
ll
be
handy
for
you
at
dead
of
night
you
must
take
towels
or
something
and
tie
around
the
wheel
so
that
it
doesn
t
make
a
row
you
can
sleep
with
my
toy
alarm
under
your
pillow
and
it
won
t
wake
anyone
but
you
you
get
out
through
the
dining
room
window
and
in
the
same
way
i
ll
lend
you
my
new
knife
with
three
blades
and
a
corkscrew
if
you
ll
take
care
of
it
to
cut
the
canvas
and
go
by
the
back
lane
that
comes
out
behind
where
the
circus
is
but
if
you
took
my
advice
you
wouldn
t
go
at
all
she
s
not
a
nice
mermaid
at
all
i
d
rather
have
had
a
seal
any
day
hullo
there
s
daddy
and
mother
come
they
came
on
the
program
sketched
by
bernard
was
carried
out
without
a
hitch
everything
went
well
only
francis
and
mavis
were
both
astonished
to
find
themselves
much
more
frightened
than
they
had
expected
to
be
any
really
great
adventure
like
the
rescuing
of
a
mermaid
does
always
look
so
very
much
more
serious
when
you
carry
it
out
at
night
than
it
did
when
you
were
planning
it
in
the
daytime
also
though
they
knew
they
were
not
doing
anything
wrong
they
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
that
mother
and
daddy
might
not
agree
with
them
on
that
point
and
of
course
they
could
not
ask
leave
to
go
and
rescue
a
mermaid
with
a
chariot
at
dead
of
night
it
is
not
the
sort
of
thing
you
can
ask
leave
to
do
somehow
and
the
more
you
explained
your
reasons
the
less
people
would
think
you
fit
to
conduct
such
an
expedition
francis
lay
down
fully
dressed
under
his
nightshirt
and
mavis
under
hers
wore
her
short
blue
skirt
and
jersey
the
alarm
true
to
its
trust
went
off
into
an
whizz
and
bang
under
the
pillow
of
francis
but
no
one
else
heard
it
he
crept
cautiously
into
mavis
s
room
and
wakened
her
and
as
they
crept
down
in
stockinged
feet
not
a
board
creaked
the
french
window
opened
without
noise
the
wheelbarrow
was
where
they
had
left
it
and
they
had
fortunately
brought
quite
enough
string
to
bind
wads
of
towels
and
stockings
to
the
tire
of
its
wheel
also
they
had
not
forgotten
the
knife
the
wheelbarrow
was
heavy
and
they
rather
shrank
from
imagining
how
much
heavier
it
would
be
when
the
discontented
mermaid
was
curled
up
in
it
however
they
took
it
in
turns
and
got
along
all
right
by
the
back
lane
that
comes
out
above
the
waste
ground
where
beachfield
holds
its
fairs
i
hope
the
night
s
dead
enough
mavis
whispered
as
the
circus
came
in
sight
looking
very
white
in
the
starlight
it
s
nearly
two
by
now
i
should
quite
dead
enough
if
that
s
all
said
francis
but
suppose
the
gypsies
are
awake
they
do
sit
up
to
study
astronomy
to
tell
fortunes
with
don
t
they
suppose
this
is
their
astronomy
night
i
vote
we
leave
the
barrow
here
and
go
and
they
did
their
sandshoes
made
no
noise
on
the
dewy
grass
and
treading
very
carefully
on
tiptoe
they
came
to
the
tent
francis
nearly
tumbled
over
a
guy
rope
he
just
saw
it
in
time
to
avoid
it
if
i
d
been
bernard
i
should
have
come
a
beastly
noisy
cropper
over
that
he
told
himself
they
crept
around
the
tent
till
they
came
to
the
little
square
bulge
that
marked
the
place
where
the
tank
was
and
the
seaweed
and
the
mermaid
they
die
in
captivity
they
die
in
captivity
they
die
in
captivity
mavis
kept
repeating
to
herself
trying
to
keep
up
her
courage
by
reminding
herself
of
the
desperately
urgent
nature
of
the
adventure
it
s
a
matter
of
life
and
death
she
told
life
and
and
now
they
picked
their
way
between
the
pegs
and
guy
ropes
and
came
quite
close
to
the
canvas
doubts
of
the
strength
and
silence
of
the
knife
possessed
the
trembling
soul
of
francis
mavis
s
heart
was
beating
so
thickly
that
as
she
said
afterward
she
could
hardly
hear
herself
think
she
scratched
gently
on
the
canvas
while
francis
felt
for
the
knife
with
the
three
blades
and
the
corkscrew
an
answering
signal
from
the
imprisoned
mermaid
would
she
felt
give
her
fresh
confidence
there
was
no
answering
scratch
instead
a
dark
line
appeared
to
run
up
the
was
an
opening
made
by
the
two
hands
of
the
mermaid
which
held
back
the
two
halves
of
the
tent
side
cut
neatly
from
top
to
bottom
her
white
face
peered
out
where
is
the
chariot
she
asked
in
the
softest
of
whispers
but
not
too
soft
to
carry
to
the
children
the
feeling
that
she
was
if
possible
crosser
than
ever
francis
was
afraid
to
answer
he
knew
that
his
voice
could
never
be
subdued
to
anything
as
soft
as
the
voice
that
questioned
him
a
voice
like
the
sound
of
tiny
waves
on
a
summer
night
like
the
whisper
of
wheat
when
the
wind
passes
through
it
on
a
summer
morning
but
he
pointed
toward
the
lane
where
they
had
left
the
wheelbarrow
and
he
and
mavis
crept
away
to
fetch
it
as
they
wheeled
it
down
the
waste
place
both
felt
how
much
they
owed
to
bernard
but
for
his
idea
of
muffling
the
wheel
they
could
never
have
got
the
clumsy
great
thing
down
that
bumpy
uneven
slope
but
as
it
was
they
and
the
barrow
stole
toward
the
gypsy
s
tent
as
silently
as
the
arabs
in
the
poem
stole
away
with
theirs
and
they
wheeled
it
close
to
the
riven
tent
side
then
mavis
scratched
again
and
again
the
tent
opened
have
you
any
cords
the
soft
voice
whispered
and
francis
pulled
what
was
left
of
the
string
from
his
pocket
she
had
made
two
holes
in
the
tent
side
and
now
passing
the
string
through
these
she
tied
back
the
flaps
of
the
tent
now
she
said
raising
herself
in
the
tank
and
resting
her
hands
on
its
side
you
must
both
hold
of
my
tail
and
lift
creep
on
each
it
was
a
wet
sloppy
slippery
heavy
business
and
mavis
thought
her
arms
would
break
but
she
kept
saying
die
in
captivity
and
just
as
she
was
feeling
that
she
could
not
bear
it
another
minute
the
strain
slackened
and
there
was
the
mermaid
curled
up
in
the
barrow
now
said
the
soft
voice
it
was
all
very
well
to
say
go
quickly
it
was
as
much
as
the
two
children
could
do
with
that
of
dripping
mermaid
to
go
at
all
and
very
very
slowly
they
crept
up
the
waste
space
in
the
lane
under
cover
of
the
tall
hedges
they
paused
go
on
said
the
mermaid
we
can
t
till
we
ve
rested
a
bit
said
mavis
panting
how
did
you
manage
to
get
that
canvas
cut
my
shell
knife
of
course
said
the
person
in
the
wheelbarrow
we
always
carry
one
in
our
hair
in
case
of
i
see
said
francis
breathing
heavily
you
had
much
better
go
on
said
the
barrow
s
occupant
this
chariot
is
excessively
uncomfortable
and
much
too
small
besides
delays
are
we
ll
go
in
half
a
sec
said
francis
and
mavis
added
kindly
you
re
really
quite
safe
now
you
aren
t
said
the
mermaid
i
don
t
know
whether
you
realize
that
i
m
stolen
property
and
that
it
will
be
extremely
awkward
for
you
if
you
are
caught
with
but
we
shan
t
be
caught
with
you
said
mavis
hopefully
everybody
s
sound
asleep
said
francis
it
was
wonderful
how
brave
and
confident
they
felt
now
that
the
deed
was
done
it
s
perfectly
what
s
that
oh
a
hand
had
shot
from
the
black
shadow
of
the
hedge
and
caught
him
by
the
arm
what
is
it
france
what
is
it
said
mavis
who
could
not
see
what
was
happening
what
is
what
is
it
asked
the
mermaid
more
crossly
than
she
had
yet
spoken
is
it
oh
who
is
it
gasped
francis
writhing
in
the
grip
of
his
invisible
assailant
and
from
the
dark
shadow
of
the
hedge
came
the
simple
and
terrible
reply
the
police
chapter
four
it
is
hardly
possible
to
imagine
a
situation
less
attractive
than
that
of
mavis
and
the
position
of
the
mermaid
curled
up
in
a
dry
barrow
and
far
from
her
native
element
was
not
exactly
luxurious
still
she
was
no
worse
off
than
she
had
been
when
the
lariat
first
curled
itself
about
her
fishy
extremity
but
the
children
they
had
braved
the
terrors
of
night
in
an
adventure
of
singular
courage
and
daring
they
had
carried
out
their
desperate
enterprise
the
mermaid
was
rescued
and
success
seemed
further
off
than
the
sea
indeed
and
that
in
point
of
fact
was
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
away
to
be
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
achievement
and
then
to
have
the
cup
of
victory
dashed
from
your
lips
the
crown
of
victory
torn
from
your
brow
police
it
was
indeed
hard
and
what
was
more
it
was
dangerous
we
shall
pass
the
night
in
the
cells
thought
mavis
in
agony
and
whatever
will
mother
do
when
she
finds
we
re
gone
in
her
mind
the
cells
were
underground
dungeons
dark
and
damp
and
vaulted
where
toads
and
lizards
crawled
and
no
daylight
ever
penetrated
that
is
how
dungeons
are
described
in
books
about
the
inquisition
when
the
voice
from
the
bush
had
said
the
police
a
stricken
silence
followed
the
mouth
of
francis
felt
dry
inside
just
as
if
he
had
been
eating
cracknels
he
explained
afterward
and
he
had
to
swallow
nothing
before
he
could
say
what
for
let
go
his
arm
said
mavis
to
the
hidden
foe
we
won
t
run
away
really
we
won
you
can
t
said
the
mermaid
you
can
t
leave
leave
go
said
francis
wriggling
and
then
suddenly
mavis
made
a
dart
at
the
clutching
hand
and
caught
it
by
the
wrist
and
whispered
savagely
it
s
not
a
policeman
at
all
come
out
of
that
out
and
dragged
and
something
did
come
out
of
the
bush
something
that
certainly
was
not
a
policeman
it
was
small
and
thin
whereas
policemen
are
almost
always
tall
and
stout
it
did
not
wear
the
blue
coats
our
roberts
wear
but
velveteen
knickerbockers
and
a
tweed
jacket
it
was
in
fact
a
very
small
boy
francis
broke
into
a
cackle
of
relief
you
he
said
what
a
fright
you
gave
animal
yourself
if
you
come
to
that
let
alone
her
and
her
tail
the
boy
answered
and
mavis
thought
his
voice
didn
t
sound
unfriendly
my
but
i
did
take
a
rise
out
of
you
that
time
eh
ain
t
she
bit
you
yet
nor
yet
strook
you
with
that
there
of
hers
and
then
they
recognized
him
it
was
the
little
spangled
boy
only
now
of
course
being
off
duty
he
was
no
more
spangled
than
you
and
i
are
whatever
did
you
do
it
for
mavis
asked
crossly
it
was
horrid
of
it
wasn
t
only
just
a
lark
said
the
boy
i
cut
around
and
listened
this
afternoon
when
you
was
jawing
and
i
thought
why
not
be
in
it
only
i
do
sleep
that
heavy
what
with
the
riding
and
the
tumbling
and
all
so
i
didn
t
wake
till
you
d
got
her
out
and
then
i
cut
up
along
ahind
the
hedge
to
be
beforehand
with
you
an
i
was
it
was
a
fair
cop
matey
eh
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it
francis
asked
flatly
tell
your
father
but
mavis
reflected
that
he
didn
t
seem
to
have
told
his
father
yet
and
perhaps
wouldn
t
ain
t
got
no
father
said
the
spangled
boy
nor
yet
if
you
are
rested
enough
you
d
better
go
on
said
the
mermaid
i
m
getting
dry
and
mavis
understood
that
to
her
that
was
as
bad
as
getting
wet
through
would
be
to
us
i
m
so
sorry
she
said
gently
i
must
say
i
think
it
s
very
inconsiderate
of
you
to
keep
me
all
this
time
in
the
dry
the
mermaid
went
on
i
really
should
have
thought
that
even
but
francis
interrupted
her
what
are
you
going
to
he
asked
the
spangled
boy
and
that
surprising
child
answered
spitting
on
his
hands
and
rubbing
them
do
why
give
a
and
with
the
the
mermaid
put
out
a
white
arm
and
touched
him
you
are
a
hero
she
said
i
can
recognize
true
nobility
even
under
a
exterior
you
may
kiss
my
well
of
all
the
said
francis
shall
i
the
boy
asked
more
of
himself
than
of
the
others
do
mavis
whispered
anything
to
keep
her
in
a
good
so
the
spangled
boy
kissed
the
still
dampish
hand
of
the
lady
from
the
sea
took
the
handles
of
the
barrow
and
off
they
all
went
illustration
mavis
and
francis
were
too
thankful
for
this
unexpected
help
to
ask
any
questions
though
they
could
not
help
wondering
exactly
what
it
felt
like
to
be
a
boy
who
did
not
mind
stealing
his
own
father
s
mermaid
it
was
the
boy
himself
who
offered
at
the
next
an
explanation
you
see
he
said
it
s
like
this
here
this
party
in
the
i
know
you
don
t
mean
it
disrespectfully
said
the
mermaid
sweetly
but
a
lady
suggested
mavis
this
lydy
in
the
chariot
she
d
been
s
how
i
look
at
it
same
as
what
i
this
was
romance
indeed
and
mavis
recognized
it
and
said
you
kidnapped
i
say
yus
said
spangles
when
i
was
a
baby
kid
old
mother
romaine
told
me
just
afore
she
was
took
all
down
one
side
and
never
spoke
no
but
why
mavis
asked
i
never
could
understand
in
the
books
why
gypsies
kidnapped
babies
they
always
seem
to
have
so
many
of
their
far
more
than
anyone
could
possibly
yes
indeed
said
the
mermaid
they
prodded
at
me
with
multitude
of
it
wasn
t
kids
as
was
wanted
said
the
boy
it
was
revenge
that
s
what
mother
romaine
father
he
was
a
sort
of
beak
so
he
give
george
lee
eighteen
months
for
poaching
an
the
day
they
took
him
the
church
bells
was
ringing
like
mad
and
george
as
he
was
being
took
he
said
what
s
all
that
row
it
ain
t
and
then
they
tells
him
as
how
the
bells
was
ringing
cause
him
that
was
the
father
you
d
got
a
son
and
hare
and
that
was
me
you
wouldn
t
think
it
to
look
at
me
he
added
spitting
pensively
and
taking
up
the
barrow
handles
but
i
m
a
son
and
and
then
what
happened
mavis
asked
as
they
trudged
on
oh
done
his
time
and
i
was
a
kiddy
then
old
all
lace
and
ribbons
and
blue
shoes
made
of
and
george
pinched
me
and
it
makes
me
breff
short
wheeling
and
pause
and
rest
my
spangled
friend
said
the
mermaid
in
a
voice
of
honey
and
continue
your
thrilling
there
ain
t
no
more
to
it
said
the
boy
except
that
i
got
one
of
the
shoes
old
mother
romaine
ad
kep
it
and
a
little
shirt
like
a
lady
s
handkercher
with
on
it
in
needlework
she
didn
t
ever
tell
me
what
part
of
the
country
my
dad
was
beak
in
said
she
d
tell
me
next
day
an
then
there
wasn
t
no
next
day
for
fer
telling
things
in
there
wasn
he
rubbed
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
she
wasn
t
half
a
bad
sort
he
explained
don
t
cry
said
mavis
unwisely
cry
me
he
answered
scornfully
i
ve
got
a
cold
in
me
ead
you
oughter
know
the
difference
between
a
cold
in
the
head
and
sniveling
you
been
to
school
i
lay
might
have
taught
you
i
wonder
the
gypsies
didn
t
take
the
shoe
and
the
shirt
away
from
you
nobody
know
d
i
d
got
em
i
always
kep
em
inside
my
shirt
wrapt
up
in
a
bit
of
paper
and
when
i
put
on
me
tights
i
used
to
hide
em
i
m
to
take
the
road
one
of
these
days
and
find
out
who
it
was
lost
a
kid
with
blue
shoes
and
shirt
nine
years
come
then
you
re
ten
and
a
half
said
mavis
and
the
boy
answered
admiringly
how
do
you
do
it
in
your
head
so
quick
miss
yes
that
s
what
i
here
the
wheelbarrow
resumed
its
rather
bumpety
progress
and
nothing
more
could
be
said
till
the
next
stoppage
which
was
at
that
spot
where
the
road
swings
around
and
down
and
glides
into
the
beach
so
gently
that
you
can
hardly
tell
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
it
was
much
lighter
there
than
up
on
the
waste
space
the
moon
was
just
breaking
through
a
fluffy
white
cloud
and
cast
a
trembling
sort
of
reflection
on
the
sea
as
they
came
down
the
slope
all
hands
were
needed
to
steady
the
barrow
because
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
sea
the
mermaid
began
to
jump
up
and
down
like
a
small
child
at
a
christmas
tree
oh
look
she
cried
isn
t
it
beautiful
isn
t
it
the
only
home
in
the
world
not
quite
said
the
boy
ah
said
the
lady
in
the
barrow
of
course
you
re
heir
to
one
of
is
it
stately
homes
of
beautiful
they
stand
said
mavis
yes
said
the
lady
i
knew
by
instinct
that
he
was
of
noble
i
bid
ye
take
care
of
the
brat
said
he
for
he
comes
of
a
noble
race
francis
hummed
he
was
feeling
a
little
cross
and
sore
he
and
mavis
had
had
all
the
anxious
trouble
of
the
adventure
and
now
the
spangled
boy
was
the
only
one
the
mermaid
was
nice
to
it
was
certainly
hard
but
your
stately
home
would
not
do
for
me
at
all
she
went
on
my
idea
of
home
is
all
seaweed
of
coral
and
cosy
and
delightful
and
wet
you
push
the
chariot
to
the
water
s
edge
or
will
you
carry
me
not
much
we
won
t
the
spangled
boy
answered
firmly
we
ll
push
you
as
far
as
we
can
and
then
you
ll
have
to
i
will
do
whatever
you
suggest
she
said
amiably
but
what
is
this
wriggle
of
which
you
speak
like
a
worm
said
francis
or
an
eel
said
mavis
nasty
low
things
said
the
mermaid
and
the
children
never
knew
whether
she
meant
the
worm
and
the
eel
or
the
girl
and
the
boy
now
then
all
together
said
the
spangled
child
and
the
barrow
bumped
down
to
the
very
edge
of
the
rocks
and
at
the
very
edge
its
wheel
caught
in
a
chink
and
the
barrow
went
sideways
nobody
could
help
it
but
the
mermaid
was
tumbled
out
of
her
chariot
on
to
the
seaweed
the
seaweed
was
full
and
cushiony
and
soft
and
she
was
not
hurt
at
she
was
very
angry
you
have
been
to
school
she
said
as
my
noble
preserver
reminds
you
you
might
have
learned
how
not
to
upset
it
s
we
who
are
your
preservers
francis
couldn
t
help
saying
of
course
you
are
she
said
coolly
plain
preservers
not
noble
ones
but
i
forgive
you
you
can
t
help
being
common
and
clumsy
i
suppose
it
s
your
as
it
s
his
to
be
said
francis
firmly
not
at
all
said
the
lady
you
must
come
with
me
in
case
there
are
any
places
where
i
can
t
exercise
the
elegant
and
vermiform
accomplishment
you
spoke
about
now
one
on
each
side
and
one
behind
and
don
t
walk
on
my
tail
you
can
t
think
how
annoying
it
is
to
have
your
tail
walked
illustration
disappeared
oh
can
t
i
said
mavis
i
ll
tell
you
something
my
mother
has
a
tail
i
said
francis
but
the
spangled
child
understood
she
don
t
wear
it
every
day
though
he
said
and
mavis
is
almost
sure
that
he
winked
only
it
is
so
difficult
to
be
sure
about
winks
in
the
starlight
your
mother
must
be
better
born
than
i
supposed
said
the
mermaid
are
you
sure
about
the
tail
i
ve
trodden
on
it
often
said
then
francis
saw
wriggling
and
sliding
and
pushing
herself
along
by
her
hands
and
helped
now
and
then
by
the
hands
of
the
others
the
mermaid
was
at
last
got
to
the
edge
of
the
water
how
glorious
in
a
moment
i
shall
be
quite
wet
she
cried
in
a
moment
everyone
else
was
quite
wet
with
a
movement
that
was
something
between
a
squirm
and
a
jump
she
dropped
from
the
edge
with
a
splashing
flop
and
disappeared
entirely
chapter
five
the
three
children
looked
at
each
other
well
said
mavis
i
do
think
she
s
ungrateful
said
francis
what
did
you
expect
asked
the
spangled
child
they
were
all
wet
through
it
was
very
were
very
tired
and
the
clouds
were
putting
the
moon
to
bed
in
a
very
great
hurry
the
mermaid
was
gone
the
whole
adventure
was
ended
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
home
and
go
to
sleep
knowing
that
when
they
woke
the
next
morning
it
would
be
to
a
day
in
the
course
of
which
they
would
have
to
explain
their
wet
clothes
to
their
parents
even
ll
have
to
do
that
mavis
reminded
the
spangled
boy
he
received
her
remark
in
what
they
afterward
remembered
to
have
been
a
curiously
deep
silence
i
don
t
know
how
on
earth
we
to
explain
said
francis
i
really
don
t
come
s
get
home
no
more
adventures
for
me
thank
you
bernard
knew
what
he
was
talking
mavis
very
tired
indeed
agreed
they
had
got
over
the
beach
by
this
time
recovered
the
wheelbarrow
and
trundled
it
up
and
along
the
road
at
the
corner
the
spangled
boy
suddenly
said
well
then
so
long
old
sports
and
vanished
down
a
side
lane
the
other
two
went
on
the
wheelbarrow
which
i
may
remind
you
was
as
wet
as
any
of
them
they
went
along
by
the
hedge
and
the
mill
and
up
to
the
house
suddenly
mavis
clutched
at
her
brother
s
arm
there
s
a
light
she
said
in
the
there
certainly
was
and
the
children
experienced
that
terrible
empty
sensation
only
too
well
known
to
all
of
feeling
of
the
they
could
not
be
sure
which
window
it
was
but
it
was
a
downstairs
window
partly
screened
by
ivy
a
faint
hope
still
buoyed
up
francis
of
getting
up
to
bed
unnoticed
by
whoever
it
was
that
had
the
light
and
he
and
his
sister
crept
around
to
the
window
out
of
which
they
had
crept
but
such
a
very
long
time
ago
it
seemed
the
window
was
shut
francis
suggested
hiding
in
the
mill
and
trying
to
creep
in
unobserved
later
on
but
mavis
said
no
i
m
too
tired
for
anything
i
m
too
tired
to
i
think
let
s
go
and
get
it
over
and
then
we
can
go
to
bed
and
sleep
and
sleep
and
so
they
went
and
peeped
in
at
the
kitchen
window
and
there
was
no
one
but
pearce
and
she
had
a
fire
lighted
and
was
putting
a
big
pot
on
it
the
children
went
to
the
back
door
and
opened
it
you
re
early
for
sure
said
pearce
not
turning
this
seemed
a
bitter
sarcasm
it
was
too
much
mavis
answered
it
with
a
sob
and
at
that
pearce
turned
very
quickly
what
to
gracious
she
whatever
to
gracious
is
the
matter
where
ve
you
been
she
took
mavis
by
the
shoulder
why
you
re
all
sopping
wet
you
naughty
naughty
little
gell
you
wait
till
i
tell
your
shrimping
i
trying
asking
when
the
tide
was
right
and
not
a
shrimp
to
show
for
it
i
know
with
the
tide
where
it
is
you
wait
till
we
hear
what
your
ma
s
got
to
say
about
it
and
look
at
my
clean
flags
and
you
dripping
all
over
em
like
a
fortnight
s
wash
in
wet
mavis
twisted
a
little
in
pearce
s
grasp
oh
don
t
scold
us
dear
pearce
she
said
putting
a
wet
arm
up
toward
pearce
s
neck
we
so
and
so
you
deserve
to
be
said
pearce
smartly
here
young
chap
you
go
into
the
washhouse
and
get
them
things
off
and
drop
them
outside
the
door
and
have
a
good
rub
with
the
and
little
miss
can
undress
by
the
fire
and
put
hern
in
this
clean
i
ll
pop
up
softlike
and
so
as
your
ma
don
t
hear
and
bring
you
down
something
a
gleam
of
hope
fell
across
the
children
s
gleam
wild
and
watery
as
that
which
the
moonlight
had
cast
across
the
sea
into
which
the
mermaid
had
disappeared
perhaps
after
all
pearce
wasn
t
going
to
tell
mother
if
she
was
why
should
she
pop
up
softlike
perhaps
she
would
keep
their
secret
perhaps
she
would
dry
their
clothes
perhaps
after
all
that
impossible
explanation
would
never
have
to
be
given
the
kitchen
was
a
pleasant
place
with
bright
brasses
and
shining
crockery
and
a
round
table
with
a
clean
cloth
and
teacups
on
it
pearce
came
down
with
their
nightgowns
and
the
warm
dressing
gowns
that
aunt
enid
had
put
in
in
spite
of
their
expressed
wishes
how
glad
they
were
of
them
now
there
that
s
a
bit
more
like
said
pearce
here
don
t
look
as
if
i
was
going
to
eat
you
you
little
peter
grievouses
i
ll
hot
up
some
milk
and
here
s
a
morsel
of
bread
and
dripping
to
keep
the
cold
out
lucky
for
you
i
was
the
boys
breakfast
ready
the
boats
ll
be
in
directly
the
boys
will
laugh
when
i
tell
fit
to
bust
their
selves
they
oh
don
t
tell
said
mavis
don
t
please
don
t
please
please
don
well
i
like
that
said
pearce
pouring
herself
some
tea
from
a
pot
which
the
children
learned
later
stood
on
the
hob
all
day
and
most
of
the
night
it
s
the
funniest
piece
i
ve
heard
this
many
a
day
shrimping
at
high
tide
i
thought
said
mavis
perhaps
you
d
forgive
us
and
dry
our
clothes
and
not
tell
oh
you
did
did
you
said
pearce
anything
no
nothing
else
thank
you
said
mavis
only
i
want
to
say
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
and
it
isn
t
high
tide
yet
and
please
we
haven
t
done
any
harm
to
the
i
m
afraid
it
s
rather
wet
and
we
oughtn
t
to
have
taken
it
without
asking
i
know
but
you
were
in
bed
the
barrow
pearce
repeated
that
great
hulking
took
the
barrow
to
bring
the
shrimps
home
in
can
t
keep
it
to
really
i
can
she
lay
back
in
the
armchair
and
shook
with
silent
laughter
the
children
looked
at
each
other
it
is
not
pleasant
to
be
laughed
at
especially
for
something
you
have
never
they
both
felt
that
pearce
would
have
laughed
quite
as
much
or
even
more
if
they
had
told
her
what
it
really
was
they
had
wanted
the
barrow
for
oh
don
t
go
on
laughing
said
mavis
creeping
close
to
pearce
though
you
are
a
ducky
darling
not
to
be
cross
any
more
and
you
won
t
tell
will
you
ah
ll
let
you
off
this
time
but
you
ll
promise
faithful
never
to
do
it
again
now
won
t
you
we
faithfully
won
t
ever
said
both
children
earnestly
then
off
you
go
to
your
beds
and
i
ll
dry
the
things
when
your
ma
s
out
i
ll
press
em
tomorrow
morning
while
i
m
waiting
for
the
boys
to
come
you
an
angel
said
mavis
embracing
her
more
than
you
are
then
you
young
limbs
said
pearce
returning
the
embrace
now
off
you
go
and
get
what
sleep
you
it
was
with
a
feeling
that
fate
had
not
after
all
been
unduly
harsh
with
them
that
mavis
and
francis
came
down
to
a
very
late
breakfast
your
ma
and
pa
s
gone
off
on
their
bikes
said
pearce
bringing
in
the
eggs
and
bacon
won
t
be
back
till
dinner
so
i
let
you
have
your
sleep
out
the
little
uns
had
theirs
three
hours
ago
and
out
on
the
sands
i
told
them
to
let
you
sleep
though
i
know
they
wanted
to
hear
how
many
shrimps
you
caught
i
lay
they
expected
a
barrowful
same
as
what
you
how
did
you
know
they
knew
we
d
been
out
francis
asked
oh
the
way
they
was
being
secret
in
corners
and
looking
the
old
barrow
all
over
was
enough
to
make
a
cat
laugh
hurry
up
now
i
ve
got
the
to
your
things
is
you
a
darling
said
mavis
suppose
you
d
been
different
whatever
would
have
become
of
us
you
d
a
got
your
and
bread
and
water
instead
of
this
nice
egg
and
bacon
and
the
sands
to
play
on
so
now
you
know
said
pearce
on
the
sands
they
found
kathleen
and
bernard
and
it
really
now
in
the
bright
warm
sunshine
seemed
almost
worthwhile
to
have
gone
through
last
night
s
adventures
if
only
for
the
pleasure
of
telling
the
tale
of
them
to
the
two
who
had
been
safe
and
warm
and
dry
in
bed
all
the
time
though
really
said
mavis
when
the
tale
was
told
sitting
here
and
seeing
the
tents
and
the
children
digging
and
the
ladies
knitting
and
the
gentlemen
smoking
and
throwing
stones
it
does
hardly
seem
as
though
there
be
any
magic
and
yet
you
know
there
it
s
like
i
told
you
about
radium
and
things
said
bernard
things
aren
t
magic
because
they
haven
t
been
found
out
yet
there
s
always
been
mermaids
of
course
only
people
didn
t
know
but
she
talks
said
francis
why
not
said
bernard
placidly
even
parrots
do
but
she
talks
english
mavis
urged
well
said
bernard
unmoved
what
would
you
have
had
her
talk
and
so
in
pretty
sunshine
between
blue
sky
and
good
sands
the
adventure
of
the
mermaid
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
to
be
now
only
as
a
tale
that
is
told
and
when
the
four
went
slowly
home
to
dinner
all
were
i
think
a
little
sad
that
this
should
be
so
let
s
go
around
and
have
a
look
at
the
empty
barrow
mavis
said
it
ll
bring
it
all
back
to
us
and
remind
us
of
what
was
in
it
like
ladies
gloves
and
the
barrow
was
where
they
had
left
it
but
it
was
not
empty
a
very
dirty
piece
of
folded
paper
lay
in
it
addressed
in
penciled
and
uncertain
characters
to
france
to
be
opened
francis
opened
it
and
read
aloud
i
went
back
and
she
came
back
and
she
wants
you
to
come
back
at
ded
of
nite
well
i
shan
t
go
said
francis
a
voice
from
the
bush
by
the
gate
made
them
all
start
don
t
let
on
you
see
me
said
the
spangled
boy
putting
his
head
out
cautiously
you
seem
very
fond
of
hiding
in
bushes
said
francis
i

boy

bernard
impartially
no

said
francis
you
don
t
know
how
disagreeable
she
was
i
m

and
besides
we
simply

dead
of
night
now
pearce

lookout

no
but
you
manage
it
somehow
said
kathleen
you
can
t
let
it
drop
like
this
i
shan
t
believe
it
was
magic
at
all
if
you
if
you
were
us
you
d
have
had
enough
of
magic
said
francis
why
don
t
you
go
and
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
said
bernard
unexpectedly
only
not
in
the
middle
of
the
night
because
of
my
being
certain
to
drop
my
boots
would
you
come
cathay
you
know
i
wanted
to
before
said
kathleen
reproachfully
but
how
the
others
asked

bernard

must
think
about
that
i
say
you
chap
we
must
get
to
our

francis
kindly

they
stop
your
grub
to
punish
you
for
getting
wet
they
didn
t
know
nothing
about
my
getting
wet
he
said
darkly
i

t
never

the
tents

lucky

said
the
spangled
boy
i
m
running
not
chapter
six
mermaid
s
the
parents
of
mavis
francis
kathleen
and
bernard
were
extremely
sensible
people
if
they
had
not
been
this
story
could
never
have
happened
they
were
as
jolly
as
any
father
and
mother
you
ever
met
but
they
were
not
always
fussing
and
worrying
about
their
children
and
they
understood
perfectly
well
that
children
do
not
care
to
be
absolutely
always
under
the
parental
eye
so
that
while
there
were
always
plenty
of
good
times
in
which
the
whole
family
took
part
there
were
also
times
when
father
and
mother
went
off
together
and
enjoyed
themselves
in
their
own
way
while
the
children
enjoyed
themselves
in
theirs
it
happened
that
on
this
particular
afternoon
there
was
to
be
a
concert
at
and
mother
were
going
the
children
were
asked
whether
they
would
like
to
go
and
replied
with
equal
courtesy
and
firmness
very
well
then
said
mother
you
do
whatever
you
like
best
i
should
play
on
the
shore
i
think
if
i
were
you
only
don
t
go
around
the
corner
of
the
cliff
because
that
s
dangerous
at
high
tide
it
s
safe
so
long
as
you
re
within
sight
of
the
coast
guards
anyone
have
any
more
pie
i
think
i
ll
run
and
mother
said
kathleen
suddenly
may
we
take
some
pie
and
things
to
a
little
boy
who
said
he
hadn
t
had
anything
to
eat
since
yesterday
where
is
he
father
asked
kathleen
blushed
purple
but
mavis
cautiously
replied
outside
i
m
sure
we
shall
be
able
to
find
very
well
said
mother
and
you
might
ask
pearce
to
give
you
some
bread
and
cheese
as
well
now
i
must
simply
cathay
and
i
ll
help
you
mother
said
mavis
and
escaped
the
further
questioning
she
saw
in
her
father
s
eye
the
boys
had
slipped
away
at
the
first
word
of
what
seemed
to
be
kathleen
s
amazing
indiscretion
about
the
waiting
rube
it
was
quite
all
right
kathleen
argued
later
as
they
went
up
the
field
carefully
carrying
a
plate
of
plum
pie
and
the
bread
and
cheese
with
not
so
much
care
and
a
certain
bundle
not
carefully
at
all
i
saw
flying
in
mother
s
eye
before
i
spoke
and
if
you
ask
leave
before
you
do
a
thing
it
s
always
and
look
here
said
mavis
if
the
mermaid
wants
to
see
us
we
ve
only
got
to
go
down
and
say
sabrina
fair
and
she
s
certain
to
turn
up
if
it
s
just
seeing
us
she
wants
and
not
another
deadly
night
reuben
did
not
eat
with
such
pretty
manners
as
yours
perhaps
but
there
was
no
doubt
about
his
enjoyment
of
the
food
they
had
brought
though
he
only
stopped
eating
for
half
a
second
to
answer
prime
thank
you
to
kathleen
s
earnest
inquiries
now
said
francis
when
the
last
crumb
of
cheese
had
disappeared
and
the
last
trace
of
plum
juice
had
been
licked
from
the
spoon
a
tin
one
because
as
pearce
very
properly
said
you
never
know
now
look
here
we
re
going
straight
down
to
the
shore
to
try
and
see
her
and
if
you
like
to
come
with
us
we
can
disguise
what
in
reuben
asked
i
did
disguise
myself
once
in
a
false
beard
and
a
mustache
but
it
didn
t
take
no
one
in
for
a
moment
not
even
the
we
thought
said
mavis
gently
that
perhaps
the
most
complete
disguise
for
you
would
be
girl
s
she
added
hastily
to
dispel
the
thundercloud
on
reuben
s
because
you
re
such
a
manly
boy
nobody
would
give
vent
to
a
moment
s
suspicion
it
would
be
so
very
unlike
g
a
said
the
spangled
child
his
dignity
only
half
soothed
and
i
ve
brought
you
some
of
my
things
and
some
sandshoes
of
france
s
because
of
course
mine
are
just
kiddy
at
that
reuben
burst
out
laughing
and
then
hummed
go
flatterer
go
i
ll
not
trust
to
thy
vow
quite
musically
oh
do
you
know
the
gypsy
countess
how
jolly
said
kathleen
old
mother
romaine
knew
a
power
of
songs
he
said
suddenly
grave
come
on
chuck
us
in
the
you
just
take
off
your
coat
and
come
out
and
i
ll
help
you
dress
up
was
francis
s
offer
best
get
a
skirt
over
my
kicksies
first
said
reuben
case
anyone
comes
by
and
recognizes
the
gypsy
cheild
hand
us
in
the
silk
attire
and
jewels
have
to
they
pushed
the
blue
serge
skirt
and
jersey
through
the
branches
which
he
held
apart
now
the
at
he
said
reaching
a
hand
for
it
but
the
hat
was
too
large
for
the
opening
in
the
bush
and
he
had
to
come
out
of
it
the
moment
he
was
out
the
girls
crowned
him
with
the
big
around
whose
crown
a
blue
scarf
was
twisted
and
francis
and
bernard
each
seizing
a
leg
adorned
those
legs
with
brown
stockings
and
white
sandshoes
reuben
the
spangled
runaway
from
the
gypsy
camp
stood
up
among
his
new
friends
a
rather
awkward
and
quite
presentable
little
girl
now
he
said
looking
down
at
his
serge
skirts
with
a
queer
smile
now
we
shan
t
be
nor
were
they
thrusting
the
tin
spoon
and
the
pie
plate
and
the
discarded
boots
of
reuben
into
the
kind
shelter
of
the
bush
they
made
straight
for
the
sea
when
they
got
to
that
pleasant
part
of
the
shore
which
is
smooth
sand
and
piled
shingle
lying
between
low
rocks
and
high
cliffs
bernard
stopped
short
now
look
here
he
said
if
sabrina
fair
turns
up
trumps
i
don
t
mind
going
on
with
the
adventure
but
i
won
t
do
it
if
kathleen
s
to
be
in
it
s
not
fair
said
kathleen
you
said
i
did
i
bernard
most
handsomely
referred
the
matter
to
the
others
yes
you
did
said
francis
shortly
mavis
said
yes
and
reuben
clinched
the
matter
by
saying
why
you
up
and
asked
her
yourself
if
she
d
go
along
of
all
right
said
bernard
calmly
then
i
shan
t
go
myself
that
s
oh
bother
said
at
least
three
of
the
five
and
kathleen
said
i
don
t
see
why
i
should
always
be
out
of
well
said
mavis
impatiently
after
all
there
s
no
danger
in
just
trying
to
the
mermaid
you
promise
you
won
t
do
anything
if
bernard
says
ll
do
i
suppose
though
why
you
should
be
a
slave
to
him
just
because
he
chooses
to
say
you
re
his
particular
sister
i
don
t
see
will
do
bear
i
ll
promise
said
kathleen
almost
in
tears
if
you
ll
only
let
me
come
with
you
all
and
see
the
mermaid
if
she
turns
out
to
be
so
that
was
settled
now
came
the
question
of
where
the
magic
words
should
be
said
mavis
and
francis
voted
for
the
edge
of
the
rocks
where
the
words
had
once
already
been
so
successfully
spoken
bernard
said
why
not
here
where
we
are
kathleen
said
rather
sadly
that
any
place
would
do
as
long
as
the
mermaid
came
when
she
was
called
but
reuben
standing
sturdily
in
his
girl
s
clothes
said
look
ere
when
you
ve
run
away
like
what
i
have
least
said
soonest
mended
and
out
of
sight
s
out
of
mind
what
about
caves
caves
are
too
dry
except
at
high
tide
said
francis
and
then
they
re
too
wet
not
all
caves
reuben
reminded
him
if
we
was
to
turn
and
go
up
by
the
cliff
path
there
s
a
cave
up
there
i
hid
in
it
t
other
day
quite
dry
except
in
one
corner
and
there
it
s
as
wet
as
you
sort
of
orse
trough
in
the
rocks
it
looks
is
it
seawater
mavis
asked
anxiously
and
reuben
said
bound
to
be
so
near
the
sea
and
but
it
wasn
t
for
when
they
had
climbed
the
cliff
path
and
reuben
had
shown
them
where
to
turn
aside
from
it
and
had
put
aside
the
brambles
and
furze
that
quite
hid
the
cave
s
mouth
francis
saw
at
once
that
the
water
here
could
not
be
seawater
it
was
too
far
above
the
line
which
the
waves
reached
even
in
the
stormiest
weather
so
it
s
no
use
he
explained
but
the
others
said
oh
do
let
s
try
now
we
here
and
they
went
on
into
the
dusky
twilight
of
the
cave
it
was
a
very
pretty
cave
not
chalk
like
the
cliffs
but
roofed
and
walled
with
gray
flints
such
as
the
houses
and
churches
are
built
of
that
you
see
on
the
downs
near
brighton
and
eastbourne
this
isn
t
an
accidental
cave
you
know
said
bernard
importantly
it
s
built
by
the
hand
of
man
in
distant
ages
like
stonehenge
and
the
cheesewring
and
kit
s
coty
the
cave
was
lighted
from
the
entrance
where
the
sunshine
crept
faintly
through
the
brambles
their
eyes
soon
grew
used
to
the
gloom
and
they
could
see
that
the
floor
of
the
cave
was
of
dry
white
sand
and
that
along
one
end
was
a
narrow
dark
pool
of
water
ferns
fringed
its
edge
and
drooped
their
fronds
to
its
smooth
surface
which
caught
a
gleam
of
light
and
shone
whitely
but
the
pool
was
very
still
and
they
felt
somehow
without
knowing
why
very
deep
it
s
no
good
no
earthly
said
francis
but
it
s
an
awfully
pretty
cave
said
mavis
consolingly
thank
you
for
showing
it
to
us
reuben
and
it
s
jolly
cool
do
let
s
rest
a
minute
or
two
i
m
simply
boiling
climbing
that
cliff
path
we
ll
go
down
to
the
sea
in
a
minute
reuben
could
wait
here
if
he
felt
all
right
said
bernard
and
the
children
sat
down
at
the
water
s
edge
reuben
still
very
awkward
in
his
girl
s
clothes
it
was
very
very
quiet
only
now
and
then
one
fat
drop
of
water
would
fall
from
the
cave
s
roof
into
that
quiet
pool
and
just
move
its
surface
in
a
spreading
circle
it
s
a
ripping
place
for
a
said
bernard
better
than
that
old
bush
of
yours
anyhow
i
don
t
believe
anybody
knows
of
the
way
don
t
think
anyone
does
either
said
reuben
because
there
wasn
t
any
way
in
till
it
fell
in
two
days
ago
when
i
was
trying
to
dig
up
a
furze
i
should
hide
here
if
you
want
to
hide
said
bernard
i
mean
to
said
reuben
well
if
you
re
rested
let
s
get
on
francis
said
but
kathleen
urged
do
let
s
say
sabrina
fair
to
try
so
they
said
but
the
spangled
child
who
did
not
know
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
the
glassie
cool
there
was
a
splash
and
a
swirl
in
the
pool
and
there
was
the
mermaid
herself
sure
enough
their
eyes
had
grown
used
to
the
dusk
and
they
could
see
her
quite
plainly
could
see
too
that
she
was
holding
out
her
arms
to
them
and
smiling
so
sweetly
that
it
almost
took
their
breath
away
my
cherished
preservers
she
cried
my
dear
darling
kind
brave
noble
unselfish
dears
you
re
talking
to
reuben
in
the
plural
by
mistake
i
suppose
said
francis
a
little
bitterly
to
him
too
of
course
but
you
two
most
of
all
she
said
swishing
her
tail
around
and
leaning
her
hands
on
the
edge
of
the
pool
i
so
sorry
i
was
so
ungrateful
the
other
night
i
ll
tell
you
how
it
was
it
s
in
your
air
you
see
coming
out
of
the
water
we
re
very
susceptible
to
aerial
that
sort
of
ungratefulness
and
what
s
the
snobbishness
said
francis
firmly
is
that
what
you
call
it
most
frightfully
infectious
and
your
air
s
absolutely
crammed
with
the
germs
of
it
that
s
why
i
was
so
horrid
you
do
forgive
me
don
t
you
dears
and
i
was
so
selfish
horrid
but
it
s
all
washed
off
now
in
the
nice
clean
sea
and
i
m
as
sorry
as
if
it
had
been
my
fault
which
it
really
and
truly
wasn
the
children
said
all
right
and
she
wasn
t
to
mind
and
it
didn
t
matter
and
all
the
things
you
say
when
people
say
they
are
sorry
and
you
can
not
kiss
them
and
say
right
oh
which
is
the
natural
answer
to
such
confessions
it
was
very
curious
she
said
thoughtfully
a
most
odd
experience
that
little
boy
his
having
been
born
of
people
who
had
always
been
rich
really
seemed
to
me
to
be
important
i
assure
you
it
did
funny
wasn
t
it
and
now
i
want
you
all
to
come
home
with
me
and
see
where
i
she
smiled
radiantly
at
them
and
they
all
said
thank
you
and
looked
at
each
other
rather
blankly
all
our
people
will
be
unspeakably
pleased
to
see
you
we
are
not
really
ungrateful
you
mustn
t
think
that
she
said
pleadingly
she
looked
very
kind
very
friendly
but
francis
thought
of
the
lorelei
just
so
kind
and
friendly
must
the
lady
of
the
rhine
have
looked
to
the
sailor
in
a
little
skiff
whom
he
had
disentangled
from
heine
s
poem
last
term
with
the
aid
of
the
german
dicker
by
a
curious
coincidence
and
the
same
hard
means
mavis
had
only
last
term
read
of
undine
and
she
tried
not
to
think
that
there
was
any
lack
of
soul
in
the
mermaid
s
kind
eyes
kathleen
who
by
another
coincidence
had
fed
her
fancy
in
english
literature
on
the
forsaken
merman
was
more
at
ease
do
you
mean
down
with
you
under
the
sea
she
the
sea
snakes
coil
and
twine
dry
their
mail
and
bask
in
the
brine
where
great
whales
go
sailing
by
sail
and
sail
with
unshut
eye
round
the
world
for
ever
and
aye
well
it
s
not
exactly
like
that
really
said
the
mermaid
but
you
ll
see
soon
this
had
in
bernard
s
ears
a
sinister
ring
why
he
asked
suddenly
did
you
say
you
wanted
to
see
us
at
dead
of
night
it
s
the
usual
time
isn
t
it
she
asked
looking
at
him
with
innocent
surprise
it
is
in
all
the
stories
you
know
we
have
air
stories
just
as
you
have
fairy
stories
and
water
the
rescuer
almost
always
comes
to
the
castle
gate
at
dead
of
night
on
a
steed
or
a
you
know
or
a
steed
of
might
but
as
there
were
four
of
you
besides
me
and
my
tail
i
thought
it
more
considerate
to
suggest
a
chariot
now
we
really
ought
to
be
which
way
asked
bernard
and
everyone
held
their
breath
to
hear
the
answer
the
way
i
came
of
course
she
answered
down
here
and
she
pointed
to
the
water
that
rippled
around
her
thank
you
so
very
much
said
mavis
in
a
voice
which
trembled
a
little
but
i
don
t
know
whether
you
ve
heard
that
people
who
go
down
into
the
water
like
like
tails
you
get
not
if
they
re
personally
conducted
said
the
mermaid
of
course
we
can
t
be
responsible
for
trespassers
though
even
with
them
i
don
t
think
anything
very
dreadful
has
ever
happened
someone
once
told
me
a
story
about
water
babies
did
you
ever
hear
of
that
yes
but
that
was
a
story
said
bernard
stolidly
yes
of
course
she
agreed
but
a
great
deal
of
it
s
quite
true
all
the
same
but
you
won
t
grow
fins
and
gills
or
anything
like
that
you
needn
t
be
the
children
looked
at
each
other
and
then
all
looked
at
francis
he
spoke
thank
you
he
said
thank
you
very
much
but
we
would
rather
oh
nonsense
said
the
lady
kindly
look
here
it
s
as
easy
as
easy
i
give
you
each
a
lock
of
my
hair
she
cut
off
the
locks
with
her
shell
knife
as
she
spoke
long
locks
they
were
and
soft
look
here
tie
these
round
your
i
d
had
a
lock
of
human
hair
round
my
neck
i
should
never
have
suffered
from
the
dryness
as
i
did
and
then
just
jump
in
keep
your
eyes
shut
it
s
rather
confusing
if
you
don
t
but
there
s
no
the
children
took
the
locks
of
hair
but
no
one
regarded
them
with
any
confidence
at
all
as
lifesaving
apparatus
they
still
hung
back
you
really
are
silly
said
the
sea
lady
indulgently
why
did
you
meddle
with
magic
at
all
if
you
weren
t
prepared
to
go
through
with
it
why
this
is
one
of
the
simplest
forms
of
magic
and
the
safest
whatever
would
you
have
done
if
you
had
happened
to
call
up
a
fire
spirit
and
had
had
to
go
down
vesuvius
with
a
salamander
round
your
little
necks
she
laughed
merrily
at
the
thought
but
her
laugh
sounded
a
little
angry
too
come
don
t
be
foolish
she
said
you
ll
never
have
such
a
chance
again
and
i
feel
that
this
air
is
full
of
your
horrid
human
suspicion
fear
anger
little
germs
i
don
t
want
to
risk
catching
them
no
said
francis
and
held
out
to
her
the
lock
of
her
hair
so
did
mavis
and
bernard
but
kathleen
had
tied
the
lock
of
hair
round
her
neck
and
she
said
i
have
liked
to
but
i
promised
bernard
i
would
not
do
anything
unless
he
said
i
it
was
toward
kathleen
that
the
mermaid
turned
holding
out
a
white
hand
for
the
lock
kathleen
bent
over
the
water
trying
to
untie
it
and
in
one
awful
instant
the
mermaid
had
reared
herself
up
in
the
water
caught
kathleen
in
her
long
white
arms
pulled
her
over
the
edge
of
the
pool
and
with
a
bubbling
splash
disappeared
with
her
beneath
the
dark
water
illustration
caught
kathleen
in
her
mavis
screamed
and
knew
it
francis
and
bernard
thought
they
did
not
scream
it
was
the
spangled
child
alone
who
said
nothing
he
had
not
offered
to
give
back
the
lock
of
soft
hair
he
like
kathleen
had
knotted
it
round
his
neck
he
now
tied
a
further
knot
stepped
forward
and
spoke
in
tones
which
the
other
three
thought
the
most
noble
they
had
ever
heard
she
give
me
the
plum
pie
he
said
and
leaped
into
the
water
he
sank
at
once
and
this
curiously
enough
gave
the
others
confidence
if
he
had
sank
like
a
stone
or
like
a
diver
who
means
diving
and
diving
to
the
very
bottom
she
s
my
special
sister
said
bernard
and
leaped
if
it
s
magic
it
s
all
if
it
isn
t
we
couldn
t
go
back
home
without
her
said
mavis
hoarsely
and
she
and
francis
took
hands
and
jumped
together
it
was
not
so
difficult
as
it
sounds
from
the
moment
of
kathleen
s
disappearance
the
sense
of
is
rather
like
very
sleepy
comfort
and
sweet
scent
and
sweet
music
that
you
just
can
t
hear
the
tune
been
growing
stronger
and
stronger
and
there
are
some
things
so
horrible
that
if
you
can
bring
yourself
to
face
them
you
simply
believe
that
they
re
true
it
did
not
seem
they
came
quite
close
to
the
a
mermaid
could
really
come
and
talk
so
kindly
and
then
drown
the
five
children
who
had
rescued
her
it
s
all
right
francis
cried
as
they
jumped
i
he
shut
his
mouth
just
in
time
and
down
they
went
you
have
probably
dreamed
that
you
were
a
perfect
swimmer
you
know
the
delight
of
that
which
is
no
effort
at
all
and
yet
carries
you
as
far
and
as
fast
as
you
choose
it
was
like
that
with
the
children
the
moment
they
touched
the
water
they
felt
that
they
belonged
in
they
were
as
much
at
home
in
water
as
in
air
as
they
sank
beneath
the
water
their
feet
went
up
and
their
heads
went
down
and
there
they
were
swimming
downward
with
long
steady
easy
strokes
it
was
like
swimming
down
a
well
that
presently
widened
to
a
cavern
suddenly
francis
found
that
his
head
was
above
water
so
was
mavis
s
all
right
so
far
she
said
but
how
are
we
going
to
get
back
oh
the
magic
will
do
that
he
answered
and
swam
faster
the
cave
was
lighted
by
bars
of
phosphorescence
placed
like
pillars
against
the
walls
the
water
was
clear
and
deeply
green
and
along
the
sides
of
the
stream
were
sea
anemones
and
starfish
of
the
most
beautiful
forms
and
the
most
dazzling
colors
the
walls
were
of
dark
squarish
shapes
and
here
and
there
a
white
oblong
or
a
blue
and
a
red
and
the
roof
was
of
which
gleamed
and
glistened
in
the
pale
golden
radiance
of
the
phosphorescent
pillars
it
was
very
beautiful
and
the
mere
pleasure
of
swimming
so
finely
and
easily
swept
away
almost
their
last
fear
this
too
went
when
a
voice
far
ahead
called
hurry
up
on
mavis
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
kathleen
they
hurried
up
and
they
came
on
and
the
gleaming
soft
light
grew
brighter
and
brighter
it
shone
all
along
the
way
they
had
to
go
making
a
path
of
glory
such
as
the
moon
makes
across
the
sea
on
a
summer
night
and
presently
they
saw
that
this
growing
light
was
from
a
great
gate
that
barred
the
waterway
in
front
of
them
five
steps
led
up
to
this
gate
and
sitting
on
it
waiting
for
them
were
kathleen
reuben
bernard
and
the
mermaid
only
now
she
had
no
tail
it
lay
beside
her
on
the
marble
steps
just
as
your
stockings
lie
when
you
have
taken
them
off
and
there
were
her
white
feet
sticking
out
from
under
a
dress
of
soft
feathery
red
seaweed
they
could
see
it
was
seaweed
though
it
was
woven
into
a
wonderful
fabric
bernard
and
kathleen
and
the
spangled
boy
had
somehow
got
seaweed
dresses
too
and
the
spangled
boy
was
no
longer
dressed
as
a
girl
and
looking
down
as
they
scrambled
up
the
steps
mavis
and
francis
saw
that
they
too
wore
seaweed
very
pretty
but
how
awkward
to
go
home
in
mavis
thought
illustration
golden
now
said
the
forgive
me
for
taking
the
plunge
i
knew
you
d
hesitate
forever
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
so
cross
that
s
your
dreadful
atmosphere
now
here
we
are
at
the
door
of
our
kingdom
you
do
want
to
come
in
don
t
you
i
can
bring
you
as
far
as
this
against
your
will
but
not
any
farther
and
you
can
t
come
any
farther
unless
you
trust
me
absolutely
do
you
will
you
try
yes
said
the
children
all
but
bernard
who
said
stoutly
i
don
t
but
i
ll
try
to
i
want
if
you
want
to
i
think
you
said
she
very
kindly
and
now
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
what
you
re
breathing
isn
t
air
and
it
isn
t
water
it
s
something
that
both
water
people
and
air
people
can
the
greatest
common
measure
said
bernard
a
simple
equation
said
mavis
things
which
are
equal
to
the
same
thing
are
equal
to
each
other
said
francis
and
the
three
looked
at
each
other
and
wondered
why
they
had
said
such
things
don
t
worry
said
the
lady
it
s
only
the
influence
of
the
place
this
is
the
cave
of
learning
you
know
very
dark
at
the
beginning
and
getting
lighter
and
lighter
as
you
get
nearer
to
the
golden
door
all
these
rocks
are
made
of
books
really
and
they
exude
learning
from
every
crack
we
cover
them
up
with
anemones
and
seaweed
and
pretty
things
as
well
as
we
can
but
the
learning
will
leak
out
let
us
go
through
the
gate
or
you
ll
all
be
talking
sanskrit
before
we
know
where
we
she
opened
the
gate
a
great
flood
of
glorious
sunlight
met
them
the
solace
of
green
trees
and
the
jeweled
grace
of
bright
blossoms
she
pulled
them
through
the
door
and
shut
it
this
is
where
we
live
she
said
aren
t
you
glad
you
came
chapter
seven
skies
are
as
the
children
passed
through
the
golden
doors
a
sort
of
swollen
feeling
which
was
beginning
to
make
their
heads
quite
uncomfortable
passed
away
and
left
them
with
a
curiously
clear
and
comfortable
certainty
that
they
were
much
cleverer
than
usual
i
do
sums
now
and
no
mistake
bernard
whispered
to
kathleen
who
replied
to
the
effect
that
dates
no
longer
presented
the
slightest
difficulty
to
her
mavis
and
francis
felt
as
though
they
had
never
before
known
what
it
was
to
have
a
clear
brain
they
followed
the
others
through
the
golden
door
and
then
came
reuben
and
the
mermaid
came
last
she
had
picked
up
her
discarded
tail
and
was
carrying
it
over
her
arm
as
you
might
a
shawl
she
shut
the
gate
and
its
lock
clicked
sharply
we
have
to
be
careful
you
know
she
said
because
of
the
people
in
the
books
they
are
always
trying
to
get
out
of
the
books
that
the
cave
is
made
of
and
some
of
them
are
very
undesirable
characters
there
s
a
ve
had
a
great
deal
of
trouble
with
her
and
a
person
called
markham
who
makes
everybody
miserable
and
a
lot
of
people
who
think
they
are
being
funny
when
they
aren
the
party
was
now
walking
along
a
smooth
grassy
path
between
tall
clipped
box
least
they
looked
like
box
hedges
but
when
mavis
stroked
the
close
face
of
one
she
found
that
it
was
not
stiff
box
but
soft
seaweed
are
we
in
the
water
or
not
said
she
stopping
suddenly
that
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
water
water
s
a
thing
human
beings
can
t
breathe
isn
t
it
well
you
are
breathing
so
this
can
t
be
i
see
that
said
mavis
but
the
soft
seaweed
won
t
stand
up
in
air
and
it
does
in
oh
you
ve
found
out
have
you
said
the
mermaid
well
then
perhaps
it
is
water
only
you
see
it
can
t
be
everything
s
like
that
down
once
you
said
you
lived
in
water
and
you
wanted
to
be
wet
said
mavis
aren
t
responsible
for
what
they
say
in
your
world
i
told
you
that
you
know
the
mermaid
reminded
them
presently
they
came
to
a
little
coral
bridge
over
a
stream
that
flowed
still
and
deep
but
if
what
we
re
in
is
water
what
s
that
said
bernard
pointing
down
ah
now
you
re
going
too
deep
for
me
said
the
mermaid
at
least
if
i
were
to
answer
i
should
go
too
deep
for
you
come
shall
be
too
late
for
the
what
do
you
have
for
the
banquet
bernard
asked
and
the
mermaid
answered
sweetly
things
to
and
to
drink
it
s
no
use
said
she
you
can
t
get
at
it
that
way
we
you
wouldn
t
here
the
grassy
road
widened
and
they
came
onto
a
terrace
of
very
smooth
and
shining
pearly
steps
led
down
from
it
into
the
most
beautiful
garden
you
could
invent
if
you
tried
for
a
year
and
a
day
with
all
the
loveliest
pictures
and
the
most
learned
books
on
gardening
to
help
you
but
the
odd
thing
about
it
was
that
when
they
came
to
talk
it
over
afterward
they
never
could
agree
about
the
shape
of
the
beds
the
direction
of
the
walks
the
kinds
and
colors
of
the
flowers
or
indeed
any
single
thing
about
it
but
to
each
it
seemed
and
will
always
seem
the
most
beautiful
garden
ever
imagined
or
invented
and
everyone
saw
beyond
a
distant
belt
of
trees
the
shining
domes
and
minarets
of
very
beautiful
buildings
and
far
far
away
there
was
a
sound
of
music
so
far
away
that
at
first
they
could
only
hear
the
music
and
not
the
tune
but
soon
that
too
was
plain
and
it
was
the
most
beautiful
tune
in
the
world
crikey
said
reuben
speaking
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
ain
t
it
evingly
neither
not
arf
he
added
with
decision
now
said
the
mermaid
as
they
neared
the
belt
of
trees
you
are
going
to
receive
oh
thank
you
said
everybody
and
no
one
liked
to
add
what
that
simple
word
trembled
on
every
tongue
it
slipped
off
the
tip
of
reuben
s
indeed
at
last
and
the
mermaid
answered
an
that
s
something
to
do
with
eggs
i
know
said
kathleen
father
was
saying
so
only
the
other
there
will
be
no
eggs
in
this
said
the
mermaid
and
you
may
find
it
a
trifle
heavy
but
when
it
is
over
the
fun
begins
don
t
be
frightened
don
t
smooth
your
hair
ugly
untidiness
is
impossible
here
you
are
about
to
be
publicly
thanked
by
our
queen
you
d
rather
not
you
should
have
thought
of
that
before
if
you
will
go
about
doing
these
noble
deeds
of
rescue
you
must
expect
to
be
thanked
now
don
t
forget
to
bow
and
there
s
nothing
to
be
frightened
they
passed
through
the
trees
and
came
on
a
sort
of
open
courtyard
in
front
of
a
palace
of
gleaming
pearl
and
gold
there
on
a
silver
throne
sat
the
loveliest
lady
in
the
world
she
wore
a
starry
crown
and
a
gown
of
green
and
golden
shoes
and
she
smiled
at
them
so
kindly
that
they
forgot
any
fear
they
may
have
felt
the
music
ended
on
a
note
of
piercing
sweetness
and
in
the
great
hush
that
followed
the
children
felt
themselves
gently
pushed
forward
to
the
foot
of
the
throne
all
around
was
a
great
crowd
forming
a
circle
about
the
pearly
pavement
on
which
they
stood
the
queen
rose
up
in
her
place
and
reached
toward
them
the
end
of
her
scepter
where
shone
a
star
like
those
that
crowned
her
welcome
she
said
in
a
voice
far
sweeter
than
the
music
welcome
to
our
home
you
have
been
kind
you
have
been
brave
you
have
been
unselfish
and
all
my
subjects
do
homage
to
at
the
word
the
whole
of
that
great
crowd
bent
toward
them
like
bulrushes
in
the
wind
and
the
queen
herself
came
down
the
steps
of
her
throne
and
held
out
her
hands
to
the
children
a
choking
feeling
in
their
throats
became
almost
unbearable
as
those
kind
hands
rested
on
one
head
after
another
then
the
crowd
raised
itself
and
stood
upright
and
someone
called
out
in
a
voice
like
a
trumpet
the
children
saved
one
of
die
in
shout
for
the
children
shout
and
a
roar
like
the
roar
of
wild
waves
breaking
on
rocks
went
up
from
the
great
crowd
that
stood
all
about
them
there
was
a
fluttering
of
flags
or
children
could
not
tell
then
the
voice
of
their
own
mermaid
saying
s
over
and
now
we
shall
have
the
banquet
shan
t
we
mamma
yes
my
daughter
said
the
queen
so
the
mermaid
they
had
rescued
was
a
queen
s
daughter
i
didn
t
know
you
were
a
princess
said
mavis
as
they
followed
the
queen
along
a
corridor
that
s
why
they
have
made
such
a
fuss
i
suppose
said
bernard
oh
no
we
should
have
given
the
ovation
to
anyone
who
had
saved
any
of
us
from
captivity
we
love
giving
ovations
only
we
so
seldom
get
the
chance
and
even
ordinary
entertaining
is
difficult
people
are
so
prejudiced
we
can
hardly
ever
get
anyone
to
come
and
visit
us
i
shouldn
t
have
got
you
if
you
hadn
t
happened
to
find
that
cave
it
would
have
been
quite
impossible
for
me
to
give
kathleen
that
clinging
embrace
from
shallow
water
the
cave
water
is
so
much
more
buoyant
than
the
sea
i
daresay
you
noticed
had
may
we
sit
next
you
at
the
banquet
kathleen
asked
suddenly
because
you
know
it
s
all
rather
strange
to
of
course
dear
said
the
sea
lady
but
said
bernard
i
m
awfully
sorry
but
i
think
we
ought
to
go
oh
don
t
talk
of
it
said
the
mermaid
why
you
ve
only
just
bernard
muttered
something
about
getting
home
in
time
to
wash
for
tea
there
ll
be
heaps
of
time
said
francis
impatiently
don
t
fuss
and
spoil
i
m
not
fussing
said
bernard
stolid
as
ever
i
never
fuss
but
i
think
we
ought
to
be
thinking
of
getting
well
think
about
it
then
said
francis
impatiently
and
turned
to
admire
the
clusters
of
scarlet
flowers
that
hung
from
the
pillars
of
the
gallery
the
banquet
was
very
magnificent
but
they
never
could
remember
afterward
what
it
was
that
they
ate
out
of
the
silver
dishes
and
drank
out
of
the
golden
cups
they
none
of
them
forgot
the
footmen
however
who
were
dressed
in
suits
of
silver
scales
with
silver
fingerless
gloves
and
a
sort
of
helmet
on
that
made
them
look
less
like
people
than
like
fish
as
kathleen
said
but
they
fish
said
the
princess
opening
her
beautiful
eyes
they
re
the
salmoners
and
the
one
behind
mother
s
chair
is
the
grand
salmoner
in
your
country
i
have
heard
there
are
grand
almoners
we
have
grand
are
all
your
servants
fish
mavis
asked
of
course
said
the
princess
but
we
don
t
use
servants
much
except
for
state
occasions
most
of
our
work
is
done
by
the
lower
eels
most
of
them
we
get
all
the
power
for
our
machinery
from
how
do
you
do
it
bernard
asked
with
a
fleeting
vision
of
being
some
day
known
as
the
great
man
who
discovered
the
commercial
value
of
the
electricity
obtainable
from
eels
we
keep
a
tank
of
them
said
she
and
you
just
turn
a
re
connected
up
to
people
s
you
connect
them
with
your
looms
or
lathes
or
whatever
you
re
working
that
sets
up
a
continuous
current
and
the
eels
swim
around
and
around
in
the
current
till
the
work
s
done
it
s
beautifully
it
s
simply
beautiful
said
mavis
warmly
i
mean
all
she
waved
her
hand
to
the
row
of
white
arches
through
which
the
green
of
the
garden
and
the
blue
of
what
looked
like
the
sky
showed
plainly
and
you
live
down
here
and
do
nothing
but
play
all
day
long
how
you
d
soon
get
tired
of
play
if
you
did
nothing
else
said
bernard
wisely
at
least
i
know
i
should
did
you
ever
make
a
steam
engine
he
asked
the
princess
that
s
what
i
call
it
would
be
to
me
she
said
but
don
t
you
know
that
work
is
what
you
have
to
do
and
don
t
like
doing
and
play
s
whatever
you
want
to
do
have
some
more
andrew
she
made
a
sign
to
a
salmoner
who
approached
with
a
great
salver
of
fruit
the
company
were
seated
by
fours
and
fives
and
sixes
at
little
tables
such
as
you
see
in
the
dining
rooms
of
the
big
hotels
where
people
feed
who
have
motors
these
little
tables
are
good
for
conversation
then
what
you
do
kathleen
asked
well
we
have
to
keep
all
the
rivers
flowing
for
one
earthly
rivers
i
to
see
to
the
rain
and
snow
taps
and
to
attend
to
the
tides
and
whirlpools
and
open
the
cages
where
the
winds
are
kept
oh
it
s
no
easy
business
being
a
princess
in
our
country
i
can
tell
you
whatever
it
may
be
in
yours
what
do
your
princesses
do
do
they
open
the
wind
cages
i
i
don
t
know
said
the
children
i
think
they
only
open
mother
says
they
work
awfully
hard
and
they
go
and
see
people
who
are
ill
in
hospitals
kathleen
was
beginning
but
at
this
moment
the
queen
rose
and
so
did
everyone
else
come
said
the
princess
i
must
go
and
take
my
turn
at
only
princesses
can
do
the
finest
sort
of
what
is
the
hardest
thing
you
have
to
do
francis
asked
as
they
walked
out
into
the
garden
keeping
the
sea
out
of
our
kingdom
was
the
answer
and
fighting
the
under
folk
we
kept
the
sea
out
by
trying
very
hard
with
both
hands
inside
our
minds
and
of
course
the
sky
and
how
do
you
fight
the
under
who
are
they
bernard
wanted
to
know
why
the
heavy
people
who
live
in
the
deep
different
from
you
kathleen
asked
my
dear
child
she
means
explained
mavis
that
we
didn
t
know
there
were
any
other
kind
of
people
in
the
sea
except
your
you
know
much
less
about
us
than
we
do
about
you
said
the
princess
of
course
there
are
different
nations
and
tribes
and
different
customs
and
dresses
and
everything
but
there
are
two
great
divisions
down
here
besides
us
the
and
the
and
we
have
to
fight
both
of
them
the
live
near
the
surface
of
the
water
frivolous
silly
things
like
nautiluses
and
flying
fish
very
pleasant
but
deceitful
and
they
are
very
treacherous
the
live
in
the
cold
deep
dark
waters
they
are
desperate
do
you
ever
go
down
there
the
princess
shuddered
no
she
said
but
we
might
have
to
if
the
water
ever
came
into
our
kingdom
they
would
attack
us
and
we
should
have
to
drive
them
out
and
then
we
should
have
to
drive
them
right
down
to
their
own
kingdom
again
it
happened
once
in
my
grandfather
s
but
how
on
earth
asked
bernard
did
you
ever
get
the
water
out
again
it
wasn
t
on
earth
you
know
said
the
princess
and
the
whales
blew
a
good
deal
of
it
grampuses
did
their
best
but
they
don
t
blow
hard
enough
and
the
octopuses
finished
the
work
by
sucking
the
water
out
with
their
do
you
have
cats
here
then
asked
kathleen
whose
attention
had
wandered
and
had
only
caught
a
word
that
sounded
like
pussies
only
octopussies
said
the
princess
but
then
they
re
eight
times
as
pussy
as
your
what
kathleen
s
attention
had
wandered
to
was
a
tall
lady
standing
on
a
marble
pedestal
in
the
middle
of
a
pool
she
held
a
big
vase
over
her
head
and
from
it
poured
a
thin
stream
of
water
this
stream
fell
in
an
arch
right
across
the
pool
into
a
narrow
channel
cut
in
the
marble
of
the
square
in
which
they
now
stood
ran
across
the
square
and
disappeared
under
a
dark
arch
in
the
face
of
the
rock
there
said
the
princess
stopping
what
is
it
asked
reuben
who
had
been
singularly
silent
this
she
said
simply
is
the
source
of
the
nile
and
of
all
other
rivers
and
it
s
my
turn
now
i
must
not
speak
again
till
my
term
of
is
at
an
end
do
what
you
will
go
where
you
will
all
is
yours
only
beware
that
you
do
not
touch
the
sky
if
once
profane
hands
touch
the
sky
the
whole
heaven
is
she
ran
a
few
steps
jumped
and
landed
on
the
marble
pedestal
without
touching
the
lady
who
stood
there
already
then
with
the
utmost
care
so
that
the
curved
arc
of
the
water
should
not
be
slackened
or
diverted
she
took
the
vase
in
her
hands
and
the
other
lady
in
her
turn
leaped
across
the
pool
and
stood
beside
the
children
and
greeted
them
kindly
i
am
maia
my
sister
has
told
me
all
you
did
for
her
she
said
it
was
i
who
pinched
your
foot
and
as
she
spoke
they
knew
the
voice
that
had
said
among
the
rocks
at
beachfield
save
her
we
die
in
what
will
you
do
she
asked
while
my
sister
performs
her
wait
i
suppose
said
bernard
you
see
we
want
to
know
about
going
didn
t
you
fix
a
time
to
be
recalled
asked
maia
and
when
they
said
no
her
beautiful
smiling
face
suddenly
looked
grave
with
whom
have
you
left
the
charge
of
speaking
the
spell
of
recall
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
said
bernard
what
spell
the
one
which
enabled
me
to
speak
to
you
that
day
in
the
shallows
said
maia
of
course
my
sister
explained
to
you
that
the
spell
which
enables
us
to
come
at
your
call
is
the
only
one
by
which
you
can
yourselves
she
didn
t
said
mavis
ah
she
is
young
and
impulsive
but
no
doubt
she
arranged
with
someone
to
speak
the
spell
and
recall
you
no
she
didn
t
she
doesn
t
know
any
land
people
except
us
she
told
me
so
said
kathleen
well
is
the
spell
written
anywhere
maia
asked
under
a
picture
they
told
her
not
knowing
that
it
was
also
written
in
the
works
of
john
milton
then
i
m
afraid
you
ll
have
to
wait
til
someone
happens
to
read
what
is
under
the
picture
said
maia
kindly
but
the
house
is
locked
up
there
s
no
one
there
to
read
anything
bernard
reminded
them
there
was
a
dismal
silence
then
perhaps
burglars
will
break
in
and
read
it
suggested
reuben
kindly
anyhow
what
s
the
use
of
kicking
up
a
shine
about
it
can
t
see
what
you
want
to
go
back
for
it
s
a
little
bit
of
all
right
here
so
it
think
plucky
sight
better
than
anything
ever
come
across
i
m
to
enjoy
myself
i
am
and
see
all
the
sights
miss
there
said
we
well
spoken
indeed
said
maia
smiling
at
his
earnest
face
that
is
the
true
spirit
of
the
but
we
re
not
explorers
said
mavis
a
little
crossly
for
her
and
we
re
not
so
selfish
as
you
think
either
mother
will
be
awfully
frightened
if
we
re
not
home
to
tea
she
ll
think
we
re
well
you
drowned
said
maia
brightly
at
least
that
s
what
i
believe
you
land
people
call
it
when
you
come
down
to
us
and
neglect
to
arrange
to
have
the
spell
of
return
said
for
how
horrible
said
mavis
oh
cathay
and
she
clutched
her
sister
tightly
but
you
needn
t
drowned
said
the
princess
someone
s
sure
to
say
the
spell
somehow
or
other
i
assure
you
that
this
is
true
and
then
you
will
go
home
with
the
speed
of
an
they
felt
somehow
in
their
bones
that
this
was
true
and
it
consoled
them
a
little
things
which
you
feel
in
your
bones
are
most
convincing
but
mother
said
mavis
you
don
t
seem
to
know
much
about
magic
said
maia
pityingly
the
first
principle
of
magic
is
that
time
spent
in
other
worlds
doesn
t
count
in
your
own
home
no
i
see
you
don
t
understand
in
your
home
it
s
still
the
same
time
as
it
was
when
you
dived
into
the
well
in
the
but
that
s
hours
ago
said
bernard
and
she
answered
i
know
but
your
time
is
not
like
our
time
at
what
s
the
difference
i
can
t
explain
said
the
princess
you
can
t
compare
them
any
more
than
you
can
compare
a
starlight
and
a
starfish
they
re
quite
quite
different
but
the
really
important
thing
is
that
your
mother
won
t
be
anxious
so
now
why
not
enjoy
yourselves
and
all
this
time
the
other
princess
had
been
holding
up
the
jar
which
was
the
source
of
all
the
rivers
in
all
the
world
won
t
she
be
very
tired
asked
reuben
yes
but
suppose
all
the
rivers
dried
she
had
to
know
how
people
were
would
be
something
much
harder
to
bear
than
tiredness
look
in
the
pool
and
see
what
she
is
doing
for
the
they
looked
and
it
was
like
a
colored
cinematograph
and
the
pictures
melted
into
one
another
like
the
old
dissolving
views
that
children
used
to
love
so
before
cinematographs
were
thought
of
they
saw
the
red
indians
building
their
wigwams
by
the
great
the
beavers
building
their
dams
across
the
little
rivers
they
saw
brown
men
setting
their
fish
traps
by
the
nile
and
brown
girls
sending
out
little
on
the
ganges
they
saw
the
stormy
splendor
of
the
lawrence
and
the
medway
s
pastoral
peace
little
streams
dappled
with
sunlight
and
the
shadow
of
green
leaves
and
the
dark
and
secret
torrents
that
tear
through
the
underworld
in
caverns
and
hidden
places
they
saw
women
washing
clothes
in
the
seine
and
boys
sailing
boats
on
the
serpentine
naked
savages
dancing
in
masks
beside
tropical
streams
overshadowed
by
strange
trees
and
flowers
that
we
do
not
men
in
flannels
and
girls
in
pink
and
blue
punting
in
the
backwaters
of
the
thames
they
saw
niagara
and
the
zambesi
falls
and
all
the
time
the
surface
of
the
pool
was
smooth
as
a
mirror
and
the
arched
stream
that
was
the
source
of
all
they
saw
poured
ceaselessly
over
their
heads
and
fell
splashing
softly
into
its
little
marble
channel
i
don
t
know
how
long
they
would
have
stayed
leaning
their
elbows
on
the
cool
parapet
and
looking
down
on
the
changing
pictures
but
suddenly
a
trumpet
sounded
drums
beat
and
everyone
looked
up
it
s
for
the
review
said
maia
through
the
rattle
of
the
drums
do
you
care
for
soldiers
rather
said
bernard
but
i
didn
t
know
you
had
we
re
very
proud
of
our
troops
said
the
princess
i
am
colonel
of
the
lobster
battalion
and
my
sister
commands
the
crustacean
brigade
but
we
re
not
going
on
parade
the
sound
of
drums
was
drawing
nearer
this
way
to
the
parade
ground
said
the
princess
leading
the
way
they
looked
at
the
review
through
a
big
arch
and
it
was
like
looking
into
a
very
big
aquarium
the
first
regiment
they
saw
was
as
it
happened
the
lobsters
if
you
can
imagine
a
lobster
as
big
as
a
guardsman
and
rather
stouter
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
splendid
appearance
of
this
regiment
only
don
t
forget
that
lobsters
in
their
natural
regimentals
are
not
red
they
wear
a
sort
of
armor
and
carry
arms
of
dreadful
precision
they
are
terrible
fellows
the
and
they
marched
with
an
air
at
once
proud
and
confident
then
came
the
uniform
of
delicate
silver
their
drawn
swords
displayed
the
queen
s
own
gurnards
were
magnificent
in
pink
and
silver
with
real
helmets
and
spiked
collars
and
the
boy
the
sea
urchins
as
they
were
familiarly
the
last
of
the
infantry
then
came
mounted
on
dolphins
and
sea
horses
and
the
cetacean
regiments
riding
on
their
whales
each
whale
carried
a
squadron
they
look
like
great
trams
going
by
said
francis
and
so
they
did
the
children
remarked
that
while
the
infantry
walked
upright
like
any
other
foot
soldiers
the
cavalry
troops
seemed
to
be
with
their
mounts
suspended
in
the
air
about
a
foot
from
the
ground
and
that
shows
it
s
water
said
bernard
no
it
doesn
t
said
francis
well
a
whale
s
not
a
bird
said
bernard
and
there
are
other
things
besides
air
and
water
said
francis
the
household
brigade
was
perhaps
the
handsomest
the
grand
salmoner
led
his
silvery
soldiers
and
the
halibuts
were
evidently
the
sort
of
troops
to
make
the
foes
of
anywhere
feel
sorry
they
were
it
was
a
glorious
review
and
when
it
was
over
the
children
found
that
they
had
been
quite
forgetting
their
desire
to
get
home
but
as
the
back
of
the
last
halibut
vanished
behind
the
seaweed
trees
the
desire
came
back
with
full
force
princess
maia
had
disappeared
their
own
princess
was
they
supposed
still
performing
her
suddenly
everything
seemed
to
have
grown
tiresome
oh
i
do
wish
we
could
go
home
said
kathleen
couldn
t
we
just
find
the
door
and
go
out
we
might
for
the
door
said
bernard
cautiously
but
i
don
t
see
how
we
could
get
up
into
the
cave
we
can
swim
all
right
you
know
mavis
reminded
them
i
think
it
would
be
pretty
low
down
to
go
without
saying
to
the
princesses
said
francis
still
there
s
no
harm
in
for
the
they
did
look
for
the
door
and
they
did
not
find
it
what
they
did
find
was
a
great
gray
wall
built
of
solid
it
nothing
could
be
seen
but
blue
sky
i
do
wonder
what
s
on
the
other
side
said
bernard
and
someone
i
will
not
say
which
said
let
s
climb
up
and
it
was
easy
to
climb
up
for
the
big
stones
had
rough
edges
and
so
did
not
fit
very
closely
and
there
was
room
for
a
toe
here
and
a
hand
there
in
a
minute
or
two
they
were
all
up
but
they
could
not
see
down
on
the
other
side
because
the
wall
was
about
eight
feet
thick
they
walked
toward
the
other
edge
and
still
they
could
not
see
down
quite
close
to
the
edge
and
still
no
seeing
it
isn
t
sky
at
all
said
bernard
suddenly
it
s
a
sort
of
i
shouldn
t
wonder
painted
to
look
like
it
can
t
be
said
someone
it
is
though
said
bernard
there
couldn
t
be
one
so
big
said
someone
else
but
there
said
bernard
and
then
will
not
tell
you
out
a
hand
and
quite
forgetting
the
princess
s
warning
touched
the
sky
that
hand
felt
something
as
faint
and
thin
as
a
instantly
this
something
broke
and
the
sea
came
pouring
into
the
s
country
now
you
ve
done
it
said
one
of
those
whose
hand
it
wasn
t
and
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
person
who
owned
the
hand
done
done
it
very
thoroughly
it
was
plain
enough
now
that
what
they
had
been
living
in
was
not
water
and
that
this
was
the
first
rush
of
it
was
in
less
than
a
moment
the
whole
kingdom
was
flooded
and
then
the
water
became
clear
and
quiet
the
children
found
no
difficulty
in
breathing
and
it
was
as
easy
to
walk
as
it
is
on
land
in
a
high
wind
they
could
not
run
but
they
walked
as
fast
as
they
could
to
the
place
where
they
had
left
the
princess
pouring
out
the
water
for
all
the
rivers
in
all
the
world
and
as
they
went
one
of
them
said
oh
don
t
don
t
tell
it
was
me
you
don
t
know
what
punishments
they
may
have
the
others
said
of
course
they
wouldn
t
tell
but
the
one
who
had
touched
the
sky
felt
that
it
was
despised
and
disgraced
they
found
the
pedestal
but
what
had
been
the
pool
was
only
part
of
the
enormous
sea
and
so
was
the
little
marble
channel
the
princess
was
not
there
and
they
began
to
look
for
her
more
and
more
anxious
and
wretched
it
s
all
your
fault
said
francis
to
the
guilty
one
who
had
broken
the
sky
by
touching
it
and
bernard
said
you
shut
up
can
t
you
it
was
a
long
time
before
they
found
their
princess
and
when
they
did
find
her
they
hardly
knew
her
she
came
swimming
toward
them
and
she
was
wearing
her
tail
and
a
cuirass
and
helmet
of
the
most
beautiful
scales
of
it
overlapping
and
the
crest
on
her
helmet
was
one
great
pearl
as
big
as
a
billiard
ball
she
carried
something
over
her
arm
here
you
are
she
said
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
the
future
is
full
of
danger
the
water
has
got
yes
we
noticed
that
said
bernard
and
mavis
said
please
it
was
us
we
touched
the
will
they
punish
us
asked
cathay
there
are
no
punishments
here
said
the
pearly
princess
gravely
only
the
consequences
of
your
action
our
great
defense
against
the
under
folk
is
that
thin
blue
dome
which
you
have
broken
it
can
only
be
broken
from
the
inside
our
enemies
were
powerless
to
destroy
it
but
now
they
may
attack
us
at
any
moment
i
am
going
to
command
my
troops
will
you
come
too
rather
said
reuben
and
the
others
somewhat
less
cordially
agreed
they
cheered
up
a
little
when
the
princess
went
on
it
s
the
only
way
to
make
you
safe
there
are
four
posts
vacant
on
my
staff
and
i
have
brought
you
the
uniforms
that
go
with
the
she
unfolded
five
tails
and
four
little
pearly
coats
like
her
own
with
round
pearls
for
buttons
pearls
as
big
as
marbles
put
these
on
quickly
she
said
they
are
enchanted
coats
given
by
neptune
himself
to
an
ancestor
of
ours
by
pressing
the
third
button
from
the
top
you
can
render
yourself
invisible
the
third
button
below
that
will
make
you
visible
again
when
you
wish
it
and
the
last
button
of
all
will
enable
you
to
become
intangible
as
well
as
intangible
said
cathay
unfeelable
so
you
re
quite
but
there
are
only
four
coats
said
francis
that
is
so
said
the
princess
one
of
you
will
have
to
take
its
chance
with
the
boy
scouts
which
is
it
to
be
each
of
the
children
always
said
and
thought
that
it
meant
to
say
i
will
but
somehow
or
other
the
person
who
spoke
first
was
reuben
the
instant
the
princess
had
said
be
reuben
shouted
me
adding
however
almost
at
once
right
said
the
princess
kindly
off
with
you
the
sea
urchins
barracks
are
behind
that
rock
off
with
you
here
don
t
forget
your
tail
it
enables
you
to
be
as
comfortable
in
the
water
as
any
reuben
took
the
tail
and
hastened
away
now
said
the
princess
and
they
all
began
putting
on
their
tails
it
was
like
putting
both
your
feet
into
a
very
large
stocking
then
came
the
mail
coats
don
t
we
have
swords
francis
asked
looking
down
at
his
slim
and
silvery
extremity
swords
in
the
crustacean
brigade
never
forget
children
that
you
belong
to
the
princess
s
own
oysters
here
are
your
she
pointed
to
a
heap
of
large
oyster
shells
as
big
as
roman
shields
see
she
said
you
hold
them
this
way
as
a
rule
a
very
powerful
spring
is
released
when
you
hold
them
but
what
do
you
do
with
it
mavis
asked
nip
the
feet
of
the
enemy
said
the
princess
and
it
holds
on
under
folk
have
no
tails
you
wait
till
they
are
near
a
rock
then
nip
a
s
foot
with
your
good
weapon
laying
the
other
end
on
the
rock
the
oyster
shell
will
at
once
attach
itself
to
the
rock
and
a
terrible
shout
rang
out
and
the
princess
stopped
what
is
it
oh
what
is
it
said
the
children
and
the
princess
shuddered
again
that
most
terrible
sound
the
children
had
ever
heard
what
is
it
they
said
again
the
princess
drew
herself
up
as
if
ashamed
of
her
momentary
weakness
and
said
it
is
the
war
cry
of
the
under
chapter
eight
after
the
sound
of
that
terrible
shouting
there
came
is
there
was
silence
where
the
children
were
but
all
above
they
could
hear
the
rush
and
rustle
of
a
quick
arming
the
war
cry
of
the
people
of
the
depths
said
the
princess
i
suppose
said
kathleen
forlornly
that
if
they
re
so
near
as
that
all
is
lost
no
indeed
cried
the
princess
the
people
of
the
depths
are
very
strong
but
they
are
very
heavy
they
can
not
rise
up
and
come
to
us
from
the
water
above
before
they
can
get
in
they
must
scale
the
but
they
will
get
over
the
t
they
not
while
one
of
the
royal
halibuts
still
lives
the
halibuts
have
manned
the
wall
they
will
keep
back
the
foe
but
they
won
t
attack
yet
they
ll
send
out
their
scouts
and
skirmishers
till
they
approach
the
crustacean
brigade
can
do
nothing
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
watch
a
fight
in
which
you
may
not
share
i
must
apologize
for
appointing
you
to
such
an
unsatisfactory
thank
you
don
t
mind
said
cathay
hastily
what
s
that
it
was
a
solid
gleaming
sheet
of
silver
that
rose
above
them
like
a
great
split
and
tore
itself
into
silver
threads
it
is
the
swordfish
brigade
said
the
princess
we
could
swim
up
a
little
and
watch
them
if
you
re
not
afraid
you
see
the
first
attack
will
probably
be
delivered
by
one
of
their
shark
regiments
the
sharks
have
a
horrible
reputation
but
our
brave
swordfish
are
a
match
for
them
she
added
proudly
the
swordfish
who
were
slowly
swimming
to
and
fro
above
seemed
to
stiffen
as
though
to
meet
some
danger
at
present
unseen
by
the
others
then
with
a
swift
silent
terrible
movement
the
sharks
rushed
on
the
noble
defenders
of
merland
the
swordfish
with
their
deadly
weapons
were
next
moment
all
the
water
was
a
wild
whirl
of
confused
conflict
the
sharks
fought
with
a
sort
of
harsh
rough
courage
and
the
children
who
had
drawn
away
to
a
little
distance
could
not
help
admiring
their
desperate
onslaught
but
the
swordfish
were
more
than
their
match
with
more
skill
and
an
equally
desperate
gallantry
they
met
and
repulsed
the
savage
onslaught
of
the
sharks
shoals
of
large
calm
cod
swept
up
from
the
depths
and
began
to
shoulder
the
dead
sharks
sideways
toward
the
water
above
the
dead
sharks
and
alas
many
a
brave
dead
swordfish
too
for
the
victory
had
not
been
a
cheap
one
the
children
could
not
help
cheering
as
the
victorious
swordfish
pursuit
is
unnecessary
said
the
princess
the
sharks
have
lost
too
heavily
to
resume
the
a
shark
in
retreat
passed
close
by
her
and
she
clipped
its
tail
with
her
oyster
shell
the
shark
turned
savagely
but
the
princess
with
one
was
out
of
danger
pushing
the
children
before
her
outspread
arms
and
the
shark
began
to
sink
still
making
vain
efforts
to
pursue
them
illustration
swordfish
the
shell
will
drag
him
down
said
the
princess
and
now
i
must
go
and
get
a
fresh
shield
i
wish
i
knew
where
the
next
attack
would
be
they
sank
slowly
through
the
water
i
wonder
where
reuben
is
said
bernard
oh
he
s
quite
safe
said
the
princess
the
boy
scouts
don
t
go
outside
the
just
do
a
good
turn
for
anybody
who
wants
it
you
help
the
kind
soles
to
look
after
the
they
had
reached
the
great
flooded
garden
again
and
turned
toward
the
palace
and
as
they
went
a
sea
urchin
shell
suddenly
rose
from
behind
one
of
the
clipped
sea
urchin
shell
and
behind
it
a
long
tail
the
shell
was
raised
and
the
face
under
it
was
reuben
s
hi
princess
he
shouted
i
ve
been
looking
for
you
everywhere
we
ve
been
scouting
i
got
a
lot
of
seaweed
and
they
thought
i
was
nothing
seaweed
and
so
i
got
quite
close
to
the
it
was
very
rash
said
the
princess
severely
the
others
don
t
think
so
he
said
a
little
hurt
they
began
by
saying
i
was
only
an
irregular
sea
urchin
because
i
ve
got
this
jolly
tail
gave
it
a
merry
and
they
called
me
spatangus
and
names
like
that
but
they
ve
made
me
their
general
echinus
i
m
a
regular
now
and
no
mistake
and
what
i
was
going
to
say
is
the
enemy
is
going
to
attack
the
north
tower
in
force
in
half
an
you
good
boy
said
the
princess
i
do
believe
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
his
sea
urchin
s
uniform
she
would
have
kissed
him
you
re
splendid
you
re
a
hero
if
you
could
do
it
s
heaps
of
you
find
out
if
there
s
any
danger
from
the
book
people
you
ones
in
the
cave
it
s
always
been
our
fear
that
they
might
attack
and
if
they
i
d
rather
be
the
slave
of
a
shark
than
of
she
gathered
an
armful
of
seaweed
from
the
nearest
tree
and
reuben
wrapped
himself
in
it
and
drifted
less
like
a
live
boy
scout
than
you
could
believe
possible
the
defenders
of
merland
now
acting
on
reuben
s
information
began
to
mass
themselves
near
the
north
wall
now
is
our
time
said
the
princess
we
must
go
along
the
tunnel
and
when
we
hear
the
sound
of
their
heavy
feet
shaking
the
flow
of
ocean
we
must
make
sallies
and
fix
our
shell
shields
in
their
feet
major
rally
your
a
tall
merchild
in
the
crustacean
uniform
blew
a
clear
note
and
the
soldiers
of
the
crustacean
brigade
who
having
nothing
particular
to
do
had
been
helping
anyone
and
everyone
as
best
they
could
which
is
the
way
in
merland
though
not
in
europe
gathered
about
their
officers
when
they
were
all
drawn
up
before
her
the
princess
addressed
her
troops
my
men
she
said
we
have
been
suddenly
plunged
into
war
but
it
has
not
found
us
unprepared
i
am
proud
to
think
that
my
regiments
are
ready
to
the
last
pearl
button
and
i
know
that
every
man
among
you
will
be
as
proud
as
i
am
that
our
post
is
as
tradition
tells
us
it
has
always
been
the
post
of
danger
we
shall
go
out
into
the
depths
of
the
sea
to
fight
the
enemies
of
our
dear
country
and
to
lay
down
our
lives
if
need
be
for
that
country
s
the
soldiers
answered
by
cheers
and
the
princess
led
the
way
to
one
of
those
little
buildings
like
temples
of
flora
in
old
pictures
which
the
children
had
noticed
in
the
gardens
at
the
order
given
a
sergeant
raised
a
great
stone
by
a
golden
ring
embedded
in
it
and
disclosed
a
dark
passage
leading
underground
a
splendid
captain
of
cockles
six
feet
high
if
he
was
an
inch
with
a
sergeant
and
six
men
led
the
way
three
oyster
officers
followed
then
a
company
of
oysters
the
advance
guard
at
the
head
of
the
main
body
following
were
the
princess
and
her
staff
as
they
went
the
princess
explained
why
the
tunnel
was
so
long
and
sloped
so
steeply
you
see
she
said
the
inside
of
our
wall
is
only
about
ten
feet
high
but
it
goes
down
on
the
other
side
for
forty
feet
or
more
it
is
built
on
a
hill
now
i
don
t
want
you
to
feel
obliged
to
come
out
and
fight
you
can
stay
inside
and
get
the
shields
ready
for
us
to
take
we
shall
keep
on
rushing
back
for
fresh
weapons
of
course
the
tunnel
s
much
too
narrow
for
the
under
folk
to
get
in
but
they
have
their
regiment
of
highly
trained
sea
serpents
who
of
course
can
make
themselves
thin
and
worm
through
cathay
doesn
t
like
serpents
said
mavis
anxiously
you
needn
t
be
afraid
said
the
princess
they
re
dreadful
cowards
they
know
the
passage
is
guarded
by
our
lobsters
they
won
t
come
within
a
mile
of
the
entrance
but
the
main
body
of
the
enemy
will
have
to
pass
quite
close
there
s
a
great
sea
mountain
and
the
only
way
to
our
north
tower
is
in
the
narrow
ravine
between
that
mountain
and
the
tunnel
ended
in
a
large
rocky
hall
with
the
armory
hung
with
ten
thousand
gleaming
shields
on
the
one
side
and
the
guardroom
crowded
with
enthusiastic
lobsters
on
the
other
the
entrance
from
the
sea
was
a
short
narrow
passage
in
which
stood
two
lobsters
in
their
beautiful
dark
coats
of
mail
since
the
moment
when
the
blue
sky
that
looked
first
so
like
sky
and
then
so
like
painted
tin
had
touched
confessed
itself
to
be
a
too
in
the
most
practical
way
by
bursting
and
letting
the
water
into
children
had
been
carried
along
by
the
breathless
rush
of
preparations
for
the
invasion
and
the
world
they
were
now
in
had
rapidly
increased
in
reality
while
their
own
world
in
which
till
today
they
had
always
lived
had
been
losing
reality
at
exactly
the
same
rate
as
that
by
which
the
new
world
gained
it
so
it
was
that
when
the
princess
said
you
needn
t
go
out
and
attack
the
enemy
unless
you
like
they
all
answered
in
some
astonishment
but
we
that
s
all
right
said
the
princess
i
only
wanted
to
see
if
they
were
in
working
if
what
were
your
coats
they
re
coats
of
valor
of
i
think
i
could
be
brave
without
a
coat
said
bernard
and
began
to
undo
his
pearl
buttons
of
course
you
could
said
the
princess
in
fact
you
must
be
brave
to
begin
with
or
the
coat
couldn
t
work
it
would
be
no
good
to
a
coward
it
just
keeps
your
natural
valor
warm
and
your
wits
it
makes
you
braver
said
kathleen
suddenly
at
least
i
hope
it
s
i
expect
it
s
the
coat
anyhow
i
m
glad
it
does
because
i
do
want
to
be
brave
oh
princess
well
said
the
princess
gravely
but
not
unkindly
what
is
it
kathleen
stood
a
moment
her
hands
twisting
in
each
other
and
her
eyes
downcast
then
in
an
instant
she
had
unbuttoned
and
pulled
off
her
coat
of
pearly
mail
and
thrown
it
at
the
princess
s
feet
i
ll
do
it
without
the
coat
she
said
and
drew
a
long
breath
the
others
looked
on
in
silence
longing
to
help
her
but
knowing
that
no
one
could
help
her
now
but
herself
it
was
me
said
kathleen
suddenly
and
let
go
a
deep
breath
of
relief
it
was
me
that
touched
the
sky
and
let
in
the
water
and
i
am
most
frightfully
sorry
and
i
know
you
ll
never
forgive
me
quick
said
the
princess
picking
up
the
coat
get
into
your
armor
it
ll
prevent
your
she
hustled
kathleen
into
the
coat
and
kept
her
arms
around
her
brave
girl
she
whispered
i
m
glad
you
did
it
without
the
the
other
three
thought
it
polite
to
turn
away
of
course
the
princess
added
i
you
didn
t
know
i
how
did
you
know
said
kathleen
by
your
eyes
said
the
princess
with
one
last
hug
they
re
quite
different
now
come
let
us
go
to
the
gate
and
see
if
any
of
our
scouts
are
the
two
lobster
sentries
presented
claws
as
the
princess
passed
with
her
staff
through
the
narrow
arch
and
onto
the
sandy
plain
of
the
sea
bottom
the
children
were
astonished
to
find
that
they
could
see
quite
plain
a
long
way
through
the
far
as
they
could
have
seen
in
air
and
the
view
was
very
like
one
kind
of
land
view
first
the
smooth
flat
sand
dotted
with
copses
of
branching
woods
of
taller
treelike
weeds
with
rocks
shelving
up
and
up
to
a
tall
rocky
mountain
this
mountain
sent
out
a
spur
then
ran
along
beside
the
merkingdom
and
joined
the
rock
behind
it
and
it
was
along
the
narrow
gorge
so
formed
that
the
under
folk
were
expected
to
advance
there
were
balls
of
seaweed
floating
in
the
least
it
really
now
had
grown
to
seem
like
air
though
of
course
it
was
no
signs
of
scouts
suddenly
the
balls
of
seaweed
drew
together
and
the
princess
murmured
i
thought
so
as
they
formed
into
orderly
lines
sank
to
the
ground
and
remained
motionless
for
a
moment
while
one
ball
of
seaweed
stood
in
front
of
them
it
s
the
boy
scouts
she
said
your
reuben
is
giving
them
their
it
seemed
that
she
was
right
for
next
moment
the
balls
of
seaweed
drifted
away
in
different
directions
and
the
one
who
had
stood
before
them
drifted
straight
to
the
arch
where
the
princess
and
the
children
stood
it
drifted
in
pulled
off
its
seaweed
disguise
and
was
in
effect
reuben
we
ve
found
out
something
more
your
highness
he
said
saluting
the
princess
the
vanguard
are
to
be
sea
horses
you
know
not
the
little
ones
but
the
great
things
they
have
in
the
no
use
our
attacking
the
horses
said
the
princess
they
re
as
hard
as
ice
who
rides
them
the
first
dipsys
said
reuben
they
re
the
young
under
folk
who
want
to
cut
a
dash
they
call
them
the
forlorn
hopers
for
have
they
got
armor
s
their
swank
they
ve
no
armor
but
their
natural
scales
those
look
thick
enough
though
i
say
princess
i
suppose
we
sea
urchins
are
free
to
do
exactly
as
we
choose
yes
said
the
princess
unless
orders
are
well
idea
is
that
the
lobsters
are
the
fellows
to
tackle
the
sea
horses
hold
on
to
their
tails
see
they
can
t
hurt
the
lobsters
because
they
can
t
get
at
their
own
but
when
the
lobsters
let
go
said
the
princess
the
lobsters
wouldn
t
let
go
till
they
had
driven
back
the
enemy
said
the
lobster
captain
saluting
your
highness
may
i
ask
if
you
propose
to
take
this
urchin
s
advice
isn
t
it
good
she
asked
yes
your
highness
the
lobster
captain
answered
but
it
s
illustration
first
i
am
the
best
judge
of
that
said
the
princess
gently
remember
that
these
are
noble
volunteers
who
are
fighting
for
us
of
their
own
free
the
lobster
saluted
and
was
silent
i
can
not
send
the
lobsters
said
the
princess
we
need
them
to
protect
the
gate
but
the
ah
highness
let
us
go
pleaded
the
lobster
captain
the
crabs
can
not
keep
the
gate
said
the
princess
kindly
you
know
they
are
not
narrow
enough
francis
will
you
be
my
and
take
a
message
to
the
queen
may
i
go
too
asked
mavis
yes
but
we
must
deliver
a
double
assault
if
the
crabs
attack
the
horses
who
will
deal
with
the
riders
i
have
an
idea
about
that
too
said
reuben
if
we
could
have
some
good
heavy
shoving
someone
sharp
to
finish
them
off
the
swordfish
perhaps
you
are
a
born
general
the
princess
said
but
you
don
t
quite
know
our
resources
the
united
narwhals
can
do
the
shoving
as
you
call
their
horns
are
sharp
and
heavy
now
took
a
smooth
white
chalkstone
from
the
seafloor
and
a
ready
lobster
brought
her
a
sharpened
haddock
bone
she
wrote
quickly
scratching
the
letters
deep
on
the
chalk
here
she
said
take
this
to
the
queen
you
will
find
her
at
headquarters
at
the
palace
yard
tell
her
everything
i
have
only
asked
for
the
two
regiments
you
must
explain
the
rest
i
don
t
suppose
there
ll
be
any
difficulty
in
getting
through
our
lines
but
if
there
should
be
the
password
is
glory
and
the
countersign
is
or
and
hurry
hurry
hurry
for
your
lives
never
before
had
mavis
and
francis
felt
anything
like
the
glow
of
excitement
and
importance
which
warmed
them
as
they
went
up
the
long
tunnel
to
take
the
message
to
the
queen
but
where
is
the
palace
mavis
said
and
they
stopped
looking
at
each
other
i
ll
show
you
please
said
a
little
voice
behind
them
they
turned
quickly
to
find
a
small
spruce
gentlemanly
mackerel
at
their
heels
i
m
one
of
the
guides
it
said
i
felt
sure
you
d
need
me
this
way
sir
please
and
it
led
the
way
across
the
gardens
in
and
out
of
the
clumps
of
trees
and
between
the
seaweed
hedges
till
they
came
to
the
palace
rows
and
rows
of
soldiers
surrounded
it
all
waiting
impatiently
for
the
word
of
command
that
should
send
them
to
meet
the
enemies
of
their
country
glory
said
the
gentlemanly
mackerel
as
he
passed
the
outposts
or
death
replied
the
sentinel
sea
bream
the
queen
was
in
the
courtyard
in
which
the
children
had
received
their
short
a
time
ago
and
yet
how
long
it
seemed
then
the
courtyard
had
been
a
scene
of
the
calm
and
charming
gaiety
of
a
nation
at
peace
now
it
was
full
of
the
ardent
intense
inactivity
of
waiting
warriors
the
queen
in
her
gleaming
coral
armor
met
them
as
the
password
opened
a
way
to
her
through
the
ranks
of
the
soldiers
she
took
the
stone
and
read
it
and
with
true
royal
kindness
she
found
time
even
at
such
a
moment
for
a
word
of
thanks
to
the
messengers
see
the
narwhals
start
she
added
and
then
back
to
your
posts
with
all
speed
tell
your
commanding
officer
that
so
far
the
book
people
have
made
no
sign
but
the
golden
gate
is
strongly
defended
by
the
king
s
own
cod
i
didn
t
know
there
was
a
king
said
francis
the
queen
looked
stern
and
the
mackerel
guide
jerked
francis
s
magic
coattail
warningly
and
whispered
hush
the
king
said
the
queen
quietly
is
no
more
he
was
lost
at
when
the
splendid
steady
column
of
narwhals
had
marched
off
to
its
appointed
place
the
children
bowed
to
the
queen
and
went
back
to
their
posts
i
m
sorry
i
said
anything
said
francis
to
the
mackerel
but
i
didn
t
know
besides
how
can
a
be
lost
at
sea
aren
t
your
kings
lost
on
land
asked
the
mackerel
or
if
not
kings
men
quite
as
good
what
about
explorers
i
see
said
mavis
and
doesn
t
anyone
know
what
has
become
of
him
no
said
the
mackerel
he
has
been
lost
for
a
very
long
time
we
fear
the
worst
if
he
were
alive
he
would
have
come
back
we
think
the
under
folk
have
him
they
bewitch
prisoners
so
that
they
forget
who
they
are
of
course
there
s
the
antidote
every
uniform
is
made
with
a
little
antidote
pocket
just
over
the
he
put
his
fin
inside
his
scales
and
produced
a
little
golden
case
just
like
a
skate
s
egg
you
ve
got
them
too
of
course
he
added
if
you
are
taken
prisoner
swallow
the
contents
at
but
if
you
forget
who
you
are
said
francis
don
t
you
forget
the
antidote
no
charm
the
mackerel
assured
him
is
strong
enough
to
make
one
forget
one
s
and
now
they
were
back
at
the
gate
the
princess
ran
to
meet
them
what
a
time
you
ve
been
she
said
is
all
well
have
the
narwhals
taken
up
their
position
satisfied
on
this
point
she
led
the
children
up
a
way
long
and
steep
to
a
window
in
the
wall
whence
they
could
look
down
on
the
ravine
and
see
the
advance
of
the
foe
the
narwhals
were
halted
about
halfway
up
the
ravine
where
it
widened
to
a
sort
of
amphitheater
here
among
the
rocks
they
lay
in
ambush
waiting
for
the
advance
of
the
foe
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
reuben
said
the
princess
as
they
leaned
their
elbows
on
the
broad
rocky
ledge
of
the
window
they
might
easily
have
stormed
the
north
should
not
have
been
our
strongest
defenses
were
massed
on
the
south
side
it
was
there
they
attacked
last
time
so
the
history
books
tell
and
now
a
heavy
thundering
sound
faint
yet
terrible
announced
the
approach
of
the
far
away
across
the
sea
plain
something
could
be
seen
moving
a
ball
of
seaweed
seemed
to
drift
up
the
ravine
a
sea
urchin
gone
to
give
the
alarm
said
the
princess
what
splendid
things
boy
scouts
are
we
didn
t
have
them
in
the
last
war
my
dear
father
only
invented
them
just
she
paused
and
sighed
look
she
said
the
enemy
s
heavy
cavalry
were
moving
in
a
solid
mass
toward
great
sea
horses
twenty
feet
long
and
their
great
riders
who
must
have
been
eight
or
ten
feet
high
came
more
and
more
quickly
heading
to
the
ravine
the
riders
were
the
most
terrible
beings
the
children
had
ever
seen
clothed
from
head
to
feet
in
closely
fitting
scales
with
large
heads
large
ears
large
mouths
and
blunt
noses
and
large
eyes
they
sat
each
erect
on
his
armored
steed
the
long
harpoons
swaying
lightly
in
their
enormous
hands
the
sea
horses
quickened
their
a
noise
like
a
hoarse
trumpet
rang
out
they
are
sounding
the
charge
said
the
princess
and
as
she
spoke
the
under
folk
charged
at
the
ravine
in
a
determined
furious
onrush
oh
no
one
can
stand
up
against
can
t
said
cathay
in
despair
from
the
window
they
could
see
right
down
onto
the
amphitheater
where
the
narwhals
were
concealed
on
came
the
sea
far
as
they
neared
the
ambush
bunches
of
seaweed
drifted
in
the
faces
of
the
riders
they
floundered
and
strove
to
push
away
the
clinging
as
they
strove
the
narwhals
made
their
their
weight
against
the
riders
and
hurled
them
from
their
horses
and
from
the
covers
of
the
rocks
the
crabs
advanced
with
an
incredible
speed
and
caught
the
tails
of
the
sea
horses
in
their
inexorable
claws
the
riders
lay
on
the
ground
the
horses
were
rearing
and
prancing
with
fear
and
pain
as
the
clouds
of
seaweed
each
with
a
prickly
sea
urchin
in
it
flung
themselves
against
their
faces
the
riders
stood
up
fighting
to
the
last
but
the
harpoons
were
no
match
for
the
narwhal
s
horns
come
away
said
the
princess
already
the
sea
horses
urged
by
the
enormous
crabs
were
retreating
in
the
wildest
disorder
pursued
by
narwhals
and
harassed
by
sea
urchins
the
princess
and
the
children
went
back
to
the
lobster
sentries
repulsed
said
the
princess
with
heavy
loss
the
lobsters
cheered
how
s
that
princess
said
a
ball
of
seaweed
uncurling
itself
at
the
gate
and
presenting
the
familiar
features
of
reuben
how
is
it
she
said
it
is
victory
and
we
owe
it
to
you
but
you
re
wounded
only
a
scratch
said
reuben
harpoon
just
missed
oh
reuben
you
are
a
hero
said
cathay
get
along
you
silly
he
answered
gracefully
chapter
nine
book
even
in
the
midst
of
war
there
are
intervals
for
refreshments
our
own
soldiers
no
matter
how
fierce
must
eat
to
live
and
the
same
is
the
case
with
the
submarine
regiments
the
crustacean
brigade
took
advantage
of
the
lull
in
hostilities
which
followed
the
defeat
of
the
sea
horses
to
march
back
to
the
palace
and
have
a
meal
a
very
plain
meal
it
was
too
and
very
different
from
the
banquet
of
ovations
as
cathay
pointed
out
afterward
there
were
no
prettily
spread
tables
decorated
with
bunches
of
seaweed
no
plates
or
knives
or
forks
the
food
was
passed
around
by
hand
and
there
was
one
drinking
horn
a
sea
cow
s
horn
to
every
six
soldiers
they
all
sat
on
the
ground
as
you
do
at
a
picnic
and
the
queen
came
and
spoke
a
few
hurried
words
to
them
when
on
her
way
to
strengthen
the
defenses
of
the
golden
gate
and
as
i
said
the
food
was
plain
however
everyone
had
enough
to
eat
which
was
the
main
thing
baskets
of
provisions
were
sent
down
to
the
lobsters
guardroom
it
is
important
said
princess
freia
that
our
men
should
be
on
the
spot
in
case
they
are
needed
and
the
same
with
the
dinner
i
shall
go
down
with
the
provisions
and
keep
their
hearts
yes
dear
do
said
the
princess
maia
but
don
t
do
anything
rash
no
sorties
now
you
lobsters
are
so
terribly
brave
but
you
know
mother
said
you
weren
t
to
ah
me
war
is
a
terrible
thing
what
a
state
the
rivers
will
get
into
with
all
this
water
going
on
and
the
winds
all
loose
and
doing
as
they
like
it
s
horrible
to
think
about
it
will
take
ages
to
get
things
straight
her
fears
were
only
too
well
founded
all
this
happened
last
you
know
what
a
wet
summer
that
was
i
know
dear
said
freia
but
i
know
now
who
broke
the
sky
and
it
is
very
very
we
won
t
rub
it
in
will
we
i
didn
t
mean
to
said
maia
smiling
kindly
at
the
children
and
went
off
to
encourage
her
lobsters
and
now
said
francis
when
the
meal
was
over
what
are
we
going
to
do
next
we
can
t
do
anything
but
wait
for
news
said
the
princess
our
scouts
will
let
us
know
soon
enough
i
only
hope
the
book
people
won
t
attack
us
at
the
same
time
as
the
under
folk
that
s
always
the
how
could
they
get
in
mavis
asked
through
the
golden
door
said
the
princess
of
course
they
couldn
t
do
anything
if
we
hadn
t
read
the
books
they
re
in
that
s
the
worst
of
education
we
ve
all
read
such
an
awful
lot
and
that
unlocks
the
books
and
they
can
come
out
if
anyone
calls
them
even
our
fish
are
intolerably
well
the
porpoises
dear
things
who
never
could
read
anything
that
s
why
the
golden
door
is
guarded
by
them
of
if
not
having
read
things
is
useful
said
mavis
we
ve
read
almost
nothing
couldn
t
we
help
guard
the
door
the
very
thing
said
the
princess
joyously
for
you
possess
the
only
weapon
that
can
be
used
against
these
people
or
against
the
authors
who
created
them
if
you
can
truthfully
say
to
them
i
never
heard
of
you
your
words
become
a
deadly
sword
that
strikes
at
their
most
sensitive
what
spot
asked
bernard
and
the
princess
answered
their
so
the
little
party
went
toward
the
golden
door
and
found
it
behind
a
thick
wall
of
porpoises
incessant
cries
came
from
beyond
the
gates
and
to
every
cry
they
answered
like
one
porpoise
we
never
heard
of
you
you
can
t
come
in
you
can
t
come
in
we
never
heard
of
we
shan
t
be
any
good
here
said
bernard
among
the
thick
rich
voices
of
the
porpoises
they
can
keep
anyone
yes
said
the
princess
but
if
the
book
folk
look
through
the
gate
and
see
that
they
re
only
porpoises
their
wounded
vanity
will
heal
and
they
ll
come
on
as
strongly
as
ever
whereas
if
they
did
find
human
beings
who
have
never
heard
of
them
the
wounds
ought
to
be
mortal
as
long
as
you
are
able
truthfully
to
say
that
you
don
t
know
them
they
can
t
get
reuben
would
be
the
person
for
this
said
francis
i
don
t
believe
he
s
read
well
we
haven
t
read
much
said
cathay
comfortably
at
least
not
about
nasty
i
wish
i
hadn
t
sighed
the
princess
through
the
noise
of
the
voices
outside
the
gate
i
know
them
all
you
hear
that
cold
squeak
that
s
fairchild
and
that
short
sharp
barking
s
aunt
fortune
the
sort
of
growl
that
goes
on
all
the
time
is
murdstone
and
that
icy
voice
is
rosamund
s
one
who
was
so
hateful
about
the
purple
i
m
afraid
we
know
some
of
those
said
mavis
then
be
careful
not
to
say
you
don
t
there
are
heaps
you
don
t
knox
and
machiavelli
and
don
diego
and
tippoo
sahib
and
sally
brass
go
back
if
anything
should
happen
fling
your
arms
round
the
nearest
porpoise
and
trust
to
luck
these
book
people
can
t
can
only
but
how
do
you
know
them
all
mavis
asked
do
they
often
attack
you
no
only
when
the
sky
falls
but
they
always
howl
outside
the
gate
at
the
full
so
saying
she
turned
away
and
disappeared
in
the
crowd
of
faithful
porpoises
and
outside
the
noise
grew
louder
and
the
words
more
definite
i
am
randolph
let
me
in
i
am
good
brown
let
me
in
i
am
eric
or
little
by
little
i
come
in
i
am
elsie
or
like
a
little
candle
let
me
me
in
i
am
i
am
i
am
uriah
i
am
i
am
king
i
am
i
am
the
giant
i
am
the
dragon
of
and
they
all
cried
again
and
again
let
us
in
let
me
in
let
me
in
the
strain
of
listening
for
the
names
and
calling
out
i
don
t
know
you
when
they
didn
t
and
saying
nothing
when
they
did
became
almost
unbearable
it
was
like
that
horrid
game
with
the
corners
of
the
handkerchief
hold
fast
and
let
loose
and
you
have
to
remember
to
do
the
opposite
sooner
or
later
an
accident
is
bound
to
happen
and
the
children
felt
a
growing
conviction
that
it
would
be
sooner
what
will
happen
if
they
do
get
in
cathay
asked
a
neighboring
porpoise
can
t
say
miss
i
m
sure
it
answered
but
what
will
you
do
obstruct
them
in
the
execution
of
our
duty
it
answered
you
see
miss
they
can
t
kill
they
can
only
stupefy
and
they
can
t
stupefy
us
cause
why
we
re
that
stupid
already
we
can
t
hold
no
more
that
s
why
they
trust
us
to
defend
the
golden
gate
it
added
proudly
the
babel
of
voices
outside
grew
louder
and
thicker
and
the
task
of
knowing
when
to
say
i
don
t
know
you
and
so
wound
the
vanity
of
the
invaders
grew
more
and
more
difficult
at
last
the
disaster
foreseen
for
some
time
with
a
growing
plainness
came
upon
them
i
am
the
great
seal
said
a
thick
furry
voice
i
don
t
know
you
cried
cathay
you
s
in
history
james
the
second
dropped
him
in
the
thames
said
francis
yes
you
ve
done
it
shut
up
said
bernard
the
last
two
remarks
were
made
in
a
deep
silence
broken
only
by
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
porpoises
the
voices
behind
the
golden
gate
had
died
down
and
ceased
the
porpoises
massed
their
heavy
bulk
close
to
the
door
remember
the
porpoises
said
francis
don
t
forget
to
hold
on
to
a
four
of
these
amiable
if
unintellectual
creatures
drew
away
from
their
companions
and
one
came
to
the
side
of
each
child
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
golden
door
and
then
slowly
the
door
began
to
open
as
it
opened
it
revealed
the
crowd
that
stood
faces
stupid
faces
crafty
faces
sullen
faces
angry
faces
not
a
single
face
that
you
ever
could
wish
to
see
again
then
slowly
terribly
without
words
the
close
ranks
of
the
book
people
advanced
fairchild
markham
and
barbauld
led
the
van
closely
following
came
the
dragon
of
wantley
the
minotaur
and
the
little
man
that
sintram
knew
then
came
murdstone
neat
in
a
folded
white
neckcloth
and
clothes
as
black
as
his
whiskers
miss
murdstone
was
with
him
every
bead
of
her
alight
with
gratified
malice
the
children
found
that
they
knew
without
being
told
the
name
of
each
foe
now
advancing
on
them
paralyzed
with
terror
they
watched
the
slow
and
terrible
advance
it
was
not
till
eric
or
little
by
little
broke
the
silence
with
a
whoop
of
joy
and
rushed
upon
them
that
they
remembered
their
own
danger
and
clutched
the
waiting
porpoises
alas
it
was
too
late
markham
had
turned
a
frozen
glare
upon
them
fairchild
had
wagged
an
admonitory
forefinger
wave
on
wave
of
sheer
stupidity
swept
over
them
and
next
moment
they
lost
consciousness
and
sank
each
with
his
faithful
porpoise
into
the
dreamless
sleep
of
the
entirely
unintelligent
in
vain
the
main
body
of
the
porpoises
hurled
themselves
against
the
intruders
their
heroism
was
fruitless
overwhelmed
by
the
heavy
truisms
wielded
by
the
enemy
they
turned
and
fled
in
disorder
and
the
conquering
army
entered
merland
francis
was
the
first
to
recover
consciousness
the
porpoise
to
which
he
had
clung
was
fanning
him
with
its
fin
and
imploring
him
for
its
sake
to
look
up
to
speak
all
right
old
chap
said
francis
i
must
have
fallen
asleep
where
are
the
others
they
were
all
there
and
the
devoted
porpoises
quickly
restored
them
to
consciousness
illustration
the
four
children
stood
up
and
looked
at
each
other
i
wish
reuben
was
here
said
cathay
he
d
know
what
to
he
wouldn
t
know
any
more
than
we
do
said
francis
haughtily
we
do
said
mavis
it
s
our
fault
it
s
mine
said
cathay
but
i
couldn
t
help
if
you
hadn
t
one
of
us
would
have
said
bernard
seeking
to
console
i
say
why
do
only
the
nasty
people
come
out
of
the
books
know
that
said
his
porpoise
turning
his
black
face
eagerly
toward
them
the
stupidest
people
can
t
help
knowing
something
the
under
folk
get
in
and
open
the
least
they
send
the
bookworms
in
to
open
them
and
of
course
they
only
open
the
pages
where
the
enemies
are
said
bernard
looking
at
the
golden
gate
which
swung
open
its
lock
hanging
broken
and
useless
yes
said
mavis
we
could
couldn
t
we
open
the
other
books
we
mean
she
appealed
to
her
porpoise
yes
it
said
perhaps
you
could
human
children
can
open
books
i
believe
porpoises
can
t
and
can
t
open
the
books
in
the
cave
of
learning
though
they
can
unlock
them
if
they
want
to
open
them
they
have
to
get
them
from
the
public
mer
libraries
i
can
t
help
knowing
that
it
added
the
porpoises
seemed
really
ashamed
of
not
being
thoroughly
stupid
come
on
said
francis
we
ll
raise
an
army
to
fight
these
book
people
here
s
something
we
can
do
that
you
shut
up
said
bernard
and
thumping
cathay
on
the
back
told
her
to
never
mind
they
went
toward
the
golden
gate
i
suppose
all
the
nasty
people
are
out
of
the
books
by
now
mavis
asked
her
porpoise
who
followed
her
with
the
close
fidelity
of
an
affectionate
little
dog
don
t
know
it
said
with
some
pride
i
m
stupid
i
am
but
i
can
t
help
knowing
that
no
one
can
come
out
of
books
unless
they
re
called
you
ve
just
got
to
tap
on
the
back
of
the
book
and
call
the
name
and
then
you
open
it
and
the
person
comes
out
at
least
that
s
what
the
bookworms
do
and
i
don
t
see
why
you
should
be
what
different
it
soon
appeared
was
the
water
in
the
stream
in
the
cave
of
learning
which
was
quite
plainly
still
water
in
some
other
sense
than
that
in
which
what
they
were
in
was
water
that
is
they
could
not
walk
in
it
they
had
to
swim
the
cave
seemed
dark
but
enough
light
came
from
the
golden
gate
to
enable
them
to
read
the
titles
of
the
books
when
they
had
pulled
away
the
seaweed
which
covered
many
of
them
they
had
to
hold
on
to
the
were
one
hand
and
clear
away
the
seaweed
with
the
other
you
can
guess
the
sort
of
books
at
which
they
and
shakespeare
and
marryat
and
dickens
miss
alcott
and
ewing
hans
andersen
and
stevenson
and
mayne
when
they
had
knocked
they
called
the
name
of
the
hero
whose
help
they
desired
and
will
you
help
us
they
asked
to
conquer
the
horrid
book
people
and
drive
them
back
to
cover
and
not
a
hero
but
said
yes
indeed
we
will
with
all
our
and
they
climbed
down
out
of
the
books
and
swam
up
to
the
golden
gate
and
waited
talking
with
courage
and
dignity
among
themselves
while
the
children
went
on
knocking
at
the
backs
of
are
books
front
calling
out
more
and
more
heroes
to
help
in
the
fight
quentin
durward
and
laurie
were
the
first
to
come
out
then
hereward
and
amyas
and
will
cary
david
copperfield
rob
roy
ivanhoe
caesar
and
anthony
coriolanus
and
othello
but
you
can
make
the
list
for
yourselves
they
came
forth
all
alive
and
splendid
with
valor
and
the
longing
to
strike
once
more
a
blow
for
the
good
cause
as
they
had
been
used
to
do
in
their
old
lives
these
are
enough
said
francis
at
last
we
ought
to
leave
some
in
case
we
want
more
help
you
see
for
yourselves
what
a
splendid
company
it
was
that
swam
to
the
golden
was
no
other
way
than
swimming
except
for
awaited
the
children
and
when
the
children
joined
nervous
at
the
thought
of
the
speeches
they
would
have
to
make
to
their
newly
recruited
found
that
there
was
no
need
of
speeches
the
faithful
porpoises
had
not
been
too
stupid
to
explain
the
simple
facts
of
danger
and
rescue
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
the
children
when
they
marched
toward
the
palace
at
the
head
of
the
band
of
heroes
whom
they
had
pressed
into
the
service
of
the
merland
between
the
clipped
seaweed
hedges
they
went
and
along
the
paths
paved
with
pearl
and
marble
and
so
at
last
drew
near
the
palace
they
gave
the
watchword
or
death
said
the
sentry
and
they
passed
on
to
the
queen
we
ve
brought
a
reinforcement
said
francis
who
had
learned
the
word
from
quentin
durward
as
they
came
along
and
the
queen
gave
one
look
at
her
reinforcement
s
faces
and
said
simply
we
are
the
horrible
book
people
had
not
attacked
the
palace
they
had
gone
furtively
through
the
country
killing
stray
fish
and
destroying
any
beautiful
thing
they
happened
to
find
for
these
people
hate
beauty
and
happiness
they
were
now
holding
a
meeting
in
the
palace
gardens
near
the
fountain
where
the
princesses
had
been
wont
to
do
their
and
they
were
making
speeches
like
mad
you
could
hear
the
dull
flat
murmur
of
them
even
from
the
palace
they
were
the
sort
of
people
who
love
the
sound
of
their
own
silly
voices
the
newcomers
were
ranged
in
orderly
ranks
before
the
queen
awaiting
her
orders
it
looked
like
a
pageant
or
a
parade
there
was
george
in
his
armor
and
joan
of
arc
in
in
plumed
hats
and
laced
shirts
heroes
in
ruffs
and
gentlemen
of
england
gallant
gentlemen
of
france
for
all
the
differences
in
their
dress
there
was
nothing
motley
about
the
band
which
stood
before
the
queen
varied
as
they
were
in
dress
and
feature
they
had
one
quality
in
common
which
marked
them
as
one
company
the
same
light
of
bravery
shone
on
them
all
and
became
them
like
a
fine
uniform
will
you
the
queen
asked
of
their
pale
man
in
the
dress
of
a
will
you
do
just
as
you
think
best
i
would
not
presume
she
added
with
a
kind
of
proud
humility
to
teach
the
game
of
war
to
oh
queen
he
answered
these
brave
men
and
i
will
drive
back
the
intruders
but
having
driven
them
back
we
must
ourselves
return
through
those
dark
doors
which
we
passed
when
your
young
defenders
called
our
names
we
will
drive
back
the
by
the
look
of
them
twill
be
an
easy
task
but
caesar
wars
not
with
women
and
the
women
on
our
side
are
few
though
each
i
doubt
not
has
the
heart
of
a
he
turned
toward
joan
of
arc
with
a
smile
and
she
gave
him
back
a
smile
as
bright
as
the
sword
she
carried
how
many
women
are
there
among
you
the
queen
asked
and
joan
answered
queen
boadicea
and
torfrida
and
i
are
but
but
we
three
cried
torfrida
are
a
match
for
three
hundred
of
such
women
as
those
give
us
but
whips
instead
of
swords
and
we
will
drive
them
like
dogs
to
their
red
and
blue
i
m
afraid
said
the
queen
they
d
overcome
you
by
sheer
weight
you
ve
no
idea
how
heavy
they
and
then
kathleen
covered
herself
with
glory
by
saying
well
but
what
about
amazons
the
very
thing
said
caesar
kindly
would
you
mind
running
back
you
ll
find
them
in
the
third
book
from
the
corner
where
the
large
purple
starfish
is
you
can
t
mistake
the
children
tore
off
to
the
golden
gate
rushed
through
it
and
swam
to
the
spot
where
unmistakably
the
purplish
starfish
spread
its
violet
rays
they
knocked
on
the
book
and
cathay
by
previous
arrangement
called
come
out
please
queen
of
the
amazons
and
bring
all
your
fighting
then
out
came
a
very
splendid
lady
in
glorious
golden
armor
you
d
better
get
some
boats
for
us
she
said
standing
straight
and
splendid
on
a
ledge
of
rock
enough
to
reach
from
here
to
the
gate
or
a
bridge
there
are
all
these
things
in
caesar
s
books
i
m
sure
he
wouldn
t
mind
your
calling
them
out
we
must
not
swim
i
know
because
of
getting
our
bowstrings
so
francis
called
out
a
bridge
and
when
it
was
not
long
enough
to
reach
the
golden
gate
he
called
another
and
then
the
queen
called
her
ladies
and
out
came
a
procession
which
seemed
as
though
it
would
never
end
of
tall
and
beautiful
women
armed
and
equipped
for
war
they
carried
bows
and
the
children
noticed
that
one
side
of
their
chests
was
flatter
than
the
other
and
the
procession
went
on
and
on
passing
along
the
bridge
and
through
the
golden
gate
till
cathay
grew
quite
dizzy
and
at
last
mavis
said
oh
your
majesty
do
stop
them
i
m
sure
there
are
heaps
and
we
shall
be
too
late
if
we
wait
for
any
so
the
queen
stopped
the
procession
and
they
went
back
to
the
palace
where
the
queen
of
the
amazons
greeted
joan
of
arc
and
the
other
ladies
as
though
they
were
old
acquaintances
in
a
few
moments
their
plans
were
laid
i
wish
i
could
describe
to
you
the
great
fight
between
the
nice
book
people
and
the
others
but
i
have
not
time
and
besides
the
children
did
not
see
all
of
it
so
i
don
t
see
why
should
it
was
fought
out
in
the
palace
gardens
the
armies
were
fairly
evenly
matched
as
to
numbers
because
the
bookworms
had
let
out
a
great
many
barbarians
and
these
though
not
so
unpleasant
as
murdstone
and
fairchild
were
quite
bad
enough
the
children
were
not
allowed
to
join
in
the
battle
which
they
would
dearly
have
liked
to
do
only
from
a
safe
distance
they
heard
the
sound
of
steel
on
steel
the
whir
of
arrows
and
the
war
cries
of
the
combatants
and
presently
a
stream
of
fugitives
darkened
the
pearly
pathways
and
one
could
see
the
heroes
with
drawn
swords
following
in
pursuit
and
then
among
those
who
were
left
the
shouts
of
war
turned
suddenly
to
shouts
of
laughter
and
the
merlish
queen
herself
moved
toward
the
battlefield
and
as
she
drew
near
she
too
laughed
for
it
would
seem
the
amazons
had
only
shot
their
arrows
at
the
men
among
their
had
disdained
to
shoot
the
women
and
so
good
was
their
aim
that
not
a
single
woman
was
wounded
only
when
the
book
hatefuls
had
been
driven
back
by
the
book
heroes
the
book
heroines
advanced
and
without
more
ado
fell
on
the
remaining
foes
they
did
not
fight
them
with
swords
or
spears
or
arrows
or
the
short
sharp
knives
they
simply
picked
up
the
screaming
bookwomen
and
carried
them
back
to
the
books
where
they
belonged
each
amazon
caught
up
one
of
the
foe
and
disregarding
her
screaming
and
scratching
carried
her
back
to
the
book
where
she
belonged
pushed
her
in
and
shut
the
door
boadicea
carried
markham
and
her
brown
silk
under
one
bare
braceleted
arm
as
though
she
had
been
a
naughty
child
joan
of
arc
made
herself
responsible
for
aunt
fortune
and
the
queen
of
the
amazons
made
nothing
of
picking
up
miss
murdstone
beads
and
all
and
carrying
her
in
her
arms
like
a
baby
torfrida
s
was
the
hardest
task
she
had
from
the
beginning
singled
out
alftruda
her
old
and
bitter
enemy
and
the
fight
between
them
was
a
fierce
one
though
it
was
but
a
battle
of
looks
yet
before
long
the
fire
in
torfrida
s
great
dark
eyes
seemed
to
scorch
her
adversary
she
shrank
before
it
and
shrank
and
shrank
till
at
last
she
turned
and
crept
back
to
her
book
and
went
in
of
her
own
accord
and
torfrida
shut
the
door
but
said
mavis
who
had
followed
her
don
t
you
live
in
the
same
book
torfrida
smiled
not
quite
she
said
that
would
be
impossible
i
live
in
a
different
edition
where
only
the
nice
people
are
alive
in
hers
it
is
the
nasty
and
where
is
hereward
cathay
asked
before
mavis
could
stop
her
i
do
love
him
don
t
you
yes
said
torfrida
i
love
him
but
he
is
not
alive
in
the
book
where
i
live
but
he
will
will
and
smiling
and
sighing
she
opened
her
book
and
went
into
it
and
the
children
went
slowly
back
to
the
palace
the
fight
was
over
the
book
people
had
gone
back
into
their
books
and
it
was
almost
as
though
they
had
never
left
quite
for
the
children
had
seen
the
faces
of
the
heroes
and
the
books
where
these
lived
could
never
again
now
be
the
same
to
them
all
books
indeed
would
now
have
an
interest
far
above
any
they
had
ever
held
any
of
these
people
might
be
found
in
any
book
you
never
know
illustration
the
princess
freia
met
them
in
the
palace
courtyard
and
clasped
their
hands
and
called
them
the
preservers
of
the
country
which
was
extremely
pleasant
she
also
told
them
that
a
slight
skirmish
had
been
fought
on
the
south
of
the
city
and
the
foe
had
retreated
but
reuben
tells
me
she
that
boy
is
really
worth
his
weight
in
the
main
body
are
to
attack
at
midnight
we
must
sleep
now
to
be
ready
for
the
call
of
duty
when
it
comes
sure
you
understand
your
duties
and
the
power
of
your
buttons
and
your
antidotes
i
might
not
have
time
to
remind
you
later
you
can
sleep
in
the
must
be
awfully
tired
you
ll
be
asleep
before
you
can
say
jack
so
they
lay
down
on
the
seaweed
heaped
along
one
end
of
the
oysters
armory
and
were
instantly
asleep
it
may
have
been
their
natures
or
it
may
have
been
the
influence
of
the
magic
coats
but
whatever
the
cause
it
is
certain
that
they
lay
down
without
fear
slept
without
dreams
and
awoke
without
alarm
when
an
oyster
corporal
touched
their
arms
and
whispered
now
they
were
wide
awake
on
the
instant
and
started
up
picking
their
oyster
shields
from
the
ground
beside
them
i
feel
just
like
a
roman
soldier
cathay
said
don
t
you
and
the
others
owned
that
so
far
as
they
knew
the
feelings
of
a
roman
soldier
those
feelings
were
their
own
the
shadows
of
the
guardroom
were
changed
and
shifted
and
flung
here
and
there
by
the
torches
carried
by
the
busy
oysters
phosphorescent
fish
these
torches
were
and
gave
out
a
moony
light
like
that
of
the
pillars
in
the
cave
of
learning
outside
the
arch
the
water
showed
darkly
clear
large
phosphorescent
fish
were
twined
round
pillars
of
stone
rather
like
the
fish
you
see
on
the
lampposts
on
the
thames
embankment
only
in
this
case
the
fish
were
the
lamps
so
strong
was
the
illumination
that
you
could
see
as
clearly
as
you
can
on
a
moonlit
night
on
the
downs
where
there
are
no
trees
to
steal
the
light
from
the
landscape
and
bury
it
in
their
thick
branches
all
was
hurry
and
bustle
the
salmoners
had
sent
a
detachment
to
harass
the
flank
of
the
enemy
and
the
sea
urchins
under
the
command
of
reuben
were
ready
in
their
seaweed
disguises
there
was
a
waiting
time
and
the
children
used
it
to
practice
with
their
shells
using
the
thick
stems
of
as
a
man
s
represent
the
ankles
of
the
invading
force
and
they
were
soon
fairly
expert
at
the
trick
which
was
their
duty
francis
had
just
nipped
an
extra
fat
stalk
and
released
it
again
by
touching
the
secret
spring
when
the
word
went
around
every
man
to
his
post
the
children
proudly
took
up
their
post
next
to
the
princess
and
hardly
had
they
done
so
when
a
faint
yet
growing
sound
knocked
gently
at
their
ears
it
grew
and
grew
and
grew
till
it
seemed
to
shake
the
ground
on
which
they
stood
and
the
princess
murmured
it
is
the
tramp
of
the
army
of
the
under
folk
now
be
ready
we
shall
lurk
among
these
rocks
hold
your
good
oyster
shell
in
readiness
and
when
you
see
a
foot
near
you
clip
it
and
at
the
same
time
set
down
the
base
of
the
shell
on
the
rock
the
trusty
shell
will
do
the
yes
we
know
thank
you
dear
princess
said
mavis
didn
t
you
see
us
practicing
but
the
princess
was
not
listening
she
had
enough
to
do
to
find
cover
for
her
troops
among
the
rocks
and
now
the
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
the
great
army
sounded
nearer
and
more
near
and
through
the
dimly
lighted
water
the
children
could
see
the
great
deep
sea
people
advancing
very
terrible
they
were
big
beyond
more
stalwart
and
more
finely
knit
than
the
forlorn
hopers
who
had
led
the
attack
so
happily
and
gloriously
frustrated
by
the
crabs
the
narwhals
and
the
sea
urchins
as
the
advance
guard
drew
near
all
the
children
stared
from
their
places
of
concealment
at
the
faces
of
these
terrible
foes
of
the
happy
merland
very
strong
the
faces
were
and
surprisingly
very
very
sad
they
at
least
was
able
to
see
strong
folk
suffering
proudly
an
almost
intolerable
bravely
an
almost
intolerable
pain
but
i
m
on
the
other
side
he
told
himself
to
check
a
sudden
rising
in
his
heart
if
it
was
not
sympathy
what
was
it
and
now
the
head
of
the
advancing
column
was
level
with
the
princess
true
to
the
old
tradition
which
bids
a
commander
lead
and
not
to
follow
his
troops
she
was
the
first
to
dart
out
and
fix
a
shell
to
the
heel
of
the
man
the
children
were
next
their
practice
bore
its
fruit
there
was
no
blunder
no
mistake
each
oyster
shell
clipped
sharp
and
clean
the
attached
ankle
of
an
enemy
each
oyster
shell
at
the
same
moment
attached
itself
firmly
to
the
rock
thus
clinging
to
his
base
in
the
most
thorough
and
military
way
a
spring
of
joy
and
triumph
welled
up
in
the
children
s
hearts
how
easy
it
was
to
get
the
better
of
these
foolish
deep
sea
folk
a
faint
kindly
contempt
floated
into
the
children
s
minds
for
the
who
so
dreaded
and
hated
these
stupid
giants
why
there
were
fifty
or
sixty
of
them
tied
by
the
leg
already
it
was
as
easy
the
pleasant
nature
of
these
reflections
had
kept
our
four
rooted
to
the
spot
in
the
triumphant
performance
of
one
duty
they
failed
to
remember
the
duty
that
should
have
followed
they
stood
there
rejoicing
in
their
victory
when
by
all
the
rules
of
the
service
they
should
have
rushed
back
to
the
armory
for
fresh
weapons
the
omission
was
fatal
even
as
they
stood
there
rejoicing
in
their
cleverness
and
boldness
and
in
the
helpless
anger
of
the
enemy
something
thin
and
spread
itself
around
feet
caught
in
string
their
fingers
caught
in
string
string
tweaked
their
ears
and
flattened
their
confined
their
elbows
and
confused
their
legs
the
doorway
seemed
farther
farther
and
farther
they
turned
their
heads
they
were
following
backward
and
against
their
will
a
retreating
enemy
oh
why
didn
t
we
do
what
she
said
breathed
cathay
something
s
happened
i
should
think
it
had
said
bernard
we
re
a
they
were
and
a
tall
infantryman
of
the
under
folk
was
towing
them
away
from
merland
as
swiftly
and
as
easily
as
a
running
child
tows
a
captive
air
balloon
chapter
ten
under
those
of
us
who
have
had
the
misfortune
to
be
caught
in
a
net
in
the
execution
of
our
military
duty
and
to
be
dragged
away
by
the
enemy
with
all
the
helpless
buoyancy
of
captive
balloons
will
be
able
to
appreciate
the
sensations
of
the
four
children
to
whom
this
gloomy
catastrophe
had
occurred
the
net
was
very
of
twisted
fibrous
filaments
of
seaweed
all
efforts
to
break
it
were
vain
and
they
had
unfortunately
nothing
to
cut
it
with
they
had
not
even
their
oyster
shells
the
rough
edges
of
which
might
have
done
something
to
help
or
at
least
would
have
been
useful
weapons
and
the
discomfort
of
their
position
was
extreme
they
were
as
cathay
put
it
all
mixed
up
with
each
other
s
arms
and
legs
and
it
was
very
difficult
and
painful
to
sort
themselves
out
without
hurting
each
other
let
s
do
it
one
at
a
time
said
mavis
after
some
minutes
of
severe
and
unsuccessful
struggle
france
first
get
right
away
france
and
see
if
you
can
t
sit
down
on
a
piece
of
the
net
that
isn
t
covered
with
and
then
cathay
can
it
was
excellent
advice
and
when
all
four
had
followed
it
it
was
found
possible
to
sit
side
by
side
on
what
may
be
called
the
floor
of
the
net
only
the
squeezing
of
the
net
walls
tended
to
jerk
one
up
from
one
s
place
if
one
wasn
t
very
careful
by
the
time
the
rearrangement
was
complete
and
they
were
free
to
look
about
them
the
whole
aspect
of
the
world
had
changed
the
world
for
one
thing
was
much
darker
in
itself
that
is
though
the
part
of
it
where
the
children
were
was
much
lighter
than
had
been
the
sea
where
they
were
first
netted
it
was
a
curious
like
looking
down
on
london
at
night
from
the
top
of
paul
s
some
bright
things
like
trams
or
omnibuses
were
rushing
along
and
smaller
lights
which
looked
mighty
like
cabs
and
carriages
dotted
the
expanse
of
blackness
till
where
they
were
thick
set
the
darkness
disappeared
in
a
blaze
of
silvery
light
other
had
rows
of
round
lights
like
the
portholes
of
great
liners
one
came
sweeping
toward
them
and
a
wild
idea
came
to
cathay
that
perhaps
when
ships
sink
they
go
on
living
and
moving
underwater
just
as
she
and
the
others
had
done
perhaps
they
do
anyhow
this
was
not
one
of
them
for
as
it
came
close
it
was
plainly
to
be
perceived
as
a
vast
fish
with
phosphorescent
lights
in
rows
along
its
gigantic
sides
it
opened
its
jaws
as
it
passed
and
for
an
instant
everyone
shut
their
eyes
and
felt
that
all
was
over
when
the
eyes
were
opened
again
the
mighty
fish
was
far
away
cathay
however
was
discovered
to
be
in
tears
i
wish
we
hadn
t
come
she
said
and
the
others
could
not
but
feel
that
there
was
something
in
what
she
said
they
comforted
her
and
themselves
as
best
they
could
by
expressing
a
curious
which
they
had
that
everything
would
be
all
right
in
the
end
as
i
said
before
there
are
some
things
so
horrible
that
if
you
can
bring
yourself
to
face
them
you
see
at
once
that
they
can
t
be
true
the
barest
idea
of
poetic
we
all
believe
in
at
the
bottom
of
our
it
impossible
to
think
that
the
children
who
had
nobly
they
couldn
t
help
feeling
it
noble
defended
their
friends
the
mer
folk
should
have
anything
really
dreadful
happen
to
them
in
consequence
and
when
bernard
talked
about
the
fortunes
of
war
he
did
it
in
an
unconvinced
sort
of
way
and
francis
told
him
to
shut
up
illustration
the
but
what
are
we
to
do
sniffed
cathay
for
the
twentieth
time
and
all
the
while
the
infantryman
was
going
steadily
on
dragging
the
wretched
netful
after
him
press
our
pearl
buttons
suggested
francis
hopefully
then
we
shall
be
invisible
and
unfeelable
and
we
can
he
fumbled
with
the
round
pearl
no
no
said
bernard
catching
at
his
hand
don
t
you
see
if
we
do
we
may
never
get
out
of
the
net
if
they
can
t
see
us
or
feel
us
they
ll
think
the
net
s
empty
and
perhaps
hang
it
up
on
a
hook
or
put
it
away
in
a
and
forget
it
while
years
roll
by
see
said
cathay
but
we
can
undo
them
the
minute
we
re
there
can
t
we
said
mavis
yes
of
course
said
bernard
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
couldn
t
at
last
the
infantryman
after
threading
his
way
through
streets
of
enormous
rocky
palaces
passed
through
a
colossal
arch
and
so
into
a
hall
as
big
as
paul
s
and
westminster
abbey
into
one
a
crowd
of
under
folk
who
were
seated
on
stone
benches
around
rude
tables
eating
strange
luminous
food
rose
up
and
cried
what
news
four
prisoners
said
the
infantryman
upper
folk
the
colonel
said
and
my
orders
are
to
deliver
them
to
the
queen
he
passed
to
the
end
of
the
hall
and
up
a
long
wide
flight
of
steps
made
of
something
so
green
and
clear
that
it
was
plainly
either
glass
or
emerald
and
i
don
t
think
it
could
have
been
glass
because
how
could
they
have
made
glass
in
the
sea
there
were
lights
below
it
which
shone
through
the
green
transparency
so
clear
and
lovely
that
francis
said
fair
listen
where
thou
art
sitting
under
the
glassie
cool
translucent
wave
and
quite
suddenly
there
was
much
less
room
in
the
net
and
they
were
being
embraced
all
at
once
and
with
tears
of
relief
and
joy
by
the
princess
own
mer
princess
oh
i
mean
dear
i
said
francis
it
was
the
emerald
steps
made
me
think
of
so
they
are
she
said
but
oh
if
you
knew
what
i
ve
our
guests
our
our
noble
be
prisoners
and
all
of
us
safe
i
did
so
hope
you
d
call
me
and
i
m
so
proud
that
you
didn
you
were
brave
enough
not
to
call
for
me
until
you
did
it
by
we
never
thought
of
doing
it
said
mavis
candidly
but
i
hope
we
shouldn
t
have
if
we
thought
of
why
haven
t
you
pressed
your
pearl
buttons
she
asked
and
they
told
her
why
wise
children
she
said
but
at
any
rate
we
must
all
use
the
charm
that
prevents
our
losing
our
i
shan
t
use
mine
said
cathay
i
don
t
want
to
remember
if
i
didn
t
remember
i
should
forget
to
be
frightened
do
please
let
me
forget
to
she
clung
pleadingly
to
the
princess
who
whispered
to
mavis
perhaps
it
would
be
best
and
they
let
cathay
have
her
way
the
others
had
only
just
time
to
swallow
their
charms
before
the
infantryman
threw
the
net
onto
a
great
table
which
seemed
to
be
cut
out
of
one
vast
diamond
and
fell
on
his
face
on
the
ground
it
was
his
way
of
saluting
his
sovereign
prisoners
your
majesty
he
said
when
he
had
got
up
again
four
of
the
young
of
the
upper
and
he
turned
to
the
net
as
he
spoke
and
stopped
there
s
someone
else
he
said
in
an
altered
voice
someone
as
wasn
t
there
when
we
started
i
ll
open
the
net
said
a
strong
sweet
voice
and
bid
the
prisoners
stand
up
that
i
may
look
upon
they
might
escape
my
love
said
another
voice
anxiously
or
perhaps
they
submersia
said
the
first
voice
do
you
and
four
of
my
women
stand
ready
take
the
prisoners
one
by
one
seize
each
a
prisoner
and
hold
them
awaiting
my
royal
the
net
was
opened
and
large
and
strong
hands
took
bernard
who
was
nearest
the
mouth
of
the
net
back
and
held
him
gently
but
with
extreme
firmness
in
an
upright
position
on
the
table
none
of
them
could
stand
because
of
their
tails
they
saw
before
them
on
a
throne
a
tall
and
splendid
queen
very
beautiful
and
very
sad
and
by
her
side
a
king
they
knew
the
royalty
by
their
crowns
not
so
handsome
as
his
wife
but
still
very
different
from
the
uncouth
heavy
under
folk
and
he
looked
sad
too
they
were
clad
in
robes
of
richest
woven
seaweed
sewn
with
jewels
and
their
crowns
were
like
dreams
of
magnificence
their
throne
was
of
one
clear
ruby
and
its
canopy
of
green
drooping
seaweed
was
gemmed
with
topazes
and
amethysts
the
queen
rose
and
came
down
the
steps
of
the
throne
and
whispered
to
her
whom
she
had
called
submersia
and
she
in
turn
whispered
to
the
four
other
large
ladies
who
held
each
a
captive
and
with
a
dreadful
unanimity
the
five
acted
with
one
dexterous
movement
they
took
off
the
magic
jackets
and
with
another
they
removed
the
useful
tails
the
princess
and
the
four
children
stood
upon
the
table
on
their
own
ten
feet
what
funny
little
things
said
the
king
not
unkindly
hush
said
the
queen
perhaps
they
can
understand
what
you
at
any
rate
that
the
children
were
furious
to
hear
their
princess
so
disrespectfully
spoken
of
but
she
herself
remained
beautifully
calm
now
said
the
queen
before
we
destroy
your
memories
will
you
answer
questions
some
questions
no
said
the
princess
are
these
human
children
how
do
they
come
under
the
sea
you
wouldn
t
understand
said
the
princess
haughtily
were
they
fighting
against
us
yes
cried
bernard
and
mavis
before
the
princess
answered
and
lucky
to
do
it
francis
added
if
you
will
tell
us
the
fighting
strength
of
the
merlanders
your
tails
and
coats
shall
be
restored
to
you
and
you
shall
go
free
will
you
tell
is
it
likely
the
princess
answered
i
am
a
and
a
princess
of
the
royal
house
such
do
not
betray
their
no
i
suppose
not
said
the
queen
and
she
paused
a
moment
before
she
said
administer
the
cup
of
the
cup
of
forgetfulness
was
exceedingly
pleasant
it
tasted
of
toffee
and
coconuts
and
pineapple
ices
and
plum
cake
and
roast
chicken
with
a
faint
underflavor
of
lavender
rose
leaves
and
the
very
best
de
the
children
had
tasted
and
at
parties
and
had
disliked
both
but
was
delicious
it
was
served
in
a
goblet
of
opal
color
in
dreamy
pink
and
green
and
blue
and
the
sides
of
the
goblet
were
engraved
with
pictures
of
beautiful
people
asleep
the
goblet
passed
from
hand
to
hand
and
when
each
had
drunk
enough
the
lord
high
cupbearer
a
very
handsome
fish
laid
a
restraining
touch
on
the
goblet
and
taking
it
between
his
fins
handed
it
to
the
next
drinker
so
one
by
one
each
took
the
draught
kathleen
was
the
last
the
draught
had
no
effect
on
four
out
of
the
kathleen
changed
before
their
eyes
and
though
they
had
known
that
the
draught
of
oblivion
would
make
her
forget
it
was
terrible
to
see
it
do
its
fell
work
mavis
had
her
arm
protectingly
around
kathleen
and
the
moment
the
draught
had
been
swallowed
kathleen
threw
off
that
loving
arm
and
drew
herself
away
it
hurt
like
a
knife
then
she
looked
at
her
brothers
and
sisters
and
it
is
a
very
terrible
thing
when
the
eyes
you
love
look
at
you
as
though
you
were
a
stranger
now
it
had
been
agreed
while
still
the
captives
were
in
the
net
that
all
of
them
should
pretend
that
the
cup
of
oblivion
had
taken
effect
that
they
should
just
keep
still
and
say
nothing
and
look
as
stupid
as
they
could
but
this
coldness
of
her
dear
cathay
s
was
more
than
mavis
could
bear
and
no
one
had
counted
on
it
so
when
cathay
looked
at
mavis
as
at
a
stranger
whom
she
rather
disliked
and
drew
away
from
her
arm
mavis
could
not
bear
it
and
cried
out
in
tones
oh
cathay
darling
what
is
it
what
s
the
matter
before
the
princess
or
the
boys
could
stop
her
and
to
make
matters
worse
both
boys
said
in
a
very
loud
plain
whisper
shut
up
mavis
and
only
the
princess
kept
enough
presence
of
mind
to
go
on
saying
nothing
cathay
turned
and
looked
at
her
sister
cathay
darling
mavis
said
again
and
stopped
for
no
one
could
go
on
saying
darling
to
anyone
who
looked
at
you
as
cathay
was
looking
she
turned
her
eyes
away
as
cathay
looked
toward
the
and
went
to
lean
against
the
royal
knee
as
though
it
had
been
her
mother
s
dear
little
thing
said
the
queen
see
it
s
quite
tame
i
shall
keep
it
for
a
pet
nice
little
pet
then
you
shan
t
keep
her
cried
mavis
but
again
the
princess
hushed
her
and
the
queen
treated
her
cry
with
contemptuous
indifference
cathay
snuggled
against
her
new
mistress
as
for
the
rest
of
you
said
the
queen
it
is
evident
from
your
manner
that
the
draught
of
oblivion
has
not
yet
taken
effect
on
you
so
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
make
presents
of
you
to
those
prominent
members
of
the
nobility
who
are
wanting
pets
as
i
should
otherwise
have
done
we
will
try
another
draught
tomorrow
in
the
meantime
the
fetters
a
tall
stepped
forward
hanging
over
his
arm
were
scaly
tails
which
at
first
sight
of
the
children
s
hearts
leaped
for
they
hoped
they
were
their
own
but
no
sooner
were
the
tails
fitted
on
than
they
knew
the
bitter
truth
yes
said
the
queen
they
are
false
tails
you
will
not
be
able
to
take
them
off
and
you
can
neither
swim
nor
walk
with
them
you
can
however
move
along
quite
comfortably
on
the
floor
of
the
ocean
what
s
the
matter
she
asked
the
jailer
none
of
the
tails
will
fit
this
prisoner
your
majesty
said
the
jailer
i
am
a
princess
of
the
reigning
mer
house
said
freia
and
your
false
degrading
tails
can
not
cling
to
oh
put
them
all
in
the
lockup
said
the
king
as
sullen
a
lot
of
prisoners
as
ever
i
the
lockup
was
a
great
building
broader
at
the
top
than
at
the
bottom
which
seemed
to
be
balanced
on
the
sea
floor
but
really
it
was
propped
up
at
both
ends
with
great
chunks
of
rock
the
prisoners
were
taken
there
in
the
net
and
being
dragged
along
in
nets
is
so
confusing
that
it
was
not
till
the
jailer
had
left
them
that
they
discovered
that
the
prison
was
really
a
enormous
lay
there
perfect
in
every
detail
as
on
the
day
when
it
first
left
dock
the
water
did
not
seem
to
have
spoiled
it
at
all
they
were
imprisoned
in
the
saloon
and
worn
out
with
the
varied
emotions
of
the
day
they
lay
down
on
the
comfortable
red
velvet
cushions
and
went
to
sleep
even
mavis
felt
that
kathleen
had
found
a
friend
in
the
queen
and
was
in
no
danger
the
princess
was
the
last
to
close
her
eyes
she
looked
long
at
the
sleeping
children
oh
don
t
they
think
of
it
she
said
and
why
mustn
t
i
tell
them
there
was
no
answer
to
either
question
and
presently
she
too
slept
i
must
own
that
i
share
the
princess
s
wonder
that
the
children
did
not
spend
the
night
in
saying
sabrina
fair
over
and
over
again
because
of
course
each
invocation
would
have
been
answered
by
an
inhabitant
of
merland
and
thus
a
small
army
could
easily
have
been
collected
the
jailer
overpowered
and
a
rush
made
for
freedom
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
all
that
happened
to
kathleen
because
the
daily
life
of
a
pampered
to
a
reigning
queen
is
one
that
you
would
find
most
interesting
to
read
about
as
interesting
as
your
rover
or
binkie
would
find
it
to
he
could
the
life
of
one
of
queen
alexandra
s
japanese
spaniels
but
time
is
getting
on
and
i
must
make
a
long
story
short
and
anyhow
you
can
never
tell
all
about
everything
can
you
the
next
day
the
jailers
brought
food
to
the
prison
as
well
as
a
second
draught
of
oblivion
which
of
course
had
no
effect
and
they
spent
the
day
wondering
how
they
could
escape
in
the
evening
the
jailer
s
son
brought
more
food
and
more
and
he
lingered
while
they
ate
he
did
not
look
at
all
unkind
and
francis
ventured
to
speak
to
him
i
say
he
said
what
do
you
say
the
asked
are
you
forbidden
to
talk
to
us
then
do
tell
us
what
they
will
do
with
i
do
not
know
but
we
shall
have
to
know
before
long
the
prisons
are
filling
up
will
soon
be
quite
full
then
we
shall
have
to
let
some
of
you
out
on
what
is
called
means
with
your
artificial
tails
on
which
prevent
you
getting
away
even
if
the
doesn
t
take
i
say
it
was
bernard
s
turn
to
ask
what
do
you
say
why
don
t
the
king
and
queen
go
and
fight
like
the
mer
royal
family
do
against
the
law
said
the
we
took
a
king
prisoner
once
and
our
people
were
afraid
our
king
and
queen
might
be
taken
so
they
made
that
what
did
you
do
with
prisoner
king
the
princess
asked
put
him
in
an
iswater
said
the
lad
a
piece
of
water
entirely
surrounded
by
i
should
like
to
see
him
said
the
princess
nothing
easier
said
the
as
soon
as
you
get
your
it
s
a
good
long
passage
to
the
all
water
of
course
but
lots
of
our
young
people
go
there
three
times
a
week
of
course
he
can
t
be
a
king
anymore
they
made
him
professor
of
and
has
he
forgotten
he
was
a
asked
the
princess
of
course
but
he
was
so
learned
the
wasn
t
deep
enough
to
make
him
forget
everything
that
s
why
he
s
a
what
was
he
king
of
the
princess
asked
anxiously
he
was
king
of
the
barbarians
said
the
jailer
s
the
princess
sighed
i
thought
it
might
have
been
my
father
she
said
he
was
lost
at
sea
you
the
nodded
sympathetically
and
went
away
he
doesn
t
seem
such
a
bad
sort
said
mavis
no
said
the
princess
i
can
t
understand
it
i
thought
all
the
under
folk
were
terrible
fierce
creatures
cruel
and
and
they
don
t
seem
so
very
different
from
to
look
at
said
bernard
i
wonder
said
mavis
what
the
war
began
about
ve
always
been
enemies
said
the
princess
carelessly
how
did
you
begin
being
enemies
oh
that
said
the
princess
is
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
before
the
dawn
of
history
and
all
oh
said
mavis
but
when
ulfin
came
with
the
next
i
tell
you
that
the
jailer
s
son
s
name
was
ulfin
asked
him
the
same
question
i
don
t
said
ulfin
but
i
will
find
uncle
is
the
keeper
of
the
national
archives
graven
on
tables
of
stone
so
many
that
no
one
can
count
them
but
there
are
smaller
tables
telling
what
is
on
the
big
he
hesitated
if
i
could
get
leave
to
show
you
the
hall
of
the
archives
would
you
promise
not
to
try
to
escape
they
had
now
been
shut
up
for
two
days
and
would
have
promised
anything
in
reason
you
see
the
prisons
are
quite
full
now
he
said
and
i
don
t
see
why
you
shouldn
t
be
the
first
to
get
your
i
ll
ask
my
i
say
said
mavis
what
do
you
say
said
ulfin
do
you
know
anything
about
my
sister
the
queen
s
new
s
a
great
gold
collar
with
her
name
on
it
came
home
today
my
cousin
s
made
the
said
mavis
the
name
on
the
collar
is
fido
said
ulfin
the
next
day
ulfin
brought
their
made
of
the
leaves
of
the
tree
of
liberty
which
grows
at
the
bottom
of
the
well
where
truth
lies
don
t
lose
them
he
said
and
come
with
they
found
it
quite
possible
to
move
along
slowly
on
hands
and
tails
though
they
looked
rather
like
seals
as
they
did
so
he
led
them
through
the
strange
streets
of
massive
passages
pointing
out
the
buildings
giving
them
their
names
as
you
might
do
if
you
were
showing
the
marvels
of
your
own
city
to
a
stranger
that
s
the
astrologers
tower
he
said
pointing
to
a
huge
building
high
above
the
others
the
wise
men
sit
there
and
observe
the
but
you
can
t
see
the
stars
down
oh
yes
we
can
the
tower
is
fitted
up
with
tubes
and
mirrors
and
water
transparence
apparatus
the
wisest
men
in
the
country
are
but
the
professor
of
conchology
he
s
the
wisest
of
all
he
invented
the
nets
that
caught
rather
making
nets
was
one
of
the
things
that
he
had
learned
and
couldn
t
but
who
thought
of
using
them
for
catching
prisoners
i
did
said
ulfin
proudly
i
m
to
have
a
glass
medal
for
do
you
have
glass
down
here
a
little
comes
down
you
know
it
is
very
precious
we
engrave
it
that
is
the
of
tables
of
hall
of
public
joy
is
next
to
garden
is
the
mothers
garden
where
they
go
to
rest
while
their
children
are
at
s
one
of
our
schools
and
here
s
the
hall
of
public
the
keeper
of
the
records
received
them
with
grave
courtesy
the
daily
services
of
ulfin
had
accustomed
the
children
to
the
appearance
of
the
under
folk
and
they
no
longer
found
their
strange
mournful
faces
terrifying
and
the
great
hall
where
on
shelves
cut
out
of
the
sheer
rock
were
stored
the
graven
tables
of
underworld
records
was
very
wonderful
and
impressive
what
is
it
you
want
to
know
said
the
keeper
rolling
away
some
of
the
stones
he
had
been
showing
them
ulfin
said
there
was
something
why
the
war
began
said
francis
why
the
king
and
queen
are
different
said
mavis
the
war
said
the
keeper
of
the
records
began
exactly
three
million
five
hundred
and
thousand
three
hundred
and
eight
years
ago
an
getting
off
his
sea
horse
in
a
hurry
trod
on
the
tail
of
a
sleeping
merman
he
did
not
apologize
because
he
was
under
a
vow
not
to
speak
for
a
year
and
a
day
if
the
had
only
waited
he
would
have
explained
but
they
went
to
war
at
once
and
of
course
after
that
you
couldn
t
expect
him
to
apologize
and
the
war
has
gone
on
off
and
on
and
on
and
off
ever
illustration
hall
of
public
and
won
t
it
ever
stop
asked
bernard
not
till
we
apologize
which
of
course
we
can
t
until
find
out
why
the
war
began
and
that
it
wasn
t
our
how
awful
said
mavis
then
it
s
all
really
about
quite
so
said
the
keeper
what
are
your
wars
about
the
other
question
i
shouldn
t
answer
only
i
know
you
ll
forget
it
when
the
begins
to
work
ulfin
tells
me
it
hasn
t
begun
yet
our
king
and
queen
are
we
used
to
be
a
republic
but
presidents
were
so
uppish
and
so
grasping
and
all
their
friends
and
relations
too
so
we
decided
to
be
a
monarchy
and
that
all
jealousies
might
be
taken
away
we
imported
the
two
handsomest
land
folk
we
could
find
they
ve
been
a
great
success
and
as
they
have
no
relations
we
find
it
much
less
when
the
keeper
had
thus
kindly
gratified
the
curiosity
of
the
prisoners
the
princess
said
suddenly
couldn
t
we
learn
conchology
and
the
keeper
said
kindly
why
not
it
s
the
professor
s
day
couldn
t
we
go
there
today
asked
the
princess
just
to
arrange
about
times
and
terms
and
all
that
if
my
uncle
says
i
may
take
you
there
said
ulfin
i
will
for
i
have
never
known
any
pleasure
so
great
as
doing
anything
that
you
wish
will
give
the
uncle
looked
a
little
anxious
but
he
said
he
thought
there
could
be
no
harm
in
calling
on
the
professor
so
they
went
the
way
was
long
for
people
who
were
not
seals
by
nature
and
were
not
yet
compelled
to
walk
after
the
manner
of
those
charming
and
intelligent
animals
the
mer
princess
alone
was
at
her
ease
but
when
they
passed
a
building
as
long
as
from
here
to
the
end
of
the
mile
end
road
which
ulfin
told
them
was
the
cavalry
barracks
a
young
leaned
out
of
a
window
and
said
what
ho
what
ho
yourself
said
ulfin
and
approaching
the
window
spoke
in
whispers
two
minutes
later
the
young
cavalry
officer
who
had
leaned
out
of
the
window
gave
an
order
and
almost
at
once
some
magnificent
sea
horses
richly
caparisoned
came
out
from
under
an
arched
gateway
the
three
children
were
mounted
on
these
and
the
crowd
which
had
collected
in
the
street
seemed
to
find
it
most
amusing
to
see
people
in
riding
on
the
chargers
of
the
horse
marines
but
their
laughter
was
not
and
the
horses
were
indeed
a
boon
to
the
weary
tails
of
the
amateur
seals
riding
along
the
bottom
of
the
sea
was
a
wonderful
soon
the
open
country
was
left
behind
and
they
began
to
go
up
ways
cut
in
the
heart
of
the
long
and
steep
and
lighted
as
all
that
great
underworld
was
with
phosphorescent
light
when
they
had
been
traveling
for
some
hours
and
the
children
were
beginning
to
think
that
you
could
perhaps
have
too
much
even
of
such
an
excellent
thing
as
sea
horse
exercise
the
phosphorescent
lights
suddenly
stopped
and
yet
the
sea
was
not
dark
there
seemed
to
be
a
light
ahead
and
it
got
stronger
and
stronger
as
they
advanced
and
presently
it
streamed
down
on
them
from
shallow
water
above
their
heads
we
leave
the
sea
horses
here
said
ulfin
they
can
not
live
in
the
air
they
dismounted
and
swam
up
at
least
ulfin
and
the
princess
swam
and
the
others
held
hands
and
were
pulled
by
the
two
swimmers
almost
at
once
their
heads
struck
the
surface
of
the
water
and
there
they
were
on
the
verge
of
a
rocky
shore
they
landed
and
you
can
call
what
seals
do
a
ridge
of
land
then
plunged
into
a
landlocked
lake
that
lay
beyond
illustration
chargers
of
the
horse
this
is
the
iswater
said
ulfin
as
they
touched
bottom
and
yonder
is
the
and
indeed
a
stately
figure
in
long
robes
was
coming
toward
them
but
this
said
the
princess
trembling
is
just
like
our
garden
at
home
only
it
was
made
as
it
is
said
ulfin
by
wish
of
the
captive
king
majesty
is
majesty
be
it
never
so
the
advancing
figure
was
now
quite
near
them
it
saluted
them
with
royal
courtesy
we
wanted
to
know
said
mavis
please
your
majesty
if
we
might
have
lessons
from
the
king
answered
but
the
princess
did
not
hear
she
was
speaking
with
ulfin
apart
ulfin
she
said
this
captive
king
is
my
yes
princess
said
ulfin
and
he
does
not
know
he
will
said
ulfin
strongly
did
you
know
but
the
people
of
your
land
will
punish
you
for
bringing
us
here
if
they
find
out
that
he
is
my
father
and
that
you
have
brought
us
together
they
will
kill
you
why
did
you
do
it
ulfin
because
you
wished
it
princess
he
said
and
because
i
would
rather
die
for
you
than
live
without
chapter
eleven
the
children
thought
they
had
never
seen
a
kinder
face
or
more
noble
bearing
than
that
of
the
professor
of
conchology
but
the
mer
princess
could
not
bear
to
look
at
him
she
now
felt
what
mavis
had
felt
when
cathay
failed
to
recognize
misery
of
being
looked
at
without
recognition
by
the
eyes
that
we
know
and
love
she
turned
away
and
pretended
to
be
looking
at
the
leaves
of
the
seaweed
hedge
while
mavis
and
francis
were
arranging
to
take
lessons
in
conchology
three
days
a
week
from
two
to
four
you
had
better
join
a
class
said
the
professor
you
will
learn
less
that
but
we
want
to
learn
said
mavis
and
the
professor
looked
at
her
very
searchingly
and
said
do
you
yes
she
said
at
yes
he
said
i
quite
understand
i
am
only
an
exiled
professor
teaching
conchology
to
youthful
aliens
but
i
retain
some
remnants
of
the
wisdom
of
my
many
years
i
know
that
i
am
not
what
i
seem
and
that
you
are
not
what
you
seem
and
that
your
desire
to
learn
my
special
subject
is
not
sincere
and
but
is
merely
or
mainly
the
cloak
to
some
other
design
is
it
not
so
my
child
no
one
answered
his
question
was
so
plainly
addressed
to
the
princess
and
she
must
have
felt
the
question
for
she
turned
and
said
yes
o
most
wise
i
am
no
king
said
the
professor
rather
i
am
a
weak
child
picking
up
pebbles
by
the
shore
of
an
infinite
sea
of
you
the
princess
was
beginning
impulsively
when
ulfin
interrupted
her
lady
lady
he
said
all
will
be
lost
can
you
not
play
your
part
better
than
this
if
you
continue
these
indiscretions
my
head
will
undoubtedly
pay
the
forfeit
not
that
i
should
for
a
moment
grudge
that
trifling
service
but
if
my
head
is
cut
off
you
will
be
left
without
a
friend
in
this
strange
country
and
i
shall
die
with
the
annoying
consciousness
that
i
shall
no
longer
be
able
to
serve
he
whispered
this
into
the
princess
s
ear
while
the
professor
of
conchology
looked
on
with
mild
surprise
your
attendant
he
observed
is
eloquent
but
i
mean
to
be
said
ulfin
with
a
sudden
change
of
manner
look
here
sir
i
don
t
suppose
you
care
what
becomes
of
not
in
the
least
said
the
professor
but
i
suppose
you
would
be
sorry
if
anything
uncomfortable
happened
to
your
new
pupils
yes
said
the
professor
and
his
eye
dwelt
on
freia
then
please
concentrate
your
powerful
mind
on
being
a
professor
think
of
nothing
else
more
depends
on
this
than
you
can
easily
believing
is
easy
said
the
professor
tomorrow
at
two
i
think
you
said
and
with
a
grave
salutation
he
turned
his
back
on
the
company
and
walked
away
through
his
garden
it
was
a
thoughtful
party
that
rode
home
on
the
borrowed
chargers
of
the
deep
sea
cavalry
no
one
spoke
the
minds
of
all
were
busy
with
the
strange
words
of
ulfin
and
even
the
least
imaginative
of
them
which
in
this
case
was
bernard
could
not
but
think
that
ulfin
had
in
that
strange
oddly
shaped
head
of
his
some
plan
for
helping
the
prisoners
to
one
of
whom
at
least
he
was
so
obviously
attached
he
also
was
silent
and
the
others
could
not
help
encouraging
the
hope
that
he
was
maturing
plans
they
reached
the
prison
gave
up
their
and
reentered
it
it
was
not
till
they
were
in
the
saloon
and
the
evening
was
all
but
over
that
bernard
spoke
of
what
was
in
every
head
look
here
he
said
i
think
ulfin
means
to
help
us
to
do
you
said
mavis
i
think
he
means
to
help
us
to
something
but
i
don
t
somehow
think
it
s
as
simple
as
nothing
near
said
francis
simply
but
that
s
all
we
want
isn
t
it
said
bernard
it
s
not
all
want
said
mavis
finishing
the
last
of
a
fine
bunch
of
what
i
want
is
to
get
the
mer
king
restored
to
his
sorrowing
the
mer
princess
pressed
her
hand
affectionately
so
do
i
said
francis
but
i
want
something
more
than
that
even
i
want
to
stop
this
war
for
always
so
that
there
ll
never
be
any
more
of
but
how
can
you
said
the
mer
princess
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
table
there
s
always
been
war
there
always
will
why
asked
francis
i
don
t
know
it
s
merman
nature
i
i
don
t
believe
it
said
francis
earnestly
not
for
a
minute
i
don
t
why
don
t
you
see
all
these
people
you
re
at
war
with
are
look
how
kind
the
queen
is
to
how
kind
ulfin
is
to
the
librarian
and
the
keeper
of
the
archives
and
the
soldiers
who
lent
us
the
horses
they
re
all
as
decent
as
they
can
stick
and
all
the
are
nice
then
they
all
go
killing
each
other
and
all
those
brave
jolly
soldier
fish
too
just
all
about
nothing
i
call
it
simply
but
there
always
has
been
war
i
tell
you
said
the
people
would
get
slack
and
silly
and
cowardly
if
there
were
no
if
i
were
king
said
francis
who
was
now
thoroughly
roused
there
should
never
be
any
more
wars
there
are
plenty
of
things
to
be
brave
about
without
hurting
other
brave
and
rescuing
and
saving
your
comrades
in
mines
and
in
fires
and
floods
and
things
his
eloquence
suddenly
gave
way
to
a
breathless
oh
well
he
ended
it
s
no
use
gassing
you
know
what
i
yes
said
mavis
and
oh
think
you
re
right
but
what
can
we
i
shall
ask
to
see
the
queen
of
the
under
folk
and
try
to
make
her
see
sense
she
didn
t
look
an
absolute
they
all
gasped
at
the
glorious
and
simple
daring
of
the
idea
but
the
mer
princess
said
i
know
you
d
do
everything
you
it
s
very
difficult
to
talk
to
kings
unless
you
ve
been
accustomed
to
it
there
are
books
in
the
cave
talks
with
and
i
have
spoken
my
mind
which
might
help
you
but
unfortunately
we
can
t
get
them
you
see
kings
start
so
much
further
than
subjects
do
they
know
such
a
lot
more
why
even
then
why
won
t
try
talking
to
the
queen
i
shouldn
t
dare
said
freia
i
m
only
a
oh
if
only
my
dear
father
could
talk
to
her
if
he
believed
it
possible
that
war
could
cease
could
persuade
anybody
of
anything
and
of
course
they
would
start
on
the
same
monarchs
you
i
see
like
belonging
to
the
same
club
said
francis
vaguely
but
of
course
as
things
are
my
royal
father
thinks
of
nothing
but
only
we
could
restore
his
memory
i
say
said
bernard
suddenly
does
that
charm
work
backward
backward
i
it
any
use
taking
it
after
you
ve
swallowed
your
dose
of
is
it
a
rester
what
s
its
name
as
well
as
an
antidote
surely
said
the
princess
it
is
a
restorative
only
we
have
no
charm
to
give
my
are
not
made
in
this
alas
we
can
not
escape
and
go
to
our
own
kingdom
and
return
with
no
need
said
bernard
with
growing
excitement
no
need
cathay
s
charm
is
there
in
the
inner
pocket
of
her
magic
coat
if
we
could
get
that
give
the
charm
to
your
father
and
then
get
him
an
interview
with
the
queen
but
what
about
cathay
said
mavis
if
my
father
s
memory
were
restored
said
the
princess
his
wisdom
would
find
us
a
way
out
of
all
our
difficulties
to
find
cathay
s
coat
that
is
what
we
have
to
yes
said
francis
that
s
he
spoke
a
little
bitterly
for
he
had
really
rather
looked
forward
to
that
straight
talk
with
the
king
and
the
others
had
not
been
as
enthusiastic
as
he
felt
he
had
a
right
to
expect
let
s
call
ulfin
said
the
princess
and
they
all
scratched
on
the
door
of
polished
bird
maple
that
separated
their
apartments
from
the
rest
of
the
prison
the
electric
bells
were
out
of
order
so
one
scratched
instead
of
ringing
it
was
quite
as
easy
ulfin
came
with
all
speed
we
re
holding
a
council
said
freia
and
we
want
you
to
help
we
know
you
i
know
it
said
ulfin
tell
me
your
and
without
more
ado
they
told
him
all
you
trust
me
princess
i
am
proud
he
told
her
but
when
he
heard
francis
s
dream
of
universal
peace
he
took
the
freckled
paw
of
francis
and
laid
his
lips
to
it
and
francis
even
in
the
midst
of
his
pride
and
embarrassment
at
this
token
could
not
help
noticing
that
the
lips
of
ulfin
were
hard
like
horn
i
kiss
your
hand
said
ulfin
because
you
give
me
back
my
honor
which
i
was
willing
to
lay
down
with
all
else
for
the
princess
to
walk
on
to
safety
and
escape
i
would
have
helped
you
to
find
the
hidden
her
sake
alone
and
that
would
have
been
a
sin
against
my
honor
and
my
now
that
i
know
it
is
to
lead
to
peace
which
warriors
as
we
are
the
whole
nation
passionately
desires
then
i
am
acting
as
a
true
and
honorable
patriot
my
only
regret
is
that
i
have
one
gift
the
less
to
lay
at
the
feet
of
the
do
you
know
where
the
coats
are
mavis
asked
they
are
in
the
foreign
curiosities
museum
said
ulfin
strongly
guarded
but
the
guards
are
the
horse
officer
lent
you
your
chargers
today
he
is
my
friend
and
when
i
tell
him
what
is
toward
he
will
help
me
i
only
ask
of
you
one
promise
in
return
that
you
will
not
seek
to
escape
or
to
return
to
your
own
country
except
by
the
free
leave
and
license
of
our
gracious
the
children
easily
they
thought
the
promise
would
be
easily
kept
then
tomorrow
said
ulfin
shall
begin
the
splendid
peace
plot
which
shall
hand
our
names
down
haloed
with
glory
to
remotest
he
looked
kindly
on
them
and
went
out
he
a
dear
isn
t
he
said
mavis
yes
indeed
said
the
princess
absently
and
now
next
day
the
children
carrying
their
were
led
to
the
great
pearl
and
turquoise
building
which
was
the
museum
of
foreign
curiosities
many
were
the
strange
objects
preserved
and
glass
and
books
and
of
all
kinds
taken
from
sunken
ships
and
all
the
things
were
under
cases
apparently
of
glass
the
curator
of
the
museum
showed
them
his
treasures
with
pride
and
explained
them
all
wrong
in
the
most
interesting
way
those
discs
he
said
pointing
to
the
china
plates
are
used
in
games
of
skill
they
are
thrown
from
one
hand
to
another
and
if
one
fails
to
catch
them
his
head
is
an
egg
boiler
he
explained
was
a
land
queen
s
jewel
case
and
four
emeralds
had
been
fitted
into
it
to
show
its
use
to
the
vulgar
a
silver
ice
pail
was
labeled
drinking
vessel
of
the
horses
of
the
kings
of
earth
and
a
cigar
case
half
full
was
called
charm
case
containing
evil
charms
probably
ancient
in
fact
it
was
very
like
the
museums
you
see
on
land
they
were
just
coming
to
a
large
case
containing
something
whitish
and
labeled
very
valuable
indeed
when
a
messenger
came
to
tell
the
curator
that
a
soldier
was
waiting
with
valuable
curiosities
taken
as
loot
from
the
enemy
excuse
me
one
moment
said
the
curator
and
left
them
arranged
that
said
ulfin
quick
before
he
your
coats
if
you
know
any
spell
to
remove
the
the
princess
laughed
and
laid
her
hand
on
the
glassy
dome
and
lo
it
broke
and
disappeared
as
a
bubble
does
when
you
touch
it
magic
whispered
ulfin
not
magic
said
the
princess
your
cases
are
only
and
i
never
knew
said
ulfin
no
said
the
princess
because
you
never
dared
to
touch
the
children
were
already
busy
pulling
the
coats
off
the
ruby
slab
where
they
lay
here
s
cathay
s
whispered
mavis
the
princess
snatched
it
and
her
own
pearly
coat
which
in
one
quick
movement
she
put
on
and
buttoned
over
cathay
s
little
folded
coat
holding
this
against
her
quick
she
said
put
yours
on
all
of
you
take
your
on
your
they
did
the
soldiers
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
had
noticed
the
movements
and
came
charging
up
toward
them
quick
quick
said
the
princess
one
two
three
press
your
third
the
children
did
and
the
soldiers
tearing
up
the
hall
to
arrest
the
breakers
of
the
cases
of
the
by
this
time
they
could
see
what
had
fell
over
each
other
in
their
confusion
for
there
where
a
moment
ago
had
been
four
children
with
fetters
was
now
empty
space
and
beside
the
rifled
museum
case
stood
only
ulfin
and
then
an
odd
thing
happened
out
of
nowhere
as
it
seemed
a
little
pearly
coat
appeared
hanging
alone
in
air
water
of
course
it
was
really
or
was
it
it
seemed
to
grow
and
to
twine
itself
round
ulfin
put
it
on
said
a
voice
from
invisibility
put
it
on
and
ulfin
did
put
it
on
the
soldiers
were
close
upon
him
press
the
third
button
cried
the
princess
and
ulfin
did
so
but
as
his
right
hand
sought
the
button
the
foremost
soldier
caught
his
left
arm
with
the
bitter
traitor
i
arrest
you
in
the
king
s
name
and
though
he
could
now
not
see
that
he
was
holding
anything
he
could
feel
that
he
was
and
he
held
on
the
last
button
ulfin
cried
the
voice
of
the
unseen
princess
press
the
last
button
and
next
moment
the
soldier
breathless
with
amazement
and
terror
was
looking
stupidly
at
his
empty
hand
ulfin
as
well
as
the
three
children
and
the
princess
was
not
only
invisible
but
intangible
the
soldiers
could
not
see
or
feel
anything
and
what
is
more
neither
could
the
princess
or
the
children
or
ulfin
oh
where
are
you
where
am
i
cried
mavis
silence
said
the
princess
we
must
keep
together
by
our
voices
but
that
is
dangerous
la
porte
she
added
how
fortunate
it
was
that
none
of
the
soldiers
understood
french
as
the
five
were
invisible
and
intangible
and
as
the
soldiers
were
neither
it
was
easy
to
avoid
them
and
to
get
to
the
arched
doorway
the
princess
got
there
first
there
was
no
enemy
the
soldiers
were
crowding
around
the
rifled
museum
case
talking
and
wondering
the
soldier
who
had
seized
ulfin
explaining
again
and
again
how
he
had
had
the
caitiff
by
the
arm
as
solid
as
solid
and
then
all
in
a
minute
there
was
at
all
and
his
comrades
trying
their
best
to
believe
him
the
princess
just
waited
saying
are
you
there
every
three
seconds
as
though
she
had
been
at
the
telephone
are
you
there
said
the
princess
for
the
time
and
then
ulfin
said
i
am
here
we
must
have
connecting
links
she
bits
of
seaweed
would
do
if
you
hold
a
piece
of
seaweed
in
your
hand
i
will
take
hold
of
the
other
end
of
it
we
can
not
feel
the
touch
of
each
other
s
hands
but
we
shall
feel
the
seaweed
and
you
will
know
by
its
being
drawn
tight
that
i
have
hold
of
the
other
end
get
some
pieces
for
the
children
too
good
stout
seaweed
such
as
you
made
the
nets
of
with
which
you
captured
ah
princess
he
said
how
can
i
regret
that
enough
and
yet
how
can
i
regret
it
at
all
since
it
has
brought
you
to
peace
foolish
child
said
the
princess
and
ulfin
s
heart
leaped
for
joy
because
when
a
princess
calls
a
man
child
it
means
that
she
likes
him
more
than
a
little
or
else
of
course
she
would
not
take
such
a
liberty
but
the
seaweed
she
added
there
is
no
time
to
i
have
some
in
my
pocket
said
ulfin
blushing
only
she
could
not
see
that
they
keep
me
busy
making
nets
in
my
spare
always
have
some
string
in
my
a
piece
of
stringy
seaweed
suddenly
became
visible
as
ulfin
took
it
out
of
his
invisible
pocket
which
of
course
had
the
property
of
making
its
contents
invisible
too
so
long
as
they
remained
in
it
it
floated
toward
the
princess
who
caught
the
end
nearest
to
her
and
held
it
fast
where
are
you
said
a
small
voice
it
was
almost
at
once
francis
and
bernard
were
there
too
the
seaweed
chain
was
explained
to
them
and
they
each
held
fast
to
their
ends
of
the
seaweed
links
so
that
when
the
soldiers
a
little
late
in
the
day
owing
to
the
careful
management
of
ulfin
s
friend
reached
the
front
door
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
four
bits
of
seaweed
floating
down
the
street
which
of
course
was
the
sort
of
thing
that
nobody
could
possibly
notice
unless
they
the
bits
of
seaweed
went
drifting
to
the
barracks
and
no
one
noticed
that
they
floated
on
to
the
stables
and
that
invisible
hands
loosed
the
halters
of
five
sea
horses
the
soldier
who
ought
to
have
been
looking
after
the
horses
was
deeply
engaged
in
a
game
of
animal
grab
with
a
comrade
the
cards
were
of
narwhal
ivory
very
fine
indeed
and
jeweled
on
every
pip
the
invisible
hands
saddled
the
sea
horses
and
invisible
forms
sprang
to
the
saddles
and
urged
the
horses
forward
the
unfortunate
animal
grabber
was
roused
from
his
game
by
the
sight
of
five
retreating
and
bridled
indeed
but
as
far
as
he
could
see
riderless
and
long
before
other
horses
could
be
got
out
and
saddled
the
fugitives
were
out
of
sight
and
pursuit
was
vain
just
as
before
they
went
across
country
to
the
rock
cut
and
then
swam
up
holding
by
the
linking
seaweed
because
it
was
tuesday
and
nearly
two
o
clock
the
professor
of
conchology
was
making
ready
to
receive
pupils
which
he
did
in
an
arbor
of
coral
of
various
shades
of
pink
surrounded
by
specimen
shells
of
all
the
simpler
species
he
was
alone
in
the
garden
and
as
they
neared
him
the
princess
the
three
children
and
ulfin
touched
the
necessary
buttons
and
became
once
more
visible
and
tangible
ha
said
the
professor
but
without
surprise
magic
a
very
neat
trick
my
dears
and
excellently
you
need
not
remove
your
jacket
he
added
to
ulfin
who
was
pulling
off
his
pearly
coat
the
mental
exercises
in
which
we
propose
to
engage
do
not
require
gymnasium
but
ulfin
went
on
taking
off
his
coat
and
when
it
was
off
he
handed
it
to
the
princess
who
at
once
felt
in
its
inner
pocket
pulled
out
a
little
golden
case
and
held
it
toward
the
professor
it
has
been
well
said
that
no
charm
on
mean
strong
enough
to
make
one
forget
one
s
antidote
the
moment
the
professor
s
eye
fell
on
the
little
golden
case
he
held
out
his
hand
for
it
and
the
princess
gave
it
to
him
he
opened
it
and
without
hesitation
as
without
haste
swallowed
the
charm
next
moment
the
princess
was
clasped
in
his
arms
and
the
moment
after
that
still
clasped
there
was
beginning
a
hurried
explanation
but
he
stopped
her
i
know
my
child
i
know
he
said
you
have
brought
me
the
charm
which
gives
back
to
me
my
memory
and
makes
a
king
of
merland
out
of
a
professor
of
conchology
but
why
oh
why
did
you
not
bring
me
my
pearly
coat
said
the
king
it
was
in
the
case
with
the
no
one
had
thought
of
it
and
everyone
felt
and
looked
exceedingly
silly
and
no
one
spoke
till
ulfin
said
holding
out
the
coat
which
the
princess
had
given
back
to
you
will
have
this
coat
majesty
i
have
no
right
to
the
magic
garments
of
your
but
said
francis
you
need
the
coat
more
than
anybody
the
king
shall
have
shan
t
want
it
if
you
ll
let
me
go
and
ask
for
an
interview
with
the
king
of
the
under
no
have
mine
said
have
mine
said
bernard
and
the
princess
said
of
course
my
father
will
have
so
they
all
protested
at
once
but
the
king
raised
his
hand
and
there
was
silence
and
they
saw
that
he
no
longer
looked
only
a
noble
and
learned
gentleman
but
that
he
looked
every
inch
a
king
silence
he
said
if
anyone
speaks
with
the
king
and
queen
of
this
land
it
is
fitting
that
it
should
be
i
see
we
will
go
out
by
the
back
door
so
as
to
avoid
the
other
pupils
who
will
soon
be
arriving
in
their
thousands
for
my
conchology
course
is
very
popular
and
as
we
go
tell
me
who
is
this
man
of
the
under
folk
who
seems
to
be
one
of
you
i
am
the
princess
servant
ulfin
put
in
and
why
you
desire
to
speak
with
the
king
of
this
so
they
made
great
haste
to
go
out
by
the
back
way
so
as
not
to
meet
the
conchology
students
and
cautiously
crept
up
to
their
of
course
the
biggest
and
best
horse
was
given
to
the
king
to
ride
but
when
he
saw
how
awkwardly
their
false
tails
adapted
themselves
to
the
saddle
he
said
my
daughter
you
can
remove
these
how
said
she
my
shell
knife
won
t
cut
bite
through
the
strings
of
them
with
your
little
sharp
teeth
said
the
king
nothing
but
princess
teeth
is
sharp
enough
to
cut
through
them
no
my
is
not
degrading
a
true
princess
can
not
be
degraded
by
anything
that
is
for
the
good
of
her
subjects
and
her
so
the
mer
princess
willingly
bit
through
the
strings
of
the
false
everybody
put
on
his
or
her
proper
tail
again
with
great
comfort
and
they
all
swam
toward
the
town
and
as
they
went
they
heard
a
great
noise
of
shouting
and
saw
parties
of
under
folk
flying
as
if
in
fear
i
must
make
haste
said
the
king
and
see
to
it
that
our
peace
conference
be
not
too
late
they
hurried
on
and
the
noise
grew
louder
and
louder
and
the
crowds
of
flying
under
folk
thicker
and
fleeter
and
by
and
by
ulfin
made
them
stand
back
under
the
arch
of
the
astrologers
tower
to
see
what
it
was
from
which
they
fled
and
there
along
the
streets
of
the
great
city
of
the
under
folk
came
the
flash
of
swords
and
the
swirl
of
banners
and
the
army
of
the
mer
folk
came
along
between
the
great
buildings
of
their
foes
and
on
their
helmets
was
the
light
of
victory
and
at
their
head
proud
and
splendid
rode
the
princess
maia
reuben
we
re
saved
called
mavis
and
would
have
darted
out
but
francis
put
his
hand
over
her
mouth
stop
he
said
don
t
you
remember
we
promised
not
to
escape
without
the
queen
s
permission
quick
quick
to
the
palace
to
make
peace
before
our
armies
can
attack
you
speak
well
said
the
mer
king
and
ulfin
said
this
is
no
time
for
ceremony
quick
quick
i
will
take
you
in
by
the
tradesmen
s
and
turning
their
backs
on
that
splendid
and
victorious
procession
they
marched
to
the
back
entrance
of
the
royal
palace
chapter
twelve
the
queen
of
the
under
folk
sat
with
her
husband
on
their
throne
which
was
much
more
comfortable
than
their
state
one
though
not
so
handsome
their
sad
faces
were
lighted
up
with
pleasure
as
they
watched
the
gambols
of
their
new
pet
fido
a
dear
little
who
was
playing
with
a
ball
of
soft
pink
seaweed
patting
it
and
tossing
it
and
running
after
it
as
prettily
as
any
kitten
dear
little
fido
said
the
queen
come
here
then
and
fido
who
had
once
been
cathay
came
willingly
to
lean
against
the
queen
s
knee
and
be
stroked
and
petted
i
have
curious
dreams
sometimes
said
the
queen
to
the
king
dreams
so
vivid
that
they
are
more
like
has
it
ever
occurred
to
you
said
the
king
that
we
have
no
memories
of
our
childhood
of
our
i
believe
said
the
queen
slowly
that
we
have
tasted
in
our
time
of
the
there
is
no
one
like
us
in
this
land
if
we
were
born
here
why
can
we
not
remember
our
parents
who
must
have
been
like
us
and
dream
that
comes
to
me
most
often
is
that
we
once
had
a
child
and
lost
that
it
was
a
child
like
fido
said
the
king
in
a
low
voice
is
like
and
he
too
stroked
the
head
of
cathay
who
had
forgotten
everything
except
that
she
was
fido
and
bore
the
queen
s
name
on
her
collar
but
if
you
remember
that
we
had
a
child
it
can
not
be
we
drank
of
the
that
is
because
of
course
that
would
make
us
forget
it
could
not
make
a
mother
forget
her
child
said
the
queen
and
with
the
word
caught
up
and
kissed
her
nice
queen
purred
i
do
love
i
am
sure
we
had
a
child
once
said
the
queen
hugging
her
and
that
we
have
been
made
to
even
as
she
spoke
the
hangings
of
cloth
of
gold
pieced
together
from
the
spoil
of
lost
galleons
rustled
at
the
touch
of
someone
outside
the
queen
dried
her
eyes
which
needed
it
and
said
come
the
arras
was
lifted
and
a
tall
figure
entered
bless
my
soul
said
the
king
of
the
under
folk
it
s
the
professor
of
no
said
the
figure
advancing
it
is
the
king
of
the
my
brother
king
my
sister
queen
i
greet
this
is
most
irregular
said
the
king
never
mind
dear
said
the
queen
let
us
hear
what
his
majesty
has
to
i
there
be
peace
between
our
people
said
the
for
countless
ages
these
wars
have
been
waged
for
countless
ages
your
people
and
mine
have
suffered
even
the
origin
of
the
war
is
lost
in
the
mists
of
antiquity
now
i
come
to
you
i
your
was
given
to
drink
of
the
cup
of
oblivion
and
forgot
who
i
was
and
whence
i
came
now
a
has
given
me
back
mind
and
memory
i
come
in
the
name
of
my
people
if
we
have
wronged
you
we
ask
your
forgiveness
if
you
have
wronged
us
we
freely
forgive
you
say
shall
it
be
peace
and
shall
all
the
sons
of
the
sea
live
as
brothers
in
love
and
kindliness
for
evermore
really
said
the
king
of
the
under
folk
i
think
it
is
not
at
all
a
bad
in
confidence
and
between
monarchs
i
may
tell
you
sir
that
i
suspect
my
mind
is
not
what
it
was
you
sir
seem
to
possess
a
truly
royal
grasp
of
your
subject
my
mind
is
so
imperfect
that
i
dare
not
consult
it
but
my
your
heart
says
yes
said
the
queen
so
does
mine
but
our
troops
are
besieging
your
city
she
said
they
will
say
that
in
asking
for
peace
you
were
paying
the
tribute
of
the
my
people
will
not
think
this
of
me
said
the
king
of
merland
nor
would
your
people
think
it
of
you
let
us
join
hands
in
peace
and
the
love
of
royal
what
a
dreadful
noise
they
are
making
outside
said
the
king
and
indeed
the
noise
of
shouting
and
singing
was
now
to
be
heard
on
every
side
of
the
palace
if
there
was
a
balcony
now
where
we
could
show
ourselves
suggested
the
king
of
merland
the
very
thing
said
the
queen
catching
up
her
pet
in
her
arms
and
leading
the
way
to
the
great
curtained
arch
at
the
end
of
the
hall
she
drew
back
the
swinging
sweeping
hangings
of
woven
seaweed
and
stepped
forth
on
the
two
kings
close
behind
her
but
she
stopped
short
and
staggered
back
a
little
so
that
her
husband
had
to
put
an
arm
about
her
to
support
her
when
her
first
glance
showed
her
that
the
people
who
were
shouting
outside
the
palace
were
not
as
she
had
supposed
under
folk
in
some
unexpected
though
welcome
transport
of
loyal
enthusiasm
but
ranks
on
ranks
of
the
enemy
the
hated
mer
folk
all
splendid
and
menacing
in
the
pomp
and
circumstance
of
glorious
war
it
is
the
enemy
gasped
the
queen
it
is
my
people
said
the
mer
king
it
is
a
beautiful
thing
in
you
dear
queen
that
you
agreed
to
peace
without
terms
while
you
thought
you
were
victorious
and
not
because
the
legions
of
the
mer
folk
were
thundering
at
your
gates
may
i
speak
for
us
they
signed
assent
and
the
mer
king
stepped
forward
full
into
view
of
the
crowd
in
the
street
below
my
people
he
said
in
a
voice
loud
yet
soft
and
very
very
beautiful
and
at
the
words
the
mer
folk
below
looked
up
and
recognized
their
king
and
a
shout
went
up
that
you
could
have
heard
a
mile
away
the
king
raised
his
hand
for
silence
my
people
he
said
brave
men
of
there
be
peace
now
and
forever
between
us
and
our
brave
foes
the
king
and
queen
of
this
land
agreed
to
make
unconditional
peace
while
they
believed
themselves
to
be
victorious
if
victory
has
for
today
been
with
us
let
us
at
least
be
the
equals
of
our
foes
in
generosity
as
in
another
shout
rang
out
and
the
king
of
the
under
folk
stepped
forward
my
people
he
said
and
the
under
folk
came
quickly
forward
toward
him
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
there
shall
be
peace
let
these
who
were
your
foes
this
morning
be
your
guests
tonight
and
your
friends
and
brothers
for
evermore
if
we
have
wronged
them
we
beg
them
to
forgive
us
if
they
have
wronged
us
we
beg
them
to
allow
us
to
forgive
is
that
right
he
asked
the
mer
king
in
a
hasty
whisper
who
whispered
back
admirable
now
he
went
on
cheer
mer
folk
and
under
folk
for
the
splendid
compact
of
and
they
cheered
pardon
your
majesty
was
ulfin
who
it
was
the
stranger
francis
who
first
conceived
the
peace
true
said
the
mer
king
where
is
francis
but
francis
was
not
to
be
found
it
was
only
his
name
which
was
presented
to
the
people
from
the
balcony
he
himself
kept
his
pearly
coat
on
and
kept
the
invisibility
button
well
pressed
down
till
the
crowd
had
dispersed
to
ring
all
the
diving
bells
with
which
the
towers
of
the
city
were
so
handsomely
fitted
up
to
hang
the
city
with
a
thousand
seaweed
flags
and
to
illuminate
its
every
window
and
door
and
pinnacle
and
buttress
with
more
and
more
phosphorescent
fish
in
the
palace
was
a
banquet
for
the
kings
and
the
queen
and
the
princesses
and
the
three
children
and
also
reuben
was
called
from
the
command
of
his
sea
urchins
to
be
a
guest
at
the
royal
table
princess
freia
asked
that
an
invitation
might
be
sent
to
when
the
king
s
private
secretary
a
very
intelligent
cuttlefish
had
got
the
invitation
ready
handsomely
written
in
his
own
ink
it
was
discovered
that
no
ulfin
was
to
be
found
to
receive
it
it
was
a
glorious
banquet
the
only
blot
on
its
rapturous
splendor
was
the
fact
that
cathay
still
remained
fido
the
queen
s
her
eyes
were
still
those
cold
unremembering
eyes
which
her
brothers
and
sister
could
not
bear
to
meet
reuben
sat
at
the
right
hand
of
the
queen
and
from
the
moment
he
took
his
place
there
he
seemed
to
think
of
no
one
else
he
talked
with
her
sensibly
and
modestly
and
francis
remarked
that
during
his
stay
in
merland
reuben
had
learned
to
talk
as
you
do
and
not
in
the
language
of
gypsy
the
of
the
forces
of
the
under
folk
sat
at
the
left
hand
of
his
king
the
king
of
the
mer
folk
sat
between
his
happy
daughters
and
the
children
sat
together
between
the
chief
astrologer
and
the
curator
of
the
museum
of
foreign
curiosities
who
was
more
pleased
to
see
them
again
than
he
had
ever
expected
to
be
and
much
more
friendly
than
they
had
ever
hoped
to
find
him
everyone
was
extremely
happy
even
who
sat
on
the
queen
s
lap
and
was
fed
with
delicacies
from
the
queen
s
own
plate
it
was
at
about
the
middle
of
the
feast
just
after
everybody
had
drunk
the
health
of
the
two
amid
tempestuous
applause
that
a
whispered
behind
his
fin
to
the
under
folk
queen
certainly
she
said
show
him
and
the
person
who
was
shown
in
was
ulfin
and
he
carried
on
his
arm
a
pearly
coat
and
a
scaly
tail
he
sank
on
one
knee
and
held
them
up
to
the
mer
king
with
only
one
doubtful
deprecating
glance
at
the
curator
of
the
museum
of
foreign
curiosities
the
king
took
them
and
feeling
in
the
pocket
of
the
coat
drew
out
three
golden
cases
it
is
the
royal
prerogative
to
have
three
he
said
smilingly
to
the
queen
in
case
of
accidents
may
i
ask
your
majesty
s
permission
to
administer
one
of
them
to
your
majesty
s
little
pet
i
am
sure
you
are
longing
to
restore
her
to
her
brothers
and
her
the
queen
could
not
but
her
heart
was
sore
at
losing
the
little
of
whom
she
had
grown
so
fond
but
she
was
hoping
that
reuben
would
consent
to
let
her
adopt
him
and
be
more
to
her
than
many
fidos
she
administered
the
charm
herself
and
the
moment
cathay
had
swallowed
it
the
royal
arms
were
loosened
and
the
queen
expected
her
pet
to
fly
to
her
brothers
and
sister
but
to
cathay
it
was
as
though
only
an
instant
had
passed
since
she
came
into
that
hall
a
prisoner
so
that
when
suddenly
she
saw
her
brothers
and
sister
honored
guests
at
what
was
unmistakably
a
very
grand
and
happy
festival
and
found
herself
in
the
place
of
honor
on
the
very
lap
of
the
queen
she
only
snuggled
closer
to
that
royal
lady
and
called
out
very
loud
and
clear
hullo
mavis
here
s
a
jolly
transformation
scene
that
was
a
magic
drink
she
gave
us
and
it
s
made
everybody
jolly
and
am
glad
you
dear
queen
she
added
it
is
nice
of
you
to
nurse
so
everybody
was
pleased
only
princess
freia
looked
sad
and
puzzled
and
her
eyes
followed
ulfin
as
he
bowed
and
made
to
retire
from
the
royal
presence
he
had
almost
reached
the
door
when
she
spoke
quickly
in
the
royal
ear
that
was
next
to
her
oh
father
she
said
don
t
let
him
go
like
that
he
ought
to
be
at
the
banquet
we
couldn
t
have
done
anything
without
true
said
the
king
but
i
thought
he
had
been
invited
and
refused
said
the
princess
oh
call
him
back
i
ll
run
if
i
may
said
mavis
slipping
out
of
her
place
and
running
down
the
great
hall
if
you
ll
sit
a
little
nearer
to
me
father
said
maia
obligingly
the
young
man
can
sit
between
you
and
my
so
that
is
where
ulfin
found
himself
and
that
was
where
he
had
never
dared
to
hope
to
be
the
banquet
was
a
strange
as
well
as
a
magnificent
of
course
the
were
beautiful
as
the
day
the
five
children
were
quite
as
pretty
as
any
five
children
have
any
need
to
be
and
the
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
were
as
handsome
as
handsome
so
that
all
this
handsomeness
was
a
very
curious
contrast
to
the
strange
heavy
features
of
the
under
folk
who
now
sat
at
table
so
pleasant
and
friendly
toasting
their
late
enemies
the
contrast
between
the
princess
freia
and
ulfin
was
particularly
marked
for
their
heads
bent
near
together
as
they
talked
princess
he
was
saying
tomorrow
you
will
go
back
to
your
kingdom
and
i
shall
never
see
you
the
princess
could
not
think
of
anything
to
say
because
it
seemed
to
her
that
what
he
said
was
true
but
he
went
on
i
shall
be
glad
all
my
life
to
have
known
and
loved
so
dear
and
beautiful
a
and
again
the
princess
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
princess
he
said
tell
me
one
thing
do
you
know
what
i
should
say
to
you
if
i
were
a
prince
yes
said
freia
i
know
what
you
would
say
and
i
know
what
i
should
answer
dear
ulfin
if
you
were
only
a
commoner
of
merland
i
mean
you
know
if
your
face
were
like
ours
but
since
you
are
of
the
under
folk
and
i
am
a
mermaid
i
can
only
say
that
i
will
never
forget
you
and
that
i
will
never
marry
anyone
is
it
only
my
face
then
that
prevents
your
marrying
me
he
asked
with
abrupt
eagerness
and
she
answered
gently
of
then
ulfin
sprang
to
his
feet
your
majesties
he
cried
and
lord
high
astrologer
has
not
the
moment
come
when
since
we
are
at
a
banquet
with
friends
we
may
unmask
the
strangers
exchanged
wondering
glances
the
sovereigns
and
the
astrologers
made
gestures
of
with
a
rustling
and
a
rattling
helmets
were
unlaced
and
corselets
unbuckled
the
under
folk
seemed
to
the
as
though
they
were
taking
off
their
very
skins
but
really
what
they
took
off
was
but
their
thick
scaly
armor
and
under
it
they
were
as
softly
and
richly
clad
and
as
personable
people
as
the
mer
folk
themselves
but
said
maia
how
splendid
we
thought
you
were
always
in
it
grew
on
you
you
the
under
folk
laughed
jollily
of
course
it
was
always
on
you
saw
us
we
were
always
at
and
you
re
just
like
us
said
freia
to
ulfin
there
is
no
one
like
you
he
whispered
back
ulfin
was
now
a
handsome
young
man
and
looked
much
more
like
a
prince
than
a
great
many
real
princes
do
did
you
mean
what
you
said
just
now
the
princess
whispered
and
for
answer
ulfin
dared
to
touch
her
hand
with
soft
firm
fingers
papa
said
freia
please
may
i
marry
ulfin
by
all
means
said
the
king
and
immediately
announced
the
engagement
joining
their
hands
and
giving
them
his
blessing
in
the
most
businesslike
way
then
said
the
queen
of
the
under
folk
why
should
not
these
two
reign
over
the
under
folk
and
let
us
two
be
allowed
to
remember
the
things
we
have
forgotten
and
go
back
to
that
other
life
which
i
know
we
had
we
had
a
i
think
said
mavis
that
now
everything
s
settled
so
comfortably
we
ought
perhaps
all
of
us
to
be
thinking
about
getting
i
have
only
one
charm
left
unfortunately
said
the
mer
king
but
if
your
people
will
agree
to
your
abdicating
i
will
divide
it
between
you
with
pleasure
dear
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
and
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
half
which
you
will
each
of
you
have
will
be
just
enough
to
counteract
your
memories
of
this
place
and
restore
to
you
all
the
memories
of
your
other
could
not
reuben
go
with
us
the
queen
asked
no
said
the
mer
king
but
he
shall
follow
you
to
earth
and
that
the
astrologer
royal
who
had
been
whispering
to
reuben
here
interposed
it
would
be
well
your
majesties
he
said
if
a
small
allowance
of
the
cup
of
oblivion
were
served
out
to
these
land
children
so
that
they
may
not
remember
their
adventures
here
it
is
not
well
for
the
earth
people
to
know
too
much
of
the
dwellers
in
the
sea
there
is
a
sacred
vessel
which
has
long
been
preserved
among
the
civic
plate
i
propose
that
this
vessel
should
be
presented
to
our
guests
as
a
mark
of
our
esteem
that
they
shall
bear
it
with
them
and
drink
the
contents
as
soon
as
they
set
foot
on
their
own
he
was
at
once
sent
to
fetch
the
sacred
vessel
it
was
a
stone
ginger
beer
bottle
i
do
really
think
we
ought
to
go
said
mavis
again
there
were
farewells
to
be
very
loving
farewell
to
the
princesses
a
very
friendly
one
to
the
fortunate
ulfin
and
then
a
little
party
left
the
palace
quietly
and
for
the
last
time
made
the
journey
to
the
quiet
iswater
where
the
king
of
merland
had
so
long
professed
conchology
arrived
at
this
spot
the
king
spoke
to
the
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
swallow
this
charm
he
said
in
equal
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
lake
and
say
the
charm
which
i
perceive
the
earth
children
have
taught
you
as
we
came
along
the
rest
will
be
easy
and
beautiful
we
shall
never
forget
you
and
your
hearts
will
remember
us
though
your
minds
must
forget
the
king
and
queen
rose
through
the
waters
and
disappeared
next
moment
a
strong
attraction
like
that
which
needles
feel
for
magnets
drew
the
children
from
the
side
of
the
mer
king
they
shut
their
eyes
and
when
they
opened
them
they
were
on
dry
land
in
a
wood
by
a
francis
had
a
ginger
beer
bottle
in
his
hand
the
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
must
have
said
at
once
the
charm
to
recall
the
children
to
earth
it
works
more
slowly
on
land
the
astrologer
said
reuben
remarked
before
we
drink
and
forget
everything
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
think
you
ve
all
been
real
bricks
to
me
and
if
you
don
t
mind
i
ll
take
off
these
girls
he
did
appearing
in
shirt
and
knickerbockers
he
said
shaking
hands
with
everyone
but
aren
t
you
coming
home
with
us
no
he
said
the
astrologer
told
me
the
first
man
and
woman
i
should
see
on
land
would
be
my
father
and
mother
and
i
was
to
go
straight
to
them
with
my
little
shirt
and
my
little
shoe
that
i
ve
kept
all
this
time
the
ones
that
were
mine
when
i
was
a
stolen
baby
and
they
d
know
me
and
i
should
belong
to
them
but
i
hope
we
ll
meet
again
some
day
and
thank
you
it
was
ripping
being
general
of
the
sea
with
that
they
drank
each
a
draught
from
the
ginger
beer
bottle
and
then
making
haste
to
act
before
the
should
blot
out
with
other
things
the
astrologer
s
advice
reuben
went
out
of
the
wood
into
the
sunshine
and
across
a
green
turf
they
saw
him
speak
to
a
man
and
a
woman
in
blue
bathing
dresses
who
seemed
to
have
been
swimming
in
the
lake
and
now
were
resting
on
the
marble
steps
that
led
down
to
it
he
held
out
the
little
shirt
and
the
little
shoe
and
they
held
their
hands
out
to
him
and
as
they
turned
the
children
saw
that
their
faces
were
the
faces
of
the
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
only
now
not
sad
anymore
but
radiant
with
happiness
because
they
had

all
that
happened
to
them
just
in
the
minute
they
were
and
reuben
is
really
their
heir
they
seemed
to
think
so
i
expect
he
s
exactly
like
an
ancestor
or
something
and
you
know
how
the
queen
took
to
him
from
the

then

forever
the
wonderful
world
that
they
had
known
underseas
and
sabrina
fair
and
the
circus
and
the
mermaid
whom
they
had
rescued
but
reuben
curiously
enough
they
did
not
forget
they
went
home
to
tea
with
a
pleasant
story
for
their
father
and
mother
of
a
spangled
boy
at
the
circus
who
had
run
away
and
found
his
father
and
mother
and
two
days
after
a
motor
stopped
at
their
gate
and

my
father
and
mother

ve
come

thank
you
for
the
plum
pie
and
things

you
ever
get

plate
and

of
the
bush

father
and

ended
proudly

children

and
looked
once
more
in
the
faces
of
the
king
and
queen
of
the
under
folk
but
now
they
did
not
know
those
faces
which

to
them

faces
of

very
nice
strangers
