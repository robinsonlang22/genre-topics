only
when
the
sailed
from
did
her
terrible
sense
of
foreboding
begin
to
subside
for
four
years
waking
or
sleeping
the
awful
subconsciousness
of
supreme
evil
had
never
left
her
but
now
as
the
korean
shore
receding
into
darkness
grew
dimmer
and
dimmer
fear
subsided
and
grew
vague
as
the
memory
of
horror
in
a
dream
she
stood
near
the
steamer
stern
apart
from
other
passengers
a
slender
lonely
figure
in
her
furs
her
ulster
and
smart
little
hat
watching
the
lights
of
grow
paler
and
smaller
along
the
horizon
until
they
looked
like
a
level
row
of
stars
under
her
haunted
eyes
asia
was
slowly
dissolving
to
a
streak
of
vapour
in
the
misty
lustre
of
the
moon
suddenly
the
ancient
continent
disappeared
washed
out
by
a
wave
against
the
sky
and
with
it
vanished
the
last
shreds
of
that
accursed
nightmare
which
had
possessed
her
for
four
endless
years
but
whether
during
those
unreal
years
her
soul
had
only
been
held
in
bondage
or
whether
as
she
had
been
taught
it
had
been
irrevocably
destroyed
she
still
remained
uncertain
knowing
nothing
about
the
death
of
souls
or
how
it
was
accomplished
as
she
stood
there
her
sad
eyes
fixed
on
the
misty
east
a
passenger
passing
an
englishwoman
paused
to
say
something
kind
to
the
young
american
and
added
if
there
is
anything
my
husband
and
i
can
do
it
would
give
us
much
pleasure
the
girl
had
turned
her
head
as
though
not
comprehending
the
other
woman
hesitated
this
is
doctor
norne
daughter
is
it
not
she
inquired
in
a
pleasant
voice
yes
i
am
tressa
norne
i
ask
your
pardon
thank
you
madam
i
am
i
seem
to
be
a
trifle
dazed
what
wonder
you
poor
child
come
to
us
if
you
feel
need
of
companionship
you
are
very
kind
i
seem
to
wish
to
be
alone
somehow
i
understand
my
dear
late
the
next
morning
tressa
norne
awoke
conscious
for
the
first
time
in
four
years
that
it
was
at
last
her
own
familiar
self
stretched
out
there
on
the
pillows
where
sunshine
streamed
through
the
porthole
all
that
day
she
lay
in
her
bamboo
steamer
chair
on
deck
sun
and
wind
conspired
to
dry
every
tear
that
wet
her
closed
lashes
her
dark
glossy
hair
blew
about
her
face
scarlet
tinted
her
full
lips
again
the
tense
hands
relaxed
peace
came
at
sundown
that
evening
she
took
her
from
her
cabin
and
found
a
chair
on
the
deserted
hurricane
deck
and
here
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
of
the
china
sea
she
curled
up
on
the
deck
all
alone
and
sounded
the
four
futile
strings
of
her
and
hummed
to
herself
in
a
still
voice
old
songs
she
had
sung
in
yian
before
the
tragedy
she
sang
the
called
she
sang
and
blue
songs
of
the
yiort
she
sang
the
ancient
khiounnou
song
called
the
saghalien
the
month
of
saffar
among
the
i
saw
two
horsemen
sitting
on
their
steeds
tulugum

by
the

a
demon
guards
the

my
lover
draw
your
shining
sword

him
with
your
sword
the
month
of

among
the
i
saw
two
horsemen
fighting
on
their
steeds

how
my
lover
bleeds
the
month
of
saffar
the
year
i
should
have
wed
the
year
of
the
panther
my
lover
lay
dead
tulugum
heitulum
dead
without
a
and
songs
like
these
the
one
called
keuke
mongol
and
an
ancient
air
of
the
tchortchas
called
the
thirty
thousand
calamities
and
some
chinese
boatmen
songs
which
she
had
heard
in
yian
before
the
tragedy
these
she
hummed
to
herself
there
in
the
moonlight
playing
on
her
lute
of
four
strings
terror
indeed
seemed
ended
for
her
and
in
her
heart
a
great
overwhelming
joy
was
welling
up
which
seemed
to
overflow
across
the
entire
moonlit
world
she
had
no
longer
any
fear
no
premonition
of
further
evil
among
the
few
americans
and
english
aboard
something
of
her
story
was
already
known
people
were
kind
and
they
were
also
considerate
enough
to
subdue
their
sympathetic
curiosity
when
they
discovered
that
this
young
american
girl
shrank
from
any
mention
of
what
had
happened
to
her
during
the
last
four
years
of
the
great
world
war
it
was
evident
also
that
she
preferred
to
remain
aloof
and
this
inclination
when
finally
understood
was
respected
by
her
fellow
passengers
the
clever
efficient
and
polite
japanese
officers
and
crew
of
the
were
invariably
considerate
and
courteous
to
her
and
they
remained
nicely
reticent
although
they
also
knew
the
main
outline
of
her
story
and
very
much
desired
to
know
more
and
so
surrounded
now
by
the
friendly
security
of
civilised
humanity
tressa
norne
reborn
to
light
out
of
hell
own
shadows
awoke
from
four
years
of
nightmare
which
after
all
perhaps
never
had
seemed
entirely
actual
and
now
god
real
sun
warmed
her
by
day
his
real
moon
bathed
her
in
creamy
coolness
by
night
sky
and
wind
and
wave
thrilled
her
with
their
blessed
assurance
that
this
was
once
more
the
real
world
which
stretched
illimitably
on
every
side
from
horizon
to
horizon
and
the
fair
faces
and
pleasant
voices
of
her
own
countrymen
made
the
past
seem
only
a
ghastly
dream
that
never
again
could
enmesh
her
soul
with
its
web
of
sorcery
and
now
the
days
at
sea
fled
very
swiftly
and
when
at
last
the
golden
gate
was
not
far
away
she
had
finally
managed
to
persuade
herself
that
nothing
really
can
harm
the
human
soul
that
the
monstrous
were
ended
never
again
to
return
that
in
this
vast
clean
western
continent
there
could
be
no
occult
threat
to
dread
no
gigantic
menace
to
destroy
her
body
no
secret
power
that
could
consign
her
soul
to
the
dreadful
abysm
of
spiritual
annihilation
very
early
that
morning
she
came
on
deck
the
november
day
was
delightfully
warm
the
air
clear
save
for
a
belt
of
mist
low
on
the
water
to
the
southward
she
had
been
told
that
land
would
not
be
sighted
for
hours
but
she
went
forward
and
stood
beside
the
starboard
rail
searching
the
horizon
with
the
enchanted
eyes
of
hope
as
she
stood
there
a
japanese
ship
officer
crossing
the
deck
forward
halted
abruptly
and
stood
staring
at
something
to
the
southward
at
the
same
moment
above
the
belt
of
mist
on
the
water
and
perfectly
clear
against
the
blue
sky
above
the
girl
saw
a
fountain
of
gold
fire
rise
from
the
fog
drift
upward
in
the
daylight
slowly
assume
the
incandescent
outline
of
a
serpentine
creature
which
leisurely
uncoiled
and
hung
there
floating
its
undulating
its
feet
with
their
five
stumpy
claws
closing
relaxing
like
those
of
a
living
reptile
for
a
full
minute
this
amazing
shape
of
fire
floated
there
in
the
sky
brilliant
in
the
morning
light
then
the
reptilian
form
faded
died
out
and
the
last
spark
vanished
in
the
sunshine
when
the
japanese
officer
at
last
turned
to
resume
his
promenade
he
noticed
a
girl
gripping
a
stanchion
behind
him
as
though
she
were
on
the
point
of
swooning
he
crossed
the
deck
quickly
tressa
norne
eyes
opened
are
you
ill
miss
norne
he
asked
the
the
dragon
she
whispered
the
officer
laughed
why
that
was
nothing
but
chinese
he
explained
the
crew
of
some
fishing
boat
yonder
in
the
fog
is
amusing
itself
he
looked
at
her
narrowly
then
with
a
nice
little
bow
and
smile
he
offered
his
arm
if
you
are
indisposed
perhaps
you
might
wish
to
go
below
to
your
stateroom
miss
norne
she
thanked
him
managed
to
pull
herself
together
and
force
a
ghost
of
a
smile
he
lingered
a
moment
said
something
cheerful
about
being
nearly
home
then
made
her
a
punctilious
salute
and
went
his
way
tressa
norne
leaned
back
against
the
stanchion
and
closed
her
eyes
her
pallor
became
deathly
she
bent
over
and
laid
her
white
face
in
her
folded
arms
after
a
while
she
lifted
her
head
and
turning
very
slowly
stared
at
the
out
of
frightened
eyes
and
saw
rising
out
of
the
fog
a
sphere
which
gradually
mounted
into
the
clear
daylight
above
like
the
full
moon
phantom
in
the
sky
higher
higher
rose
the
spectral
moon
until
at
last
it
swam
in
the
very
zenith
then
it
slowly
evaporated
in
the
blue
vault
above
a
great
wave
of
despair
swept
her
she
clung
to
the
stanchion
staring
with
eyes
at
the
flat
in
the
south
but
no
more
chinese
rose
out
of
it
and
at
length
she
summoned
sufficient
strength
to
go
below
to
her
cabin
and
lie
there
half
senseless
huddled
on
her
bed
when
land
was
sighted
the
following
morning
tressa
norne
had
lived
a
century
in
hours
and
in
that
space
of
time
her
agonised
soul
had
touched
all
depths
but
now
as
the
golden
gate
loomed
up
in
the
morning
light
rage
terror
despair
had
burned
themselves
out
from
their
ashes
within
her
mind
arose
the
cool
wrath
of
desperation
armed
for
anything
wary
alert
passionately
determined
to
survive
at
whatever
cost
recklessly
ready
to
fight
for
bodily
existence
that
was
her
sole
instinct
now
to
go
on
living
to
survive
no
matter
at
what
price
and
if
it
were
indeed
true
that
her
soul
had
been
slain
she
defied
its
murderers
to
slay
her
body
also
that
night
at
her
hotel
in
san
francisco
she
her
door
and
lay
down
without
undressing
leaving
all
lights
burning
and
an
automatic
pistol
underneath
her
pillow
toward
morning
she
fell
asleep
slept
for
an
hour
started
up
in
awful
fear
and
saw
the
door
opposite
the
foot
of
her
bed
slowly
opening
of
its
own
accord
into
the
brightly
illuminated
room
stepped
a
graceful
young
man
in
full
evening
dress
carrying
over
his
left
arm
an
overcoat
and
in
his
other
hand
a
top
hat
and
silver
tipped
with
one
bound
the
girl
swung
herself
from
the
bed
to
the
carpet
and
clutched
at
the
pistol
under
her
pillow
sanang
she
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
keuke
mongol
he
said
smilingly
for
a
moment
they
confronted
each
other
in
the
brightly
lighted
bedroom
then
partly
turning
he
cast
a
calm
glance
at
the
open
door
behind
him
and
as
though
moved
by
a
wind
the
door
slowly
closed
and
she
heard
the
key
turn
of
itself
in
the
lock
and
saw
the
bolt
slide
smoothly
into
place
again
her
power
of
speech
came
back
to
her
presently
only
a
broken
whisper
at
first
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
your
accursed
magic
she
managed
to
gasp
do
you
think
i
am
afraid
of
you
sanang
you
are
afraid
he
said
serenely
you
lie
no
i
do
not
lie
to
one
another
the
yezidees
never
lie
you
lie
again
assassin
i
am
no
yezidee
he
smiled
gently
his
features
were
pleasing
smooth
and
regular
his
high
his
skin
fine
and
of
a
pale
and
delicate
ivory
colour
once
his
black
beautifully
shaped
eyes
wandered
to
the
levelled
pistol
which
she
now
held
clutched
desperately
close
to
her
right
hip
and
a
slightly
ironical
expression
veiled
his
gaze
for
an
instant
bullets
he
murmured
but
you
and
i
are
of
the
hassanis
the
third
lie
sanang
her
voice
had
regained
its
strength
tense
alert
blue
eyes
ablaze
every
faculty
concentrated
on
the
terrible
business
before
her
the
girl
now
seemed
like
some
supple
leopardess
poised
on
the
swift
verge
of
murder
tokhta
she
spat
the
word
any
movement
toward
a
hidden
weapon
any
gesture
suggesting
recourse
to
magic
and
i
kill
you
sanang
exactly
where
you
stand
footnote
look
out
dialect
with
a
pistol
he
laughed
then
his
smooth
features
altered
subtly
he
said
keuke
mongol
who
call
yourself
tressa
norne
keuke
heavenly
named
so
in
the
temple
because
of
the
colour
of
your
eyes

attentively
for
this
is
the
yarlig
which
i
bring
to
you
by
word
of
mouth
from
yian
as
from

to

here
in
this
land
called
the
united
states
of
america
the
temple
girl
keuke
mongol
who
has
witnessed
the
mysteries
of
erlik
and
who
understands
the
magic
of
the
and
who
has
seen
mount
alamout
and
the
eight
castles
and
the
fifty
thousand
hassanis
in
white
turbans
and
in
robes
of
white
eyes
heed
the
yarlig
or
may
thirty
thousand
calamities
overtake
you
there
was
a
dead
silence
then
he
went
on
seriously
it
is
decreed
you
shall
cease
to
remember
that
you
are
a
yezidee
that
you
are
of
the
hassanis
that
you
ever
have
laid
eyes
on
yian
the
beautiful
that
you
ever
set
naked
foot
upon
mount
alamout
it
is
decreed
that
you
remember
nothing
of
what
you
have
seen
and
heard
of
what
has
been
told
and
taught
during
the
last
four
years
reckoned
as
the
christians
reckon
from
our
year
of
the
bull
otherwise
my
master
sends
you
this
for
your
leisurely
from
under
his
folded
overcoat
the
young
man
produced
a
roll
of
white
cloth
and
dropped
it
at
her
feet
and
the
girl
shrank
aside
shuddering
knowing
that
the
roll
of
white
cloth
was
meant
for
her
then
the
colour
came
back
to
lip
and
cheek
and
glancing
up
from
the
soft
white
shroud
she
smiled
at
the
young
man
have
you
ended
your
oriental
mummery
she
asked
calmly
listen
very
seriously
in
your
turn
sanang
prince
of
the
hassanis
who
god
knows
when
and
how
have
come
out
into
the
sunshine
of
this
clean
and
decent
country
out
of
a
filthy
darkness
where
devils
and
sorcerers
make
earth
a
hell
if
you
or
yours
threaten
me
annoy
me
interfere
with
me
i
shall
go
to
our
civilised
police
and
tell
all
i
know
concerning
the
yezidees
i
mean
to
live
do
you
understand
you
know
what
you
have
done
to
me
and
mine
i
come
back
to
my
own
country
alone
without
any
living
kin
poor
homeless
friendless
and
perhaps
damned
i
intend
nevertheless
to
survive
i
shall
not
relax
my
clutch
on
bodily
existence
whatever
the
yezidees
may
pretend
to
have
done
to
my
soul
i
am
determined
to
live
in
the
body
anyway
he
nodded
gravely
she
said
out
at
sea
over
the
fog
i
saw
the
sign
of
in
fire
floating
in
the
i
saw
his
spectral
moon
rise
and
vanish
in
i
understood
but
and
here
she
suddenly
showed
an
edge
of
teeth
under
the
full
scarlet
upper
lip
keep

signs
and
your
shrouds

messages

magic
than

you
sanang
death
adder
of
alamout
suddenly
she
laughed
aloud
at
him
laughed
insultingly
in
his
expressionless
face
i
saw
you
and
gutchlug
khan
and
your
cowardly
tchortchas
in
jackets
slink
out
of
the
temple
of
erlik
where
the
bronze
gong
thundered
and
a
cloud
settled
down
raining
little
yellow
snakes
all
over
the
marble
steps
all
over
you
prince
sanang
you
were
my
tougtchi
you
and
gutchlug
and
your
red
tchortchas
with
their
halberds
all
dripping
with
human
entrails
and
i
saw
you
mount
and
gallop
off
into
the
woods
while
in
the
depths
of
the
magic
cloud
which
rained
little
yellow
snakes
all
around
you
we
temple
girls
laughed
and
mocked
at
you
at
you
and
your
cowardly
tchortcha
horsemen
a
slight
tinge
of
pink
came
into
the
young
man
pale
face
tressa
norne
stepped
nearer
her
levelled
pistol
resting
on
her
hip
why
did
you
not
complain
of
us
to
your
master
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
she
asked
jeeringly
and
where
also
was
your
yezidee
magic
when
it
rained
little
snakes
what
frightened
you
away
who
had
boldly
come
to
seize
a
temple
girl
you
who
had
screwed
up
your
courage
sufficiently
to
defy
erlik
in
his
very
shrine
and
snatch
from
his
temple
a
young
thing
whose
naked
body
wrapped
in
gold
was
worth
the
chance
of
death
to
you
the
young
man
dropped
to
the
floor
he
bent
over
to
pick
it
up
his
face
was
quite
expressionless
quite
colourless
now
i
went
on
no
such
errand
he
said
with
an
effort
i
went
with
a
thousand
prayers
on
scarlet
paper
made
in
a
lie
yezidee
you
came
to
seize
he
turned
still
paler
by
abu
omar
otman
and
ali
it
is
not
true
you
lie
by
the
lion
of
god
hassini
she
stepped
closer
and
i
tell
you
another
thing
you
fear
you
yezidee
of
alamout
you
robber
of
yian
you
sorcerer
of
sabbah
khan
and
chief
of
his
sect
of
assassins
you
fear
this
native
land
of
mine
america
and
its
laws
and
customs
and
its
clear
clean
sunshine
and
its
cities
and
people
and
its
police
take
that
message
back
we
americans
fear
nobody
save
the
true
god
nobody
neither
yezidee
nor
hassani
nor
russ
nor
german
nor
that
sexless
monster
born
of
hell
and
called
the
bolshevik
tokhta
he
cried
sharply
damn

retorted
the
girl

out
of
my
room
get
out
of
my
sight
get
out
of
my
path
get
out
of
my
life
take
that
to
your
master
of
mount
alamout
i
do
what
i
please
i
go
where
i
please
i
live
as
i
please
and
if
i
please
turn
against
in
that
event
he
said
hoarsely
there
lies
your
on
the
floor
at
your
feet
take
up
your
shroud
and
make
erlik
seize
you
sanang
she
said
very
seriously
i
hear
you
listen
attentively
i
wish
to
live
i
have
had
enough
of
death
in
life
i
desire
to
remain
a
living
breathing
thing
even
if
it
be
true
as
you
yezidees
tell
me
that
you
have
caught
my
soul
in
a
net
and
that
your
sorcerers
really
control
its
destiny
but
damned
or
not
i
passionately
desire
to
live
and
i
am
coward
enough
to
hold
my
peace
for
the
sake
of
living
so
i
remain
silent
i
have
no
stomach
to
defy
the
yezidees
because
if
i
do
sooner
or
later
i
shall
be
killed
i
know
it
i
have
no
desire
to
die
for
others
to
perish
for
the
sake
of
the
common
good
i
am
young
i
have
suffered
too
much
i
am
determined
to
live
and
let
my
soul
take
its
chances
between
god
and
erlik
she
came
close
to
him
looked
curiously
into
his
pale
face
i
laughed
at
you
out
of
the
temple
cloud
she
said
i
know
how
to
open
bolted
doors
as
well
as
you
do
and
i
know
and
if
you
ever
again
come
to
me
in
this
life
i
shall
first
torture
you
then
slay
you
then
i
shall
tell
all
and
unroll
my
shroud
i
keep
your
word
of
promise
until
you
break
it
he
interrupted
hastily
yarlig
it
is
decreed
and
then
he
slowly
turned
as
though
to
glance
over
his
shoulder
at
the
locked
and
bolted
door
permit
me
to
open
it
for
you
prince
sanang
said
the
girl
scornfully
and
she
gazed
steadily
at
the
door
presently
all
by
itself
the
key
turned
in
the
lock
the
bolt
slid
back
the
door
gently
opened
toward
it
white
as
a
corpse
his
overcoat
on
his
left
arm
his
stick
and
in
the
other
hand
crept
the
young
man
in
his
faultless
evening
garb
then
as
he
reached
the
threshold
he
suddenly
sprang
aside
a
small
yellow
snake
lay
coiled
there
on
the
door
sill
for
a
full
throbbing
minute
the
young
man
stared
at
the
yellow
reptile
in
unfeigned
horror
then
very
cautiously
he
moved
his
fascinated
eyes
sideways
and
gazed
in
silence
at
tressa
norne
the
girl
laughed
sorceress
he
burst
out
hoarsely
take
that
accursed
thing
from
my
path
what
thing
sanang
at
that
his
dark
frightened
eyes
stole
toward
the
threshold
again
seeking
the
little
snake
but
there
was
no
snake
there
and
when
he
was
certain
of
this
he
went
twitching
and
trembling
all
over
behind
him
the
door
closed
softly
locking
and
bolting
itself
and
behind
the
bolted
door
in
the
brightly
lighted
bedroom
tressa
norne
fell
on
both
knees
her
pistol
still
clutched
in
her
right
hand
calling
passionately
upon
christ
to
forgive
her
for
the
dreadful
ability
she
had
dared
to
use
and
begging
him
to
save
her
body
from
death
and
her
soul
from
the
snare
of
the
yezidee
chapter
ii
the
yellow
snake
when
the
young
man
named
sanang
left
the
of
tressa
norne
he
turned
to
the
right
in
the
carpeted
corridor
outside
and
hurried
toward
the
hotel
elevator
but
he
did
not
ring
for
the
lift
instead
he
took
the
spiral
iron
stairway
which
circled
it
and
mounted
hastily
to
the
floor
above
here
was
his
own
apartment
and
he
entered
it
with
a
key
bearing
the
hotel
tag
a
powerful
old
man
wearing
a
grizzled
beard
and
a
greasy
broadcloth
coat
of
cut
known
to
provincials
as
a
prince
albert
looked
up
from
where
he
was
seated
upon
the
sofa
sharpening
a
curved
knife
on
a
whetstone
gutchlug
stammered
sanang
i
am
afraid
of
her
what
happened
two
years
ago
at
the
temple
happened
again
a
moment
since
there
in
her
very
bedroom
she
made
a
yellow
out
of
nothing
and
placed
it
upon
the
threshold
and
mocked
me
with
laughter
may
thirty
thousand
calamities
overtake
her
may
erlik
seize
her
may
her
eyes
rot
out
and
her
limbs
fester
may
the
seven
score
and
three
principal
devils
you
chatter
like
a
temple
ape
said
gutchlug
tranquilly
does
keuke
mongol
die
or
live
that
alone
interests
me
gutchlug
faltered
the
young
man
thou
knowest
that
heart
is
inclined
to
mercy
toward
this
young
yezidee
i
know
that
it
is
inclined
to
lust
said
the
other
bluntly
sanang
pale
face
flamed
listen
he
said
if
i
had
not
loved
her
better
than
life
had
i
dared
go
that
day
to
the
temple
to
take
her
for
my
own
you
loved
life
better
said
gutchlug
you
fled
when
it
rained
snakes
on
the
temple
steps
you
and
your
tchortcha
horsemen
kai
i
also
ran
but
i
gave
every
soldier
thirty
blows
with
a
stick
before
i
slept
that
night
and
you
should
have
had
your
thirty
also
conforming
to
the
yarlig
my
tougtchi
sanang
still
holding
his
hat
and
cane
and
carrying
his
overcoat
over
his
left
arm
looked
down
at
the
heavy
brutal
features
of
gutchlug
khan
at
the
cruel
mouth
with
its
crooked
smile
under
the
grizzled
beard
at
the
huge
hands
the
powerful
hands
of
a
murderer
now
deftly
honing
to
a
the
kalmuck
knife
held
so
firmly
yet
lightly
in
his
great
blunt
fingers
listen
attentively
prince
sanang
growled
gutchlug
pausing
in
his
monotonous
task
to
test
the
blade
edge
on
his
thumb
does
the
yezidee
keuke
mongol
live
yes
or
no
sanang
hesitated
moistened
his
pallid
lips
she
dares
not
betray
us
by
what
pledge
fear
that
is
no
pledge
you
also
were
afraid
yet
you
went
to
the
temple
she
has
listened
to
the
yarlig
she
has
looked
upon
her
shroud
she
has
admitted
that
she
desires
to
live
therein
lies
her
pledge
to
us
and
she
placed
a
yellow
snake
at
your
feet
sneered
gutchlug
prince
sanang
tell
me
what
man
or
what
devil
in
all
the
chronicles
of
the
past
has
ever
tamed
a
and
he
continued
to
hone
his
yataghan
gutchlug
no
she
dies
said
the
other
tranquilly
not
yet
when
then
gutchlug
thou
knowest
me
hear
my
pledge
at
her
first
gesture
toward
treachery
her
first
thought
of
betrayal
i
myself
will
end
it
all
you
promise
to
slay
this
young
by
the
four
companions
i
swear
to
kill
her
with
my
own
hands
gutchlug
sneered
kill
her
yes
with
the
kiss
that
has
burned
thy
lips
to
ashes
for
all
these
months
i
know
thee
sanang
leave
her
to
me
dead
she
will
no
longer
trouble
thee
gutchlug
i
hear
prince
sanang
strike
when
i
nod
not
until
then
i
hear
tougtchi
i
understand
thee
my
banneret
i
whet
my
knife
kai
sanang
looked
at
him
put
on
his
and
overcoat
pulled
on
a
pair
of
white
evening
gloves
i
go
forth
he
said
more
pleasantly
i
remain
here
to
talk
to
my
seven
ancestors
and
sharpen
my
knife
remarked
gutchlug
when
the
white
world
and
the
yellow
world
and
the
brown
world
and
the
black
world
finally
fall
before
the
hassanis
said
sanang
with
a
quick
smile
i
shall
bring
thee
to
her
gutchlug
once
before
she
is
veiled
thou
shalt
behold
what
is
lovelier
than

the
other
stolidly
whetted
his
knife
sanang
pulled
out
a
gold
cigarette
case
lighted
a
cigarette
with
an
air
i
go
among
germans
he
volunteered
amiably
the
huns

across
two
oceans
but
like
the
unclean
swine
it
is
their
own
throats
they
cut
when
they
swim
well
there
is
only
one
god
and
not
very
many
angels
erlik

greater
and
there
are
many
million
devils
to
do
his
bidding
adieu
there
is
rice
and
there
is
koumiss
in
the
frozen
closet
when
i
return
you
shall
have
been
asleep
for
hours
when
sanang
left
the
hotel
one
of
two
young
men
seated
in
the
hotel
lobby
got
up
and
strolled
out
after
him
a
few
minutes
later
the
other
man
went
to
the
elevator
ascended
to
the
fourth
floor
and
entered
an
apartment
next
to
the
one
occupied
by
sanang
there
was
another
man
there
lying
on
the
lounge
and
smoking
a
cigar
without
a
word
they
both
went
leisurely
about
the
matter
of
disrobing
for
the
night
when
the
shorter
man
who
had
been
in
the
apartment
when
the
other
entered
and
who
was
dark
and
had
attired
himself
in
pyjamas
he
sat
down
on
one
of
the
twin
beds
to
enjoy
his
cigar
to
the
bitter
end
has
sanang
gone
out
he
inquired
in
a
low
voice
yes
benton
went
after
him
the
other
man
nodded
cleves
he
said
i
guess
it
looks
as
though
this
norne
girl
is
in
it
too
what
happened
as
soon
as
she
arrived
sanang
made
straight
for
her
apartment
he
remained
inside
for
half
an
hour
then
he
came
out
in
a
hurry
and
went
to
his
own
rooms
where
that
surly
servant
of
his
squats
all
day
shining
up
his
arsenal
and
drinking
koumiss
did
you
get
their
conversation
i
got
a
record
of
the
gibberish
it
requires
an
interpreter
of
course
i
suppose
so
i
take
the
records
east
with
me
and
by
the
same
token
i
better
notify
new
york
that
i
leaving
he
went
to
the
telephone
got
the
telegraph
office
and
sent
the
following
message
recklow
leaving
for
with
samples
retain
expert
in
oriental
fabrics
victor
cleves
report
for
me
too
said
the
dark
young
man
who
was
still
enjoying
his
cigar
on
his
pillows
so
cleves
sent
another
telegram
directed
also
to
recklow
benton
and
i
are
watching
the
market
chinese
importations
fluctuate
recent
consignment

carefully
inspected
and
details
forwarded
alek
selden
in
the
next
room
gutchlug
could
hear
the
voice
of
cleves
at
the
telephone
but
he
merely
shrugged
his
heavy
shoulders
in
contempt
for
he
had
other
things
to
do
beside
eavesdropping
also
for
the
last
hour
in
fact
ever
since
departure
something
had
been
happening
to
him
something
that
happens
to
a
hassani
only
once
in
a
lifetime
and
now
this
unique
thing
had
happened
to
him
to
him
gutchlug
khan
to
him
before
whose
khiounnou
ancestors
thousand
nations
had
bowed
the
knee
it
had
come
to
him
at
last
this
dread
thing
unheralded
totally
unexpected
a
few
minutes
after
sanang
had
departed
and
he
suddenly
knew
he
was
going
to
die
and
when
presently
he
comprehended
it
he
bent
his
grizzled
head
and
listened
seriously
and
after
a
little
silence
he
heard
his
soul
bidding
him
farewell
so
the
chatter
of
white
men
at
a
telephone
in
the
next
apartment
had
no
longer
any
significance
for
him
whether
or
not
they
had
been
spying
on
him
whether
they
were
plotting
made
no
difference
to
him
now
he
tested
his
knife
edge
with
his
thumb
and
listened
gravely
to
his
soul
bidding
him
farewell
but
for
a
yezidee
there
was
still
a
little
detail
to
attend
to
before
his
soul
departed
two
matters
to
regulate
one
was
to
select
his
shroud
the
other
was
to
cut
the
white
throat
of
this
young
called
keuke
mongol
the
yezidee
temple
girl
and
he
could
steal
down
to
her
bedroom
and
finish
that
matter
in
five
minutes
but
first
he
must
choose
his
shroud
as
is
the
custom
of
the
yezidee
that
office
however
was
quickly
accomplished
in
a
country
where
fine
white
sheets
of
linen
are
to
be
found
on
every
hotel
bed
so
on
his
way
to
the
door
his
naked
knife
in
his
right
hand
he
paused
to
fumble
under
the
and
draw
out
a
white
linen
sheet
something
hurt
his
hand
like
a
needle
he
moved
it
felt
the
thing
squirm
under
his
fingers
and
pierce
his
palm
again
and
again
with
a
shriek
he
tore
the
bedclothes
from
the
bed
a
little
yellow
snake
lay
coiled
there
he
got
as
far
as
the
telephone
but
could
not
use
it
and
there
he
fell
heavily
shaking
the
room
and
dragging
the
instrument
down
with
him
there
was
some
excitement
cleves
and
selden
in
their
bathrobes
went
in
to
look
at
the
body
the
hotel
physician
diagnosed
it
as
or
possibly
poison
some
gazed
significantly
at
the
naked
knife
still
clutched
in
the
dead
man
hands
around
the
wrist
of
the
other
hand
was
twisted
a
pliable
gold
bracelet
representing
a
little
snake
it
had
real
emeralds
for
eyes
it
had
not
been
there
when
gutchlug
died
but
nobody
except
sanang
could
know
that
and
later
when
sanang
came
back
and
found
gutchlug
very
dead
on
the
bed
and
a
policeman
sitting
outside
he
offered
no
information
concerning
the
new
bracelet
shaped
like
a
snake
with
real
emeralds
for
eyes
which
adorned
the
dead
left
wrist
toward
evening
however
after
an
autopsy
had
confirmed
the
house
physician
diagnosis
that
had
finished
gutchlug
sanang
mustered
enough
courage
to
go
to
the
desk
in
the
lobby
and
send
up
his
card
to
miss
norne
it
appeared
however
that
miss
norne
had
left
for
chicago
about
noon
chapter
iii
grey
magic
to
victor
cleves
came
the
following
telegram
in
code
ordered
by
the
state
department
as
the
result
of
frequent
mention
in
despatches
of
chinese
troops
operating
with
the
russian
bolsheviki
forces
has
disclosed
that
the
bolsheviki
are
actually
raising
a
chinese
division
of
men
recruited
in
central
asia
this
division
has
been
guilty
of
the
greatest
cruelties
a
strange
rumour
prevails
among
the
allied
forces
at
archangel
that
this
chinese
division
is
led
by
yezidee
and
hassani
officers
belonging
to
the
sect
of
and
that
they
employ
black
arts
and
magic
in
information
so
far
gathered
by
the
several
branches
of
the
united
states
secret
service
operating
throughout
the
world
it
appears
possible
that
the
various
revolutionary
forces
of
disorder
in
europe
and
asia
which
now
are
violently
threatening
the
peace
and
security
of
all
established
civilisation
on
earth
may
have
had
a
common
origin
this
origin
it
is
now
suspected
may
date
back
to
a
very
remote
epoch
the
forces
of
violence
and
merciless
destruction
may
have
had
their
beginning
among
some
ancient
and
predatory
race
whose
existence
was
maintained
solely
by
robbery
and
terrorists
bolshevists
reds
of
all
shades
and
degrees
are
now
believed
to
represent
in
modern
times
what
perhaps
once
was
a
tribe
of
assassins
a
sect
whose
religion
was
founded
upon
a
common
predilection
for
crimes
of
this
theory
then
for
the
present
the
united
states
government
will
proceed
with
this
investigation
of
bolshevism
and
the
secret
service
will
continue
to
pay
particular
attention
to
all
orientals
in
the
united
states
and
other
countries
you
personally
are
formally
instructed
to
keep
in
touch
with
alek
selden
and
james
benton
and
to
employ
every
possible
means
to
become
friendly
with
the
girl
tressa
norne
win
her
confidence
and
if
possible
enlist
her
actively
in
the
government
service
as
your
particular
aid
and
is
equally
important
that
the
movements
of
the
oriental
called
sanang
be
carefully
observed
in
order
to
discover
the
identity
and
whereabouts
of
his
companions
however
until
further
instructions
he
is
not
to
be
taken
into
custody
signed
john
recklow
the
long
despatch
from
john
recklow
made
cleves
duty
plain
enough
for
months
now
selden
and
benton
had
been
watching
tressa
norne
and
they
had
learned
practically
nothing
about
her
and
now
the
girl
had
come
within
cleves
sphere
of
operation
she
had
been
in
new
york
for
two
weeks
telegrams
from
benton
in
chicago
and
from
selden
in
buffalo
had
prepared
him
for
her
arrival
he
had
his
men
watching
her
on
west
street
men
to
follow
her
men
to
keep
their
eyes
on
her
at
the
theatre
where
every
evening
at
her
was
staged
he
knew
where
to
get
her
but
he
himself
had
been
on
the
watch
for
the
man
sanang
and
had
failed
to
find
the
slightest
trace
of
him
in
new
york
although
warned
that
he
had
arrived
so
for
that
evening
he
left
the
hunt
for
sanang
to
others
put
on
his
evening
clothes
and
dined
with
fashionable
friends
at
the
club
who
never
for
an
instant
suspected
that
young
victor
cleves
was
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
government
about
nine
he
strolled
around
to
the
theatre
desiring
to
miss
as
much
as
possible
of
the
popular
show
without
being
too
late
to
see
the
curious
little
in
which
this
girl
tressa
norne
appeared
alone
he
had
secured
an
aisle
seat
near
the
stage
at
an
outrageous
price
the
main
show
was
still
thundering
and
fizzing
and
glittering
as
he
entered
the
theatre
so
he
stood
in
the
rear
behind
the
orchestra
until
the
descending
curtain
extinguished
the
outrageous
glare
and
din
then
he
went
down
the
aisle
and
as
he
seated
himself
tressa
norne
stepped
from
the
wings
and
stood
before
the
lowered
curtain
facing
an
expectant
but
oddly
undemonstrative
audience
the
girl
worked
rapidly
seriously
and
in
silence
she
seemed
a
mere
child
there
behind
the
footlights
not
more
than
sixteen
anyway
her
winsome
eyes
and
wistful
lips
unspoiled
by
the
world
wisdom
yet
once
or
twice
the
mouth
drooped
for
a
second
and
the
winning
eyes
darkened
to
a
remoter
blue
the
brooding
iris
hue
of
far
horizons
she
wore
the
characteristic
tabard
of
stiff
golden
tissue
and
the
gold
headpiece
of
a
yezidee
temple
girl
her
flat
was
of
stiff
gold
too
and
curled
upward
at
the
toes
all
this
accentuated
her
apparent
youth
for
in
face
and
throat
no
firmer
contours
had
as
yet
modified
the
soft
fullness
of
immaturity
her
limbs
were
boyish
and
frail
and
her
bosom
more
undecided
still
so
that
the
embroidered
breadth
of
gold
fell
flat
and
straight
from
her
chest
to
a
few
inches
above
the
ankles
she
seemed
to
have
no
stock
of
paraphernalia
with
which
to
aid
the
performance
no
assistant
no
orchestral
diversion
nor
did
she
serve
herself
with
any
magician
patter
she
did
her
work
close
to
the
footlights
behind
her
loomed
a
black
curtain
the
strip
of
stage
in
front
was
bare
even
of
carpet
the
orchestra
remained
mute
but
when
she
needed
anything
a
little
table
for
example
well
it
was
suddenly
there
where
she
required
it
a
tripod
for
instance
evidently
fitted
to
hold
the
big
iridescent
bubble
of
glass
in
which
swarmed
little
tropical
fishes
and
which
arrived
neatly
from
nowhere
she
merely
placed
her
hands
before
her
as
though
ready
to
support
something
weighty
which
she
expected
and
suddenly
the
huge
crystal
bubble
was
visible
resting
between
her
hands
and
when
she
tired
of
holding
it
she
set
it
upon
the
empty
air
and
let
go
of
it
and
instead
of
crashing
to
the
stage
with
its
finny
rainbow
swarm
of
swimmers
out
of
thin
air
appeared
a
tripod
to
support
it
applause
followed
not
very
enthusiastic
for
the
sort
of
audience
which
sustains
the
shows
of
which
her
performance
was
merely
an
is
an
audience
responsive
only
to
the
obvious
nobody
ever
before
had
seen
that
sort
of
magic
in
america
people
scarcely
knew
whether
or
not
they
quite
liked
it
the
lightning
of
innovation
stupefies
the
dull
ignorance
is
always
suspicious
of
innovation
always
afraid
to
put
itself
on
record
until
its
mind
is
made
up
by
somebody
else
so
in
this
typical
new
york
audience
approbation
was
cautious
but
every
fascinated
eye
remained
focused
on
this
young
girl
who
continued
to
do
incredible
things
which
seemed
to
resemble
putting
something
over
on
them
a
thing
which
no
uneducated
american
conglomeration
ever
quite
forgives
the
girl
silence
too
perplexed
them
they
were
accustomed
to
gabble
to
noise
to
jazz
vocal
and
instrumental
to
that
incessant
metropolitan
clamour
which
fills
every
second
with
sound
in
a
city
whose
only
distinction
is
its
din
stage
press
art
letters
social
existence
unless
noisy
mean
nothing
in
gotham
reticence
leisure
repose
are
the
three
lost
arts
the
megaphone
is
the
city
symbol
its
chiefest
crime
silence
the
girl
having
finished
with
the
big
glass
bubble
full
of
tiny
fish
picked
it
up
and
tossed
it
aside
for
a
moment
it
apparently
floated
there
in
space
like
a
changing
rainbow
tints
waxed
and
waned
on
the
surface
growing
deeper
and
more
gorgeous
until
the
floating
globe
glowed
scarlet
then
suddenly
burst
into
flame
and
vanished
and
only
a
strange
sweet
perfume
lingered
in
the
air
but
she
gave
her
perplexed
audience
no
time
to
wonder
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
stage
and
was
already
swiftly
busy
unfolding
a
white
veil
with
which
she
presently
covered
herself
draping
it
over
her
like
a
tent
the
veil
seemed
to
be
translucent
she
was
apparently
visible
seated
beneath
it
but
the
veil
turned
into
smoke
rising
into
the
air
in
a
thin
white
cloud
and
there
where
she
had
been
seated
was
a
statue
of
white
stone
the
image
of
herself
in
all
the
frail
springtide
of
early
adolescence
a
white
statue
cold
opaque
exquisite
in
its
sculptured
immobility
there
came
the
next
moment
a
sound
of
distant
thunder
flashes
lighted
the
blank
curtain
and
suddenly
a
vein
of
lightning
and
a
sharper
peal
shattered
the
statue
to
fragments
there
they
lay
broken
bits
of
her
own
sculptured
body
glistening
in
a
heap
behind
the
footlights
then
each
fragment
began
to
shimmer
with
a
rosy
internal
light
of
its
own
until
the
pile
of
broken
marble
glowed
like
living
coals
under
thickening
and
reddening
vapours
and
presently
dimly
perceptible
there
she
was
in
the
flesh
again
seated
in
the
fiery
centre
of
the
conflagration
stretching
her
arms
luxuriously
yawning
seemingly
awakening
from
refreshing
slumber
her
eyes
unclosing
to
rest
with
a
sort
of
confused
apology
upon
her
astounded
audience
as
she
rose
to
her
feet
nothing
except
herself
remained
on
the
stage
no
débris
not
a
shred
of
smoke
not
a
spark
she
came
down
then
across
an
inclined
plank
into
the
orchestra
among
the
audience
in
the
aisle
seat
nearest
her
sat
victor
cleves
his
business
was
to
be
there
that
evening
but
she
did
know
that
knew
nothing
about
him
had
never
before
set
eyes
on
him
at
her
gesture
of
invitation
he
made
a
cup
of
both
his
hands
into
these
she
poured
a
double
handful
of
unset
diamonds
or
what
appeared
to
be
diamonds
pressed
her
own
hands
above
his
for
a
second
and
the
diamonds
in
his
palms
had
become
pearls
these
were
passed
around
to
people
in
the
vicinity
and
finally
returned
to
cleves
who
at
her
request
covered
the
heap
of
pearls
with
both
his
hands
hiding
them
entirely
from
view
at
her
nod
he
uncovered
them
the
pearls
had
become
emeralds
again
while
he
held
them
and
without
even
touching
him
she
changed
them
into
rubies
then
she
turned
away
from
him
apparently
forgetting
that
he
still
held
the
gems
and
he
sat
very
still
one
cupped
hand
over
the
other
while
she
poured
silver
coins
into
a
woman
gloved
hands
turned
them
into
gold
coins
then
flung
each
coin
into
the
air
where
it
changed
to
a
living
fragrant
rose
and
fell
among
the
audience
presently
she
seemed
to
remember
cleve
came
back
down
the
aisle
and
under
his
close
and
intent
gaze
drew
from
his
cupped
hands
one
by
one
a
score
of
brilliant
little
living
birds
which
continually
flew
about
her
and
finally
perched
twittering
on
her
golden
headdress
a
of
living
jewels
as
she
drew
the
last
warm
breathing
little
feathered
miracle
from
cleves
hands
and
released
it
he
said
rapidly
under
his
breath
i
want
a
word
with
you
later
where
she
let
her
clear
eyes
rest
on
him
for
a
moment
then
with
a
shrug
so
slight
that
it
was
perceptible
perhaps
only
to
him
she
moved
on
along
the
inclined
way
stepped
daintily
over
the
footlights
caught
fire
apparently
nodded
to
a
badly
rattled
audience
and
sauntered
off
burning
from
head
to
foot
what
applause
there
was
became
merged
in
a
dissonant
instrumental
outburst
from
the
orchestra
the
great
god
jazz
resumed
direction
the
mindless
audience
breathed
freely
again
as
the
curtain
rose
upon
a
familiar
yelling
turbulence
including
all
that
gotham
really
understands
and
cares
for
legs
and
noise
victor
cleves
glanced
up
at
the
stage
then
continued
to
study
the
name
of
the
girl
on
the
programme
it
was
featured
in
rather
pathetic
solitude
under
and
he
read
further
during
the
miss
tressa
norne
will
entertain
you
with
several
phases
of
black
magic
this
strange
knowledge
was
acquired
by
miss
norne
from
the
yezidees
among
which
almost
unknown
people
still
remain
descendants
of
that
notorious
and
formidable
historic
personage
known
in
the
twelfth
century
as
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
or
the
old
man
of
mount
alamout
the
pleasant
profession
of
this
historic
individual
was
assassination
and
some
historians
now
believe
that
genuine
occult
power
played
a
part
in
his
dreadful
record
a
record
which
terminated
only
when
the
infantry
of
genghis
khan
took
mount
alamout
by
storm
and
hanged
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
and
burned
his
body
under
a
boulder
of
for
miss
norne
performance
there
appears
to
be
no
plausible
practical
or
scientific
explanation
during
her
performance
the
curtain
will
remain
lowered
for
fifteen
minutes
and
will
then
rise
on
the
last
act
of
betcha
life
the
noisy
show
continued
while
cleves
paying
it
scant
attention
brooded
over
the
programme
and
ever
his
keen
grey
eyes
reverted
to
her
name
tressa
norne
then
for
a
little
while
he
settled
back
and
let
his
absent
gaze
wander
over
the
galloping
battalions
of
painted
girls
and
the
slapstick
principals
whose
perpetual
motion
evoked
screams
of
approbation
from
the
audience
amid
the
din
of
the
great
god
jazz
he
had
an
aisle
seat
he
disturbed
nobody
when
he
went
out
and
around
to
the
stage
door
the
aged
man
on
duty
took
his
card
called
a
boy
and
sent
it
off
the
boy
returned
with
the
card
saying
that
miss
norne
had
already
dressed
and
departed
cleves
tipped
him
and
then
tipped
the
doorman
heavily
where
does
she
live
he
asked
say
said
the
old
man
i
dunno
and
that
straight
but
them
ladies
mostly
goes
up
to
the
roof
for
a
look
in
at
the
masque
and
a
dance
afterward
was
you
ever
up
there
yes
seen
the
new
show
no
well
up
while
you
can
get
a
table
and
i
bet
the
little
girl
will
be
somewheres
around
the
little
girl
somewheres
around
he
secured
a
table
turned
and
looked
about
at
the
vast
cabaret
into
which
only
a
few
people
had
yet
filtered
and
saw
her
at
a
distance
in
the
carpeted
corridor
buying
violets
from
one
of
the
a
waiter
placed
a
reserve
card
on
his
table
he
continued
on
around
the
outer
edge
of
the
auditorium
miss
norne
had
already
seated
herself
at
a
small
table
in
the
rear
and
a
waiter
was
serving
her
with
iced
orange
juice
and
little
french
cakes
when
the
waiter
returned
cleves
went
up
and
took
off
his
hat
may
i
talk
with
you
for
a
moment
miss
norne
he
said
the
girl
looked
up
the
still
between
her
scarlet
lips
then
apparently
recognising
in
him
the
young
man
in
the
audience
who
had
spoken
to
her
she
resumed
her
business
of
imbibing
orange
juice
the
girl
seemed
even
frailer
and
younger
in
her
hat
and
street
gown
a
stole
hung
from
her
shoulders
a
gold
bag
lay
on
the
table
under
the
bunch
of
violets
she
paid
no
attention
whatever
to
him
presently
her
buckled
and
she
selected
a
better
one
he
said
there
something
rather
serious
i
like
to
speak
to
you
about
if
you
let
me
i
not
the
sort
you
evidently
suppose
i
not
trying
to
annoy
you
at
that
she
looked
around
and
upward
once
more
very
very
young
but
already
spoiled
he
thought
for
the
eyes
were
coolly
appraising
him
and
the
droop
of
the
mouth
had
become
almost
sullen
besides
traces
of
paint
still
remained
to
incarnadine
lip
and
cheek
and
there
was
a
hint
of
hardness
in
the
youthful
plumpness
of
the
features
are
you
a
professional
she
asked
without
curiosity
a
theatrical
man
no
then
if
you
have
anything
to
offer
me
what
is
it
you
wish
i
have
a
job
to
offer
if
you
care
for
it
and
if
you
are
up
to
it
he
said
her
eyes
became
slightly
hostile
what
kind
of
job
do
you
mean
i
want
to
learn
something
about
you
first
will
you
come
over
to
my
table
and
talk
it
over
no
what
sort
do
you
suppose
me
to
be
he
inquired
amused
the
usual
sort
i
suppose
you
mean
a
johnny
yes
of
sorts
she
let
her
insolent
eyes
sweep
him
once
more
from
head
to
foot
he
was
a
young
man
and
in
his
evening
dress
he
had
that
something
about
him
which
placed
him
very
definitely
where
he
really
belonged
would
you
mind
looking
at
my
card
he
asked
he
drew
it
out
and
laid
it
beside
her
and
without
stirring
she
scanned
it
sideways
that
my
name
and
address
he
continued
i
not
contemplating
mischief
i
enough
excitement
in
life
without
seeking
adventure
besides
i
not
the
sort
who
goes
about
annoying
women
she
glanced
up
at
him
again
you
are
annoying
me
i
sorry
i
was
quite
honest
he
took
his
with
unhurried
amiability
had
already
turned
away
when
she
said
please
what
do
you
desire
to
say
to
me
he
came
back
to
her
table
i
could
tell
you
until
i
know
a
little
more
about
you
what
do
you
wish
to
know
several
things
i
could
scarcely
ask
you
go
over
such
matters
with
you
standing
here
there
was
a
pause
the
girl
juggled
with
the
straw
on
the
table
for
a
few
moments
then
partly
turning
she
summoned
a
waiter
paid
him
adjusted
her
stole
picked
up
her
gold
bag
and
her
violets
and
stood
up
then
she
turned
to
cleves
and
gave
him
a
direct
look
which
had
in
it
the
impersonal
and
searching
gaze
of
a
child
when
they
were
seated
at
the
table
reserved
for
him
the
place
already
was
filling
rapidly
backwash
from
the
theatres
slopped
through
every
aisle
people
not
yet
surfeited
with
noise
not
yet
sufficiently
sodden
by
their
worship
of
the
great
god
jazz
jazz
said
cleves
glancing
across
his
at
tressa
norne
what
the
meaning
of
the
word
do
you
happen
to
know
does
it
come
from
the
french
he
smiled
possibly
i
rather
hungry
are
you
yes
will
you
indicate
your
preferences
she
studied
her
card
and
presently
he
gave
the
order
i
like
some
champagne
she
said
unless
you
think
it
too
expensive
he
smiled
at
that
too
and
gave
the
order
i
did
suggest
any
wine
because
you
seem
so
young
he
said
how
old
do
i
seem
sixteen
perhaps
i
am
then
you
had
no
troubles
i
do
know
what
you
call
trouble
she
remarked
indifferently
watching
the
arriving
throngs
the
orchestra
too
had
taken
its
place
well
she
said
now
that
you
picked
me
up
what
do
you
really
want
of
me
there
was
no
mitigating
smile
to
soften
what
she
said
she
dropped
her
elbows
on
the
table
rested
her
chin
between
her
palms
and
looked
at
him
with
the
same
searching
undisturbed
expression
that
is
so
disconcerting
in
children
as
he
made
no
reply
may
i
have
a
cocktail
she
inquired
he
gave
the
order
and
his
mind
registered
pessimism
there
is
nothing
doing
with
this
girl
he
thought
she
already
on
the
toboggan
but
he
said
aloud
that
was
beautiful
work
you
did
down
in
the
theatre
miss
norne
did
you
think
so
of
course
it
was
astounding
work
thank
you
but
managers
and
audiences
differ
with
you
then
they
are
very
stupid
he
said
possibly
but
that
does
not
help
me
pay
my
board
do
you
mean
you
have
trouble
in
securing
theatrical
engagements
yes
i
am
through
here
and
there
nothing
else
in
view
so
far
that
incredible
he
exclaimed
she
lifted
her
glass
slowly
drained
it
for
a
few
moments
she
caressed
the
stem
of
the
empty
glass
her
gaze
remote
yes
it
that
way
she
said
from
the
beginning
i
felt
that
my
audiences
were
not
in
sympathy
with
me
sometimes
it
even
amounts
to
hostility
americans
do
not
like
what
i
do
even
if
it
holds
their
attention
i
do
quite
understand
why
they
do
like
it
but
always
conscious
they
do
and
of
course
that
settles
it
has
settled
the
whole
thing
once
and
for
all
what
are
you
going
to
do
what
others
do
i
presume
what
do
others
do
he
inquired
watching
the
lovely
sullen
eyes
oh
they
do
what
i
doing
now
do
they
let
some
man
pick
them
up
and
feed
them
she
lifted
her
indifferent
eyes
i
not
criticising
you
i
meant
to
do
it
some
day
when
i
had
courage
that
why
i
just
asked
you
if
i
might
have
some
champagne
finding
myself
a
little
scared
at
my
first
step
but
you
say
you
might
have
a
job
for
me
did
you
suppose
i
have
what
are
you
going
to
do
the
curtain
was
rising
she
nodded
toward
the
bespangled
chorus
probably
that
sort
of
thing
they
asked
me
supper
was
served
they
both
were
hungry
and
thirsty
the
music
made
conversation
difficult
so
they
supped
in
silence
and
watched
the
imbecile
show
conceived
by
vulgarians
produced
by
vulgarians
and
served
up
to
mental
degenerates
of
the
same
species
the
average
metropolitan
audience
for
ten
minutes
a
pair
of
comedians
fell
up
and
down
a
flight
of
steps
and
the
audience
shrieked
approval
miss
norne
the
girl
who
had
been
watching
the
show
turned
in
her
chair
and
looked
back
at
him
your
magic
is
by
far
the
most
wonderful
i
have
ever
seen
or
heard
of
even
in
india
such
things
are
not
done
no
not
in
india
she
said
indifferently
where
then
in
china
you
learned
to
do
such
things
there
yes
where
in
china
did
you
learn
such
amazing
magic
in
yian
i
never
heard
of
it
is
it
a
province
a
city
and
you
lived
there
fourteen
years
when
from
to
during
the
great
war
he
remarked
you
were
in
china
yes
then
you
arrived
here
very
recently
in
november
from
the
coast
i
see
you
played
the
theatres
from
the
coast
eastward
and
went
to
pieces
in
new
york
she
added
calmly
finishing
her
glass
of
champagne
have
you
any
family
he
asked
no
do
you
care
to
say
anything
further
he
inquired
pleasantly
about
my
family
yes
if
you
wish
my
father
was
in
the
spice
trade
in
yian
the
yezidees
took
yian
in
threw
him
into
a
well
in
his
own
compound
and
filled
it
up
with
dead
imperial
troops
i
was
thirteen
years
old
the
hassani
did
that
they
held
yian
nearly
eight
years
and
i
lived
with
my
mother
in
a
garden
pagoda
until
in
january
of
that
year
germans
got
through
from
they
had
been
six
months
on
the
way
i
think
they
were
hassanis
anyway
they
persuaded
the
hassanis
to
massacre
every
prisoner
and
so
my
mother
died
in
the
garden
pagoda
of
yian
i
was
not
told
for
four
years
why
did
they
spare
you
he
asked
astonished
at
her
story
so
quietly
told
so
utterly
destitute
of
emotion
i
was
seventeen
a
certain
person
had
placed
me
among
the
temple
girls
in
the
temple
of
erlik
it
pleased
this
person
to
make
of
me
a
mongol
temple
girl
as
a
mockery
at
christ
they
gave
me
the
name
keuke
mongol
i
asked
to
serve
the
shrine
of
she
being
like
to
our
madonna
but
this
person
gave
me
the
choice
between
the
halberds
of
the
tchortchas
and
the
sorcery
of
erlik
she
lifted
her
sombre
eyes
so
i
learned
how
to
do
the
things
you
saw
but
what
i
did
there
on
the
stage
is
not
respectable
an
odd
shiver
passed
over
him
for
a
second
he
took
her
literally
suddenly
convinced
that
her
magic
was
not
white
but
black
as
the
demon
at
whose
shrine
she
had
learned
it
then
he
smiled
and
asked
her
pleasantly
whether
indeed
she
employed
hypnosis
in
her
miraculous
exhibitions
but
her
eyes
became
more
sombre
still
and
i
do
care
to
talk
about
it
she
said
i
have
already
said
too
much
i
sorry
i
did
mean
to
pry
into
professional
secrets
i
ca
talk
about
it
she
repeated
please
my
glass
is
quite
empty
when
he
had
refilled
it
how
did
you
get
away
from
yian
he
asked
the
japanese
what
luck
yes
one
battle
was
fought
at
buldak
the
hassanis
and
blue
flags
were
terribly
cut
up
then
outside
the
walls
of
yian
prince
tchortcha
infantry
made
a
stand
he
was
there
with
his
yezidee
horsemen
all
in
leather
and
silk
armour
with
casques
and
corselets
of
black
indian
steel
i
could
see
them
from
the
temple
saw
the
japanese
gunners
open
fire
the
tchortchas
were
blown
to
shreds
in
the
blast
of
the
japanese
guns
sanang
got
away
with
some
of
his
yezidee
horsemen
where
was
that
battle
i
told
you
outside
the
walls
of
yian
the
newspapers
never
mentioned
any
such
trouble
in
china
he
said
suspiciously
nobody
knows
about
it
except
the
germans
and
the
japanese
who
is
this
sanang
he
demanded
a
he
is
one
of
the
a
servant
of
the
old
man
of
mount
alamout
what
is
a
sorcerer
assassin
what
exclaimed
cleves
incredulously
why
yes
she
said
calmly
have
you
never
heard
of
the
old
man
of
mount
alamout
well
yes
the
succession
has
been
unbroken
since
hassan
sabbah
is
still
the
present
old
man
of
the
mountain
his
yezidees
worship
erlik
they
are
sorcerers
but
you
would
not
believe
that
cleves
said
with
a
smile
who
is
erlik
the
mongols
satan
oh
so
these
yezidees
are
they
are
more
they
actually
devils
you
do
really
believe
that
even
in
unexplored
china
there
exists
such
a
creature
as
a
real
sorcerer
do
you
he
inquired
smilingly
i
do
wish
to
talk
of
it
to
his
surprise
her
face
had
flushed
and
he
thought
her
sensitive
mouth
quivered
a
little
he
watched
her
in
silence
for
a
moment
then
leaning
a
little
way
across
the
table
where
are
you
going
when
the
show
here
closes
to
my
and
then
to
bed
she
said
sullenly
and
what
do
you
mean
to
do
go
out
to
the
agencies
and
ask
for
work
and
if
there
is
none
the
chorus
she
said
indifferently
what
salary
have
you
been
getting
she
told
him
will
you
take
three
times
that
amount
and
work
with
me
chapter
iv
body
and
soul
the
girl
direct
gaze
met
his
with
that
merciless
searching
intentness
he
already
knew
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
enter
the
service
of
the
united
states
work
for
the
government
she
was
too
taken
aback
to
answer
where
were
you
born
he
demanded
abruptly
in
albany
new
york
she
replied
in
a
dazed
way
you
are
loyal
to
your
country
yes
certainly
you
would
not
betray
her
no
i
do
mean
for
money
i
mean
from
fear
after
a
moment
and
avoiding
his
gaze
i
am
afraid
of
death
she
said
very
simply
he
waited
i
i
do
know
what
i
might
do
being
afraid
she
added
in
a
troubled
voice
i
desire
to
live
he
still
waited
she
lifted
her
eyes
i
try
not
to
betray
my
country
she
murmured
try
to
face
death
for
your
country
honour
yes
and
for
your
own
yes
and
for
my
own
he
leaned
nearer
yet
you
taking
a
chance
on
your
own
honour
she
blushed
brightly
i
did
think
i
was
taking
a
very
great
chance
with
you
he
said
you
have
found
life
too
hard
and
when
you
faced
failure
in
new
york
you
began
to
let
go
of
life
real
life
i
mean
and
you
came
up
here
wondering
whether
you
had
courage
to
let
yourself
go
when
i
spoke
to
you
it
scared
you
you
found
you
had
the
courage
but
perhaps
you
might
find
it
or
next
week
if
sufficiently
scared
by
hunger
you
might
venture
to
take
the
first
step
along
the
path
that
you
say
others
usually
take
sooner
or
later
the
girl
flushed
scarlet
sat
looking
at
him
out
of
eyes
grown
dark
with
anger
he
said
you
told
me
an
untruth
you
been
tempted
to
betray
your
country
you
have
resisted
you
been
threatened
with
death
you
had
courage
to
defy
threats
and
temptations
where
your
honour
was
concerned
how
do
you
know
she
demanded
he
continued
ignoring
the
question
from
the
time
you
landed
in
san
francisco
you
have
been
threatened
you
tried
to
earn
a
living
by
your
magician
tricks
but
in
city
after
city
as
you
came
east
your
uneasiness
grew
into
fear
and
your
fear
into
terror
because
every
day
more
terribly
confirmed
your
belief
that
people
were
following
you
determined
either
to
use
you
to
their
own
purposes
or
to
murder
you
the
girl
turned
quite
white
and
half
rose
in
her
chair
then
sank
back
staring
at
him
out
of
dilated
eyes
then
cleves
smiled
so
you
got
the
nerve
to
do
government
work
he
said
and
you
got
the
intelligence
and
the
knowledge
and
something
else
i
do
know
exactly
what
to
call
it
skill
dexterity
sorcery
he
smiled
i
mean
your
professional
ability
that
what
i
want
that
bewildering
dexterity
of
yours
to
help
your
own
country
in
the
fight
of
its
life
will
you
enlist
for
service
fight
she
asked
faintly
the
fight
with
the
red
spectre
anarchy
yes
are
you
ready
to
leave
this
place
i
want
to
talk
to
you
where
in
my
own
rooms
after
a
moment
she
rose
i
go
to
your
rooms
with
you
she
said
she
added
very
calmly
that
she
was
glad
it
was
to
be
his
rooms
and
not
some
other
man
out
of
countenance
he
demanded
what
she
meant
and
she
said
quite
candidly
that
she
made
up
her
mind
to
live
at
any
cost
and
that
if
she
could
make
an
honest
living
she
make
a
living
anyway
he
offered
no
reply
to
this
until
they
had
reached
the
street
and
he
had
called
a
taxi
on
their
way
to
his
apartment
he
the
subject
rather
bluntly
remarking
that
life
was
not
worth
living
at
the
price
she
had
mentioned
that
is
the
accepted
christian
theory
she
replied
coolly
but
circumstances
alter
things
not
such
things
oh
yes
they
do
if
one
is
already
damned
what
difference
does
anything
else
make
he
asked
sarcastically
whether
she
considered
herself
already
damned
she
did
not
reply
for
a
few
moments
then
she
said
in
a
quick
breathless
way
that
souls
have
been
entrapped
through
ignorance
of
evil
and
asked
him
if
he
did
not
believe
it
no
he
said
i
do
she
shook
her
head
you
could
understand
she
said
but
i
made
up
my
mind
to
one
thing
even
if
my
soul
has
perished
my
body
shall
not
die
for
a
long
long
time
i
mean
to
live
she
added
i
shall
not
let
my
body
be
slain
they
shall
not
steal
life
from
me
whatever
they
have
done
to
my
soul
what
in
heaven
name
are
you
talking
about
he
exclaimed
do
you
actually
believe
in
and
she
seemed
sullen
her
profile
turned
to
him
her
eyes
on
the
brilliantly
lighted
avenue
up
which
they
were
speeding
after
a
while
i
rather
live
decently
and
respectably
if
i
can
she
said
that
is
the
natural
desire
of
any
girl
i
suppose
but
if
i
ca
nevertheless
i
shall
beat
off
death
at
any
cost
and
whatever
the
price
of
life
is
i
shall
pay
it
because
i
am
absolutely
determined
to
go
on
living
and
if
i
ca
provide
the
means
i
have
to
let
some
man
do
it
i
suppose
it
a
good
thing
it
was
i
who
found
you
when
you
were
out
of
a
job
he
remarked
coldly
i
hope
so
she
said
even
in
the
beginning
i
did
really
believe
you
meant
to
be
impertinent
a
tragic
smile
touched
her
lips
and
i
was
almost
sorry
are
you
quite
crazy
he
demanded
no
my
mind
is
untouched
it
my
soul
that
gone
do
you
know
i
was
very
hungry
when
you
spoke
to
me
the
management
would
advance
anything
and
my
last
money
went
for
my
room
last
monday
i
had
three
dollars
to
face
the
future
and
no
job
i
spent
the
last
of
it
on
violets
orange
juice
and
cakes
my
furs
and
my
gold
bag
remain
i
can
go
two
months
more
on
them
then
it
a
job
or
she
shrugged
and
buried
her
nose
in
her
violets
suppose
i
advance
you
a
month
salary
he
said
what
am
i
to
do
for
it
the
taxi
stopped
at
a
florist
on
the
corner
of
madison
avenue
and
street
overhead
were
apartments
there
was
no
elevator
merely
the
street
door
to
unlock
and
four
dim
flights
of
stairs
rising
steeply
to
the
top
he
lived
on
the
top
floor
as
they
paused
before
his
door
in
the
dim
corridor
are
you
afraid
he
asked
she
came
nearer
laid
a
hand
on
his
arm
are
afraid
he
stood
silent
the
in
his
hand
i
not
afraid
of
myself
if
that
is
what
you
mean
he
said
that
is
partly
what
i
mean
you
have
to
mount
guard
over
your
soul
i
look
out
for
my
soul
he
retorted
dryly
do
so
i
lost
mine
i
i
would
not
wish
any
harm
to
yours
through
our
companionship
do
you
worry
about
my
soul
he
remarked
fitting
the
key
to
the
lock
but
again
her
hand
fell
on
his
wrist
wait
i
ca
ca
help
warning
you
neither
your
soul
nor
your
body
are
safe
if
if
you
ever
do
make
of
me
a
companion
i
to
tell
you
this
what
are
you
talking
about
he
demanded
bluntly
because
you
have
been
courteous
considerate
and
you
know
oh
you
do
realise
what
spiritual
peril
is
what
your
soul
and
body
have
to
fear
if
you
if
you
win
me
over
if
you
ever
manage
to
make
of
me
a
friend
he
said
people
follow
and
threaten
you
we
know
that
i
understand
also
that
association
with
you
involves
me
and
that
i
shall
no
doubt
be
menaced
with
bodily
harm
he
laid
his
hand
on
hers
where
it
still
rested
on
his
sleeves
but
that
my
business
miss
norne
he
added
with
a
smile
so
otherwise
it
being
merely
a
plain
business
affair
between
you
and
me
i
think
i
may
also
venture
my
immortal
soul
alone
with
you
in
my
room
the
girl
flushed
darkly
you
have
misunderstood
she
said
he
looked
at
her
coolly
intently
and
arrived
at
no
conclusion
young
very
lovely
confessedly
without
moral
principle
he
still
could
not
believe
her
actually
depraved
what
did
you
mean
he
said
bluntly
in
companionship
with
the
lost
one
might
lose
one
way
unawares
do
you
know
that
there
is
an
evil
loose
in
the
world
which
is
bent
upon
conquest
by
control
of
men
no
he
replied
amused
and
that
through
the
capture
of
men
minds
and
souls
the
destruction
of
civilisation
is
being
planned
is
that
what
you
learned
in
your
captivity
miss
norne
you
do
not
believe
me
i
believe
your
terrible
experiences
in
china
have
shaken
you
to
your
tragic
little
soul
horror
and
grief
and
loneliness
have
left
scars
on
tender
impressionable
youth
they
would
have
slain
maturity
broken
it
crushed
it
but
youth
is
flexible
pliable
and
bends
gives
way
under
pressure
scars
become
slowly
effaced
it
shall
be
so
with
you
you
will
learn
to
understand
that
nothing
really
can
harm
the
soul
for
a
few
moments
silence
they
stood
facing
each
other
on
the
dim
landing
outside
his
locked
door
nothing
can
slay
our
souls
he
repeated
in
a
grave
voice
i
do
not
believe
you
really
ever
have
done
anything
to
wound
even
your
i
do
not
believe
you
are
capable
of
it
or
ever
have
been
or
ever
will
be
but
somebody
has
deeply
wounded
you
spiritually
and
has
wounded
your
mind
to
persuade
you
that
your
soul
is
no
longer
in
god
keeping
for
that
is
a
lie
he
saw
her
features
working
with
poignant
emotions
as
though
struggling
to
believe
him
souls
are
never
lost
he
said
ungoverned
passions
of
every
sort
merely
cripple
them
for
a
space
god
always
heals
them
in
the
end
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
once
more
and
lifted
the
do
she
whispered
catching
his
hand
again
if
there
should
be
somebody
in
there
waiting
for
us
there
is
not
a
soul
in
my
rooms
my
servant
sleeps
out
there
somebody
there
she
said
trembling
nobody
miss
norne
will
you
come
in
with
me
i
do
dare
why
you
and
i
alone
together
no
oh
please
please
i
am
afraid
of
what
of
giving
you
my
and
trust
and
and
i
want
you
to
i
must
not
it
would
destroy
us
both
soul
and
body
i
tell
you
he
said
impatiently
that
there
is
no
destruction
of
the
soul
and
it
a
clean
comradeship
anyway
a
fighting
friendship
i
ask
of
you
i
ask
all
i
offer
wherein
then
lies
this
peril
in
being
alone
together
because
i
am
finding
it
in
my
heart
to
believe
in
you
trust
you
hold
fast
to
your
strength
and
protection
and
if
i
give
way
yield
and
if
i
make
you
a
promise
and
there
is
anybody
in
that
room
to
see
us
and
hear
us
we
shall
be
destroyed
both
of
us
soul
and
body
he
took
her
hands
held
them
until
their
trembling
ceased
i
answer
for
our
bodies
let
god
look
after
the
rest
will
you
trust
him
she
nodded
and
me
yes
but
her
face
blanched
as
he
turned
the
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
preceded
her
into
the
room
beyond
the
place
was
one
of
those
accentless
typical
bachelor
apartments
made
comfortable
for
anything
masculine
but
quite
unlivable
otherwise
live
coals
still
glowed
in
the
hob
grate
he
placed
a
lump
of
cannel
coal
on
the
embers
used
a
bellows
vigorously
and
the
flame
caught
with
a
greasy
crackle
the
girl
stood
motionless
until
he
pulled
up
an
easy
chair
for
her
then
he
found
another
for
himself
she
let
slip
her
furs
folded
her
hands
around
the
bunch
of
violets
and
waited
now
he
said
i
come
to
the
point
in
i
was
at
plattsburg
expecting
a
commission
the
department
of
justice
sent
for
me
i
went
to
washington
where
i
was
made
to
understand
that
i
had
been
selected
to
serve
my
country
in
what
is
vaguely
known
as
the
secret
service
and
which
includes
government
agents
attached
to
several
departments
the
great
war
is
over
but
i
am
still
retained
in
the
service
because
something
more
sinister
than
a
hun
victory
over
civilisation
threatens
this
republic
and
threatens
the
civilised
world
anarchy
she
said
bolshevism
she
did
not
stir
in
her
chair
she
had
become
very
white
she
said
nothing
he
looked
at
her
with
his
quiet
reassuring
smile
that
what
i
want
of
you
he
repeated
i
want
your
help
he
went
on
i
want
your
valuable
knowledge
of
the
orient
i
want
whatever
secret
information
you
possess
i
want
your
rather
amazing
gifts
your
unprecedented
experience
among
almost
unknown
people
your
familiarity
with
occult
things
your
astounding
powers
whatever
they
are
hypnotic
psychic
material
because
civilisation
is
engaged
in
a
secret
battle
for
existence
against
gathering
powers
of
violence
the
force
and
limit
of
which
are
still
unguessed
it
is
a
battle
between
righteousness
and
evil
between
sanity
and
insanity
light
and
darkness
god
and
satan
and
if
civilisation
does
not
win
then
the
world
perishes
she
raised
her
still
eyes
to
his
but
made
no
other
movement
miss
norne
he
said
we
in
the
international
service
know
enough
about
you
to
desire
to
know
more
we
already
knew
the
story
you
have
told
to
me
agents
in
the
international
secret
service
kept
in
touch
with
you
from
the
time
that
the
japanese
escorted
you
out
of
china
from
the
day
you
landed
and
all
across
the
continent
to
new
york
you
have
been
kept
in
view
by
agents
of
this
government
here
in
new
york
my
men
have
kept
in
touch
with
you
and
now
the
moment
has
come
for
a
personal
understanding
between
you
and
me
the
girl
pale
lips
moved
became
stiffly
articulate
i
i
wish
to
live
she
stammered
i
fear
death
i
know
it
i
know
what
i
ask
when
i
ask
your
help
she
said
in
the
ghost
of
a
voice
if
i
turn
against
they
will
kill
me
they
try
he
said
quietly
they
will
not
fail
mr
cleves
that
is
in
god
hands
she
became
deathly
white
at
that
no
she
burst
out
in
an
agonised
voice
it
is
not
in
god
hands
if
it
were
i
should
not
be
afraid
it
is
in
the
hands
of
those
who
stole
my
soul
she
covered
her
face
with
both
arms
fairly
writhing
on
her
chair
if
the
yezidees
have
actually
made
you
believe
any
such
nonsense
he
began
but
she
dropped
her
arms
and
stared
at
him
out
of
terrible
blue
eyes
i
do
want
to
die
i
tell
you
i
am
afraid
if
i
reveal
to
you
what
i
know
they
kill
me
if
i
turn
against
them
and
aid
you
they
slay
my
body
and
send
it
after
my
soul
she
was
trembling
so
violently
that
he
sprang
up
and
went
to
her
after
a
moment
he
passed
one
arm
around
her
shoulders
and
held
her
firmly
close
to
him
come
he
said
do
your
duty
those
who
enlist
under
the
banner
of
christ
have
nothing
to
dread
in
this
world
or
the
next
if
if
i
could
believe
i
were
safe
there
i
tell
you
that
you
are
so
is
every
human
soul
what
mad
nonsense
have
the
yezidees
made
you
believe
is
there
any
surer
salvation
for
the
soul
than
to
die
in
christ
service
he
slipped
his
arm
from
her
quivering
shoulders
and
grasped
both
her
hands
crushing
them
as
though
to
steady
every
fibre
in
her
tortured
body
i
want
you
to
live
i
want
to
live
too
but
i
tell
you
it
in
hands
and
we
soldiers
of
civilisation
have
nothing
to
fear
except
failure
to
do
our
duty
now
then
are
we
comrades
under
the
united
states
government
o
god
i
dare
not
we
perhaps
she
felt
the
physical
pain
of
his
crushing
grip
for
she
turned
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
i
do
want
to
die
she
whispered
do
make
me
will
you
help
your
country
the
terrible
directness
of
her
child
gaze
became
almost
unendurable
to
him
will
you
offer
your
country
your
soul
and
body
he
insisted
in
a
low
tense
voice
her
stiff
lips
formed
a
word
yes
he
exclaimed
yes
for
a
moment
she
rested
against
his
shoulder
deathly
white
then
in
a
flash
she
had
straightened
was
on
her
feet
in
one
bound
and
so
swiftly
that
he
scarcely
followed
her
movement
was
unaware
that
she
had
risen
until
he
saw
her
standing
there
with
a
pistol
glittering
in
her
hand
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
portières
that
hung
across
the
corridor
leading
to
his
bedroom
what
on
earth
he
began
but
she
interrupted
him
keeping
her
gaze
focused
on
the
curtains
and
the
pistol
resting
level
on
her
hip
i
answer
you
if
i
die
for
it
she
cried
i
tell
you
everything
i
know
you
wish
to
learn
what
is
this
monstrous
evil
that
threatens
the
world
with
destruction
what
you
call
anarchy
and
bolshevism
it
is
an
evil
that
was
born
before
christ
came
it
is
an
evil
which
not
only
destroys
cities
and
empires
and
men
but
which
is
more
terrible
still
for
it
obtains
control
of
the
human
mind
and
uses
it
at
will
and
it
obtains
sovereignty
over
the
soul
and
makes
it
prisoner
its
aim
is
to
dominate
first
then
to
destroy
it
was
conceived
in
the
beginning
by
erlik
and
by
sorcerers
and
devils
always
from
the
first
there
have
been
sorcerers
and
living
devils
and
when
human
history
began
to
be
remembered
and
chronicled
devils
were
living
who
worshiped
erlik
and
practised
sorcery
they
have
been
called
by
many
names
a
thousand
years
before
christ
hassan
sabbah
founded
his
sect
called
hassanis
or
assassins
the
yezidees
are
of
them
their
chief
is
still
called
sabbah
their
creed
is
the
annihilation
of
civilisation
cleves
had
risen
the
girl
spoke
in
a
clear
accentless
monotone
not
looking
at
him
her
eyes
and
pistol
centred
on
the
motionless
curtains
look
out
she
cried
sharply
what
is
the
matter
he
demanded
do
you
suppose
anybody
is
hidden
behind
that
curtain
in
the
passageway
if
there
is
she
replied
in
her
excited
but
distinct
voice
here
is
a
tale
to
entertain
him
the
hassanis
are
a
sect
of
assassins
which
has
spread
out
of
asia
all
over
the
world
and
they
are
determined
upon
the
annihilation
of
everything
and
everybody
in
it
except
themselves
in
germany
is
a
branch
of
the
sect
the
hun
is
the
lineal
descendant
of
the
ancient
yezidee
the
gods
of
the
hun
are
the
old
demons
under
other
names
the
desire
and
object
of
the
hun
is
the
same
desire
to
rule
the
minds
and
bodies
and
souls
of
men
and
use
them
to
their
own
purposes
she
lifted
her
pistol
a
little
came
a
pace
forward
anarchist

hassani
boche

all
are
the
same
all
are
secretly
swarming
in
the
hidden
places
for
the
same
purpose
the
girl
blue
eyes
were
aflame
now
and
the
pistol
was
lifting
slowly
in
her
hand
to
a
deadly
level
sanang
she
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
sanang
she
cried
again
in
her
terrifying
young
voice
toad
tortoise
egg
spittle
of
erlik
may
the
thirty
thousand
calamities
overtake
you
cowardly
khan
whom
i
laughed
at
from
the
temple
when
it
rained
yellow
snakes
on
the
marble
steps
when
all
the
gongs
in
yian
sounded
in
your
frightened
ears
she
waited
what
you
wo
step
out
she
exclaimed
in
a
ringing
tone
and
made
a
swift
motion
with
her
left
hand
apparently
out
of
her
empty
open
palm
like
a
missile
hurled
a
thin
blinding
beam
of
light
struck
the
curtains
making
them
suddenly
transparent
man
stood
he
came
out
moving
very
slowly
as
though
partly
stupefied
he
wore
evening
dress
under
his
overcoat
and
had
a
long
knife
in
his
right
hand
nobody
spoke
so
i
really
was
to
die
then
if
i
came
here
said
the
girl
in
a
wondering
way
sanang
stealthy
gaze
rested
on
her
stole
toward
cleves
he
moistened
his
lips
with
his
tongue
you
deliver
me
to
this
government
agent
he
asked
hoarsely
i
deliver
nobody
by
treachery
you
may
go
sanang
he
hesitated
a
graceful
faultless
metropolitan
figure
in
and
evening
attire
then
as
he
started
to
move
cleves
covered
him
with
his
weapon
i
ca
let
that
man
go
free
cried
cleves
angrily
very
well
she
retorted
in
a
passionate
voice
then
take
him
if
you
are
able
look
out
for
yourself
something
swift
as
lightning
struck
the
pistol
from
his
grasp
blinded
him
half
stunned
him
set
him
reeling
in
a
drenching
blaze
of
light
that
blotted
out
all
else
he
heard
the
door
slam
he
stumbled
caught
at
the
back
of
a
chair
while
his
senses
and
sight
were
clearing
by
heavens
he
whispered
with
ashen
lips
you
you
a
sorceress
or
something
what
what
are
you
doing
to
me
there
was
no
answer
and
when
his
vision
cleared
a
little
more
he
saw
her
crouched
on
the
floor
her
head
against
the
locked
door
listening
perhaps
or
sobbing
he
scarcely
understood
which
until
the
quiver
of
her
shoulders
made
it
plainer
when
at
last
cleves
went
to
her
and
bent
over
and
touched
her
she
looked
up
at
him
out
of
wet
eyes
and
her
mouth
quivered
i
i
do
know
she
sobbed
if
he
truly
stole
away
my
soul
there
there
in
the
temple
dusk
of
yian
but
he
he
stole
my
heart
for
all
his
wickedness
sanang
prince
of
the
yezidees
and
i
have
been
fighting
him
for
it
all
these
years
all
these
long
years
fighting
for
what
he
stole
in
the
temple
dusk
and
now
now
i
have
it
back
my
heart
all
broken
to
pieces
here
on
the
floor
behind
your
your
bolted
door

on

unknown

the
eight
towers
of
the
assassins
guarded

still
guard
it
possibly
the
of
erlik
prince
of
darkness
dwelt
within
this
unknown
land
and
dwells
there
still
perhaps
in
front
of
this
stood
tressa
norne
behind
her
facing
the
map
four
men
were
seated
three
of
them
under
thirty
these
three
were
volunteers
in
the
service
of
the
united
states
government
men
of
independent
means
of
position
who
had
volunteered
for
military
duty
at
the
outbreak
of
the
great
war
however
they
had
been
assigned
by
the
government
to
a
very
different
sort
of
duty
no
less
exciting
than
service
on
the
fighting
line
but
far
less
conspicuous
for
they
had
been
drafted
into
the
united
states
department
of
justice
the
names
of
these
three
were
victor
cleves
a
professor
of
ornithology
at
harvard
university
before
the
war
alexander
selden
junior
partner
in
the
banking
firm
of
milwyn
selden
and
and
james
benton
a
new
york
architect
the
fourth
man
name
was
john
recklow
he
might
have
been
over
fifty
or
under
he
was
in
a
square
athletic
way
and
ruddy
quiet
in
voice
and
manner
his
hair
and
moustache
had
turned
silvery
he
had
been
employed
by
the
government
for
many
years
he
seemed
to
be
enormously
interested
in
what
miss
norne
was
saying
also
he
was
the
only
man
who
interrupted
her
narrative
to
ask
questions
and
his
questions
revealed
a
knowledge
which
was
making
the
girl
more
sensitive
and
uneasy
every
moment
finally
when
she
spoke
of
the
scarlet
desert
he
asked
if
the
scarlet
lake
were
there
and
if
the
xin
was
still
supposed
to
inhabit
its
vermilion
depths
and
at
that
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
her
forefinger
still
resting
on
the
map
where
have
you
ever
heard
of
the
scarlet
lake
and
the
xin
she
asked
as
though
frightened
recklow
said
quietly
that
as
a
boy
he
had
served
under
gordon
and
sir
robert
if
as
a
boy
you
served
under
chinese
gordon
you
already
know
much
of
what
i
have
told
you
recklow
is
it
not
true
she
demanded
nervously
that
makes
no
difference
he
replied
with
a
smile
it
is
all
very
new
to
these
three
young
gentlemen
and
as
for
myself
i
am
checking
up
what
you
say
and
comparing
it
with
what
i
heard
many
many
years
ago
when
my
comrade
barres
and
i
were
in
yian
did
you
really
know
sir
robert
hart
yes
then
why
do
you
not
explain
to
these
gentlemen
dear
child
he
interrupted
gently
what
did
chinese
gordon
or
sir
robert
hart
or
even
my
comrade
barres
or
i
myself
know
about
occult
asia
in
comparison
to
what
you
know
a
girl
who
has
actually
served
the
mysteries
of
erlik
for
four
amazing
years
she
paled
a
trifle
came
slowly
across
the
room
to
where
recklow
was
seated
laid
a
timid
hand
on
his
sleeve
do
you
believe
there
are
sorcerers
in
asia
she
asked
with
that
directness
which
her
wonderful
blue
eyes
corroborated
recklow
remained
silent
because
she
went
on
if
in
your
heart
you
do
not
believe
this
to
be
an
accursed
fact
then
what
i
have
to
say
will
mean
nothing
to
any
of
you
recklow
touched
his
short
silvery
moustache
hesitating
then
the
worship
of
erlik
is
devil
worship
he
said
also
i
am
entirely
prepared
to
believe
that
there
are
among
the
yezidees
adepts
who
employ
scientific
weapons
against
civilisation
who
have
probably
obtained
a
rather
terrifying
knowledge
of
psychic
laws
which
they
use
scientifically
and
which
to
ordinary
folk
appear
to
be
the
black
magic
of
sorcerers
cleves
said
the
employment
by
the
huns
of
poison
gases
and
cannon
is
a
parallel
case
before
the
war
we
could
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
cannon
that
threw
shells
a
distance
of
seventy
miles
the
girl
still
addressed
herself
to
recklow
then
you
do
not
believe
there
are
real
sorcerers
in
asia
mr
recklow
not
sorcerers
with
supernatural
powers
for
evil
only
degenerate
human
beings
who
somehow
have
managed
to
tap
invisible
psychic
currents
and
have
learned
how
to
use
terrific
forces
about
which
so
far
we
know
practically
nothing
she
spoke
again
in
the
same
uneasy
voice
then
you
do
not
believe
that
either
god
or
satan
is
involved
no
he
replied
smilingly
and
you
must
not
so
believe
nor
the
the
destruction
of
human
souls
she
persisted
you
do
not
believe
it
is
being
accomplished
not
in
the
slightest
dear
young
lady
he
said
cheerfully
do
you
not
believe
that
to
have
been
instructed
in
such
unlawful
knowledge
is
damning
do
you
not
believe
that
ability
to
employ
unknown
forces
is
forbidden
of
god
and
that
to
disobey
his
law
means
death
to
the
soul
no
that
it
is
the
price
one
pays
to
satan
for
occult
power
over
minds
she
insisted
hypnotic
suggestion
is
not
one
of
the
cardinal
sins
explained
recklow
still
smiling
unless
wickedly
employed
the
yezidee
priesthood
is
a
band
of
sorcerers
only
because
of
their
wicked
employment
of
whatever
hypnotic
and
psychic
knowledge
they
may
have
obtained
there
was
nothing
intrinsically
wicked
in
the
huns
discovery
of
phosgene
but
the
use
they
made
of
it
made
devils
out
of
them
my
ability
to
manufacture
phosgene
gas
is
no
crime
but
if
i
manufacture
it
and
use
it
to
poison
innocent
human
beings
then
in
that
sense
i
am
perhaps
a
sort
of
modern
sorcerer
tressa
norne
turned
paler
i
had
better
tell
you
that
i
used
forbidden
knowledge
which
the
yezidees
taught
me
in
the
temple
of
erlik
used
it
how
demanded
cleves
to
to
earn
a
living
and
once
or
twice
to
defend
myself
there
was
the
slightest
scepticism
in
recklow
bland
smile
you
did
quite
right
miss
norne
she
had
become
very
white
now
she
stood
beside
recklow
her
back
toward
the
suspended
map
and
looked
in
a
scared
sort
of
way
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
men
seated
before
her
turning
finally
to
cleves
and
coming
toward
him
i
i
once
killed
a
man
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
breath
cleves
reddened
with
astonishment
why
did
you
do
that
he
asked
he
was
already
on
his
way
to
kill
me
in
bed
you
were
perfectly
right
remarked
recklow
coolly
i
do
know
i
was
in
bed
and
then
on
the
edge
of
sleep
i
felt
his
mind
groping
to
get
hold
of
mine
feeling
about
in
the
darkness
to
get
hold
of
my
brain
and
seize
it
and
paralyse
it
all
colour
had
left
her
face
cleves
gripped
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
watched
her
intently
i
i
had
only
a
moment
mental
freedom
she
went
on
in
a
ghost
of
a
voice
i
was
just
able
to
rouse
myself
fight
off
those
murderous
let
loose
a
clear
mental
ray
and
then
o
god
i
saw
him
in
his
room
with
his
kalmuck
knife
saw
him
already
on
his
way
to
murder
me
gutchlug
khan
the
yezidee
looking
about
in
his
bedroom
for
a
shroud
and
when
when
he
reached
for
the
bed
to
draw
forth
a
fine
white
sheet
for
the
shroud
without
which
no
yezidee
dares
journey
deathward
then
i
became
frightened
and
i
killed
him
i
slew
him
there
in
his
hotel
bedroom
on
the
floor
above
mine
selden
moistened
his
lips
that
oriental
gutchlug
died
from
in
a
san
francisco
hotel
he
said
i
was
there
at
the
time
he
died
by
the
fangs
of
a
little
yellow
snake
whispered
the
girl
there
was
no
snake
in
his
room
retorted
cleves
and
no
wound
on
his
body
added
selden
i
attended
the
autopsy
she
said
faintly
there
was
no
snake
and
no
wound
as
you
say
yet
gutchlug
died
of
both
there
in
his
bedroom
and
before
he
died
he
heard
his
soul
bidding
him
farewell
and
he
saw
the
coiled
in
the
sheet
he
clutched
saw
the
thing
strike
him
again
and
again
saw
and
felt
the
tiny
wounds
on
his
left
hand
felt
the
fangs
pricking
deep
deep
into
the
veins
died
of
it
there
within
the
minute
died
of
the
swiftest
poison
known
and
yet
she
turned
her
face
to
cleves
and
yet
was
no
snake
and
never
had
been
and
so
i
i
ask
you
gentlemen
if
souls
do
not
die
when
minds
learn
to
fight
death
with
death
and
deal
it
so
swiftly
so
silently
while
one
body
lies
unstirring
on
a
bed
in
a
locked
room
on
the
floor
below
she
swayed
a
little
put
out
one
hand
rather
blindly
recklow
rose
and
passed
a
muscular
arm
around
her
cleves
beside
her
held
her
left
hand
crushing
it
without
intention
until
she
opened
her
eyes
with
a
cry
of
pain
are
you
all
right
asked
recklow
bluntly
yes
she
turned
and
looked
at
cleves
and
he
caressed
her
bruised
hand
as
though
dazed
tell
me
she
said
to
cleves
you
who
know
know
more
about
my
mind
than
anybody
living
a
painful
colour
surged
into
her
face
but
she
went
on
steadily
forcing
herself
to
meet
his
gaze
tell
me
cleves
do
you
still
believe
that
nothing
can
really
destroy
my
soul
and
that
it
shall
yet
win
through
to
safety
he
said
your
soul
is
in
god
keeping
and
always
shall
be
and
if
the
yezidees
have
made
you
believe
otherwise
they
lie
recklow
added
in
a
slow
perplexed
way
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
psychic
power
i
am
not
psychic
not
susceptible
but
if
you
actually
possess
such
ability
miss
norne
and
if
you
have
employed
such
knowledge
to
defend
your
life
then
you
have
done
absolutely
right
no
guilt
touches
you
added
selden
with
an
involuntary
shiver
if
by
hypnosis
or
psychic
ability
you
really
did
put
an
end
to
that
murderer
gutchlug
selden
said
if
gutchlug
died
by
the
fangs
of
a
yellow
which
existed
only
in
his
own
mind
and
if
you
actually
had
anything
to
do
with
it
you
acted
purely
in
you
did
your
full
duty
added
benton
but
good
god
it
seems
incredible
to
me
that
such
power
can
actually
be
available
in
the
world
recklow
spoke
again
in
his
pleasant
undisturbed
voice
go
back
to
the
map
miss
norne
and
tell
us
a
little
more
about
this
rather
terrifying
thing
which
you
believe
menaces
the
civilised
world
with
destruction
tressa
norne
laid
a
slim
finger
on
the
map
her
voice
had
become
steady
she
said
the
of
which
one
of
the
modern
developments
is
bolshevism
and
another
the
terrorism
of
the
hun
began
in
asia
long
before
christ
advent
at
least
so
it
was
taught
us
in
the
temple
of
erlik
it
has
always
existed
its
aim
always
has
been
the
annihilation
of
good
and
the
elevation
of
evil
the
subjection
of
right
by
might
and
the
worldwide
triumph
of
wrong
perhaps
it
is
as
old
as
the
first
battle
between
god
and
satan
i
have
wondered
about
it
sometimes
there
in
the
dusk
of
the
temple
when
the
eight
assassins
came
the
eight
all
in
white
chanting
the
yakase
of
sabbah
always
that
dirge
when
they
came
and
spread
their
eight
white
shrouds
on
the
temple
steps
her
voice
caught
she
waited
to
recover
her
composure
then
went
on
the
ambition
of
genghis
was
to
conquer
the
world
by
force
of
arms
it
was
merely
of
physical
subjection
that
he
dreamed
but
the
slayer
of
souls
who
asked
recklow
sharply
the
slayer
of
souls
erlik
on
earth
hassan
sabbah
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
it
is
of
him
i
am
speaking
exclaimed
tressa
norne
with
quiet
resolution
genghis
sought
only
physical
conquest
of
man
the
yezidee
ambition
is
more
awful
he
is
attempting
to
surprise
and
seize
the
very
minds
of
there
was
a
dead
silence
tressa
looked
palely
upon
the
four
the
yezidees
who
you
tell
me
are
not
sorcerers
are
using
power
which
you
tell
me
is
not
magic
accursed
by
god
to
waylay
capture
enslave
and
destroy
minds
and
souls
of
it
may
be
that
what
they
employ
is
hypnotic
ability
and
psychic
power
and
can
be
some
day
explained
on
a
scientific
basis
when
we
learn
more
about
the
occult
laws
which
govern
these
phenomena
but
could
anything
render
the
threat
less
awful
for
there
have
existed
for
centuries
perhaps
always
a
sect
of
satanists
determined
upon
the
destruction
of
everything
that
is
pure
and
holy
and
good
on
earth
and
they
are
resolved
to
substitute
for
righteousness
the
dreadful
reign
of
hell
in
the
beginning
there
were
comparatively
few
of
these
human
demons
gradually
through
the
eras
they
have
increased
in
the
twelfth
century
there
were
fifty
thousand
of
the
sect
of
assassins
beside
the
castle
of
the
slayer
of
souls
on
mount
alamout
she
laid
her
finger
on
the
map
eight
other
towers
were
erected
for
the
eight
chief
assassins
called
in
the
temple
we
were
taught
where
these
eight
towers
stood
she
picked
up
a
pencil
and
on
eight
blank
spaces
of
unexplored
and
unmapped
mongolia
she
made
eight
crosses
then
she
turned
to
the
men
behind
her
it
was
taught
to
us
in
the
temple
that
from
these
eight
of
infection
the
disease
of
evil
has
been
spreading
throughout
the
world
from
these
eight
towers
have
gone
forth
every
year
the
emissaries
of
evil
perverted
missionaries
to
spread
the
poisonous
propaganda
to
teach
it
to
tamper
stealthily
with
the
minds
of
men
dominate
them
pervert
them
instruct
them
in
the
creed
of
the
assassin
of
souls
all
over
the
world
are
people
already
contaminated
whose
minds
are
already
enslaved
and
poisoned
and
who
are
infecting
the
still
healthy
brains
of
others
stealthily
possessing
themselves
of
the
minds
of
mankind
teaching
them
evil
inviting
them
to
mock
the
precepts
of
christ
of
such
lost
minds
are
the
degraded
brains
of
the
germans
the
pastors
and
philosophers
who
teach
that
might
is
right
of
such
crippled
minds
are
the
bolsheviki
poisoned
long
long
ago
by
close
contact
with
asia
which
before
that
had
infected
and
enslaved
the
minds
of
the
ruling
classes
with
ferocious
philosophy
of
such
minds
are
all
anarchists
of
every
shade
and
stripe
all
terrorists
all
disciples
of
violence
the
murderously
envious
the
slothful
slinking
brotherhood
which
prowls
through
the
world
taking
every
opportunity
to
set
it
afire
those
mentally
dulled
by
reason
of
excesses
those
weak
intellects
become
unsound
through
futile
gabble
parlour
socialists
amateur
revolutionists
theoretical
incapables
excited
by
discussion
fit
only
for
healthy
minds
she
left
the
map
and
came
over
to
where
the
four
men
were
seated
terribly
intent
upon
her
every
word
in
the
temple
of
erlik
where
my
girlhood
was
passed
after
the
murder
of
my
parents
i
learned
what
i
am
repeating
to
you
she
said
i
learned
this
also
that
the
eight
towers
still
exist
still
stand
at
least
theoretically
and
that
from
the
eight
towers
pours
forth
across
the
world
a
stream
of
poison
i
was
told
that
to
every
country
eight
yezidees
were
allotted
eight
sorcerers
or
adepts
in
scientific
psychology
if
you
prefer
it
whose
mission
is
to
teach
the
gospel
of
hell
and
gradually
but
surely
to
win
the
minds
of
men
to
the
service
of
the
slayer
of
souls
that
is
what
was
taught
us
in
the
temple
we
were
educated
in
the
development
of
occult
powers
for
it
seems
all
human
beings
possess
this
psychic
power
latent
within
them
only
few
even
when
instructed
acquire
any
ability
to
control
and
use
this
force
i
i
learned
rapidly
i
even
thought
sometimes
that
the
yezidees
were
beginning
to
be
a
little
afraid
of
me
even
the
hassani
priests
and
the
spreading
their
shrouds
on
the
temple
steps
looked
at
me
with
unquiet
eyes
where
i
stood
like
a
corpse
amid
the
incense
clouds
she
passed
her
fingers
over
her
eyelids
then
framed
her
face
between
both
hands
for
a
moment
thought
lost
in
tragic
retrospection
kai
she
whispered
dreamily
as
though
to
herself
what
erlik
awoke
within
my
body
that
was
asleep
god
knows
but
it
was
as
though
a
twin
comrade
arose
within
me
and
looked
out
through
my
eyes
upon
a
world
which
never
before
had
been
visible
utter
silence
reigned
in
the
room
cleves
breathing
seemed
almost
painful
to
him
so
intently
was
he
listening
and
watching
this
girl
benton
hands
whitened
with
his
grip
on
the
selden
tense
absorbed
kept
his
keen
gaze
of
a
business
man
fastened
on
her
face
recklow
slowly
caressed
the
cold
bowl
of
his
pipe
with
both
thumbs
tressa
norne
strange
and
remote
eyes
subtly
altered
and
she
lifted
her
head
and
looked
calmly
at
the
men
before
her
i
think
that
there
is
nothing
more
for
me
to
add
she
said
the
red
spectre
of
anarchy
called
bolshevism
at
present
threatens
our
country
our
government
is
now
awake
to
this
menace
and
the
secret
service
is
moving
everywhere
great
damage
already
has
been
done
to
the
minds
of
many
people
in
this
republic
poison
has
spread
is
spreading
the
eight
towers
still
stand
the
eight
assassins
are
in
america
but
these
eight
assassins
know
me
to
be
their
enemy
they
will
surely
attempt
to
kill
me
i
do
believe
i
can
avoid
death
very
long
but
i
want
to
serve
my
country
and
and
mankind
they
have
to
get
me
first
said
cleves
bluntly
i
shall
not
permit
you
out
of
my
sight
recklow
said
in
a
musing
voice
and
these
eight
gentlemen
who
are
very
likely
to
hurt
us
also
are
the
first
people
we
ought
to
hunt
to
get
them
added
selden
we
ought
to
choke
the
stream
at
its
source
to
find
out
who
they
are
is
what
is
going
to
worry
us
added
benton
cleves
had
stood
holding
a
chair
for
tressa
norne
finally
she
noticed
it
and
seated
herself
as
though
tired
is
sanang
one
of
these
eight
he
asked
her
the
girl
turned
and
looked
up
at
him
and
he
saw
the
flush
mounting
in
her
face
sometimes
she
said
steadily
i
have
almost
believed
he
was
own
on
earth
the
slayer
of
souls
himself
benton
and
selden
had
gone
recklow
left
a
little
later
cleves
accompanied
him
out
to
the
landing
are
you
going
to
keep
miss
norne
here
with
you
for
the
present
inquired
the
older
man
yes
i
dare
not
let
her
out
of
my
sight
recklow
what
else
can
i
do
i
do
know
is
she
prepared
for
the
consequences
gossip
slander
of
course
i
can
get
a
housekeeper
that
only
makes
it
look
worse
cleves
reddened
well
do
you
want
to
find
her
in
some
hotel
or
apartment
with
her
throat
cut
no
replied
recklow
gently
i
do
not
then
what
else
is
there
to
do
but
keep
her
here
in
my
own
apartment
and
never
let
her
out
of
my
sight
until
we
can
find
and
lock
up
the
eight
gentlemen
who
are
undoubtedly
bent
on
murdering
her
is
there
some
woman
in
the
service
who
could
help
out
i
could
mention
several
i
tell
you
i
ca
trust
tressa
norne
to
anybody
except
myself
insisted
cleves
i
got
her
into
this
i
am
responsible
if
she
is
murdered
i
dare
not
entrust
her
safety
to
anybody
else
and
recklow
it
a
ghastly
responsibility
for
a
man
to
induce
a
young
girl
to
face
death
even
in
the
service
of
her
country
if
she
remains
here
alone
with
you
she
face
social
destruction
remarked
recklow
cleves
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
burst
out
well
what
am
i
to
do
what
is
there
left
for
me
to
do
except
to
watch
over
her
and
see
her
through
this
devilish
business
what
other
way
have
i
to
protect
her
recklow
you
could
offer
her
the
protection
of
your
name
suggested
the
other
carelessly
what
you
mean
marry
her
well
nobody
else
would
be
inclined
to
cleves
if
it
ever
becomes
known
she
has
lived
here
quite
alone
with
you
cleves
stared
at
the
elder
man
this
is
nonsense
he
said
in
a
harsh
voice
that
young
girl
want
to
marry
anybody
neither
do
i
she
does
wish
to
have
her
throat
cut
that
all
and
i
determined
she
sha
there
are
stealthier
assassins
cleves
the
slayers
of
reputations
it
goes
badly
with
their
victim
it
does
indeed
well
hang
it
what
do
you
think
i
ought
to
do
i
think
you
ought
to
marry
her
if
you
going
to
keep
her
here
suppose
she
does
mind
the
unconventionality
of
it
all
women
mind
no
woman
at
heart
is
unconventional
cleves
she
she
seems
to
agree
with
me
that
she
ought
to
stay
here
besides
she
has
no
money
no
relatives
no
friends
in
america
all
the
more
tragic
if
you
really
believe
it
to
be
your
duty
to
keep
her
here
where
you
can
look
after
her
bodily
safety
then
the
other
obligation
is
still
heavier
and
there
may
come
a
day
when
miss
norne
will
wish
that
you
had
been
less
conscientious
concerning
the
safety
of
her
pretty
throat
for
the
knife
of
the
yezidee
is
swifter
and
less
cruel
than
the
tongue
that
slays
with
a
smile
and
this
young
girl
has
many
years
to
live
after
this
business
of
bolshevism
is
dead
and
forgotten
in
our
republic
recklow
yes
you
think
i
might
dare
try
to
find
a
room
somewhere
else
for
her
and
let
her
take
her
chances
you
it
your
affair
i
know
hang
it
i
know
it
my
affair
i
unintentionally
made
it
so
but
ca
you
tell
me
what
i
ought
to
do
i
ca
what
would
do
do
ask
me
returned
recklow
sharply
if
you
not
man
enough
to
come
to
a
decision
you
may
turn
her
over
to
me
cleves
flushed
brightly
do
you
think
are
old
enough
to
take
my
job
and
avoid
scandal
recklow
cold
eyes
rested
on
him
if
you
like
he
said
i
assume
your
various
kinds
of
personal
responsibility
toward
miss
norne
cleve
visage
burned
i
shoulder
my
own
burdens
he
retorted
sure
i
knew
you
would
and
recklow
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
cleves
took
it
without
cordiality
standing
so
recklow
still
smiling
said
what
a
rotten
deal
that
child
has
had
is
having
her
father
and
mother
were
fine
people
did
you
ever
hear
of
dr
norne
she
mentioned
him
once
they
were
people
of
most
excellent
antecedents
and
no
money
norne
was
our
at
yarkand
in
the
province
of
sin
kiang
all
he
had
was
his
salary
and
he
lost
that
and
his
post
when
the
administration
changed
then
he
went
into
the
spice
trade
some
jew
syndicate
here
sent
him
up
the
yarkand
river
to
see
what
could
be
done
about
jade
and
gold
concessions
he
was
on
that
business
when
the
tragedy
happened
the
kalmuks
and
khirghiz
were
responsible
under
yezidee
instigation
and
there
you
are
and
here
is
his
child
cleves
back
by
some
miracle
from
that
flowering
hell
called
yian
believing
in
her
heart
that
she
really
lost
her
soul
there
in
the
temple
and
now
here
in
her
own
native
land
she
is
exposed
to
actual
and
hourly
danger
of
assassination
poor
kid
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
rottener
deal
cleves
their
hands
had
remained
clasped
while
recklow
was
speaking
he
spoke
again
clearly
amiably
to
lay
down
one
life
for
a
friend
is
fine
i
not
sure
that
finer
to
offer
one
honour
in
behalf
of
a
girl
whose
honour
is
at
stake
after
a
moment
cleves
grip
tightened
all
right
he
said
recklow
went
downstairs
chapter
vi
in
battle
cleves
went
back
into
the
apartment
he
noticed
that
miss
norne
door
was
ajar
to
get
to
his
own
room
he
had
to
pass
that
way
and
he
saw
her
seated
before
the
mirror
partly
undressed
her
dark
lustrous
hair
being
combed
out
and
twisted
up
for
the
night
whether
this
carelessness
was
born
of
innocence
or
of
indifference
mattered
little
he
suddenly
realised
that
these
conditions
would
do
and
his
first
feeling
was
of
anger
if
you
put
on
your
robe
and
slippers
he
said
in
an
unpleasant
voice
i
like
to
talk
to
you
for
a
few
moments
she
turned
her
head
on
its
charming
neck
and
looked
around
and
up
at
him
over
one
naked
shoulder
shall
i
come
into
your
room
she
inquired
no
when
you
got
some
clothes
on
call
me
i
quite
ready
now
she
said
calmly
and
drew
the
chinese
slippers
over
her
bare
feet
and
passed
a
silken
loop
over
the
silver
bell
buttons
on
her
right
shoulder
then
undisturbed
she
continued
to
twist
up
her
hair
following
his
movements
in
the
mirror
with
unconcerned
blue
eyes
he
entered
and
seated
himself
the
impatient
expression
still
creasing
his
forehead
and
altering
his
rather
agreeable
features
miss
norne
he
said
you
absolutely
convinced
that
these
people
mean
to
do
you
harm
is
that
true
of
course
she
said
simply
then
until
we
get
them
you
running
a
serious
risk
in
fact
you
live
in
hourly
peril
that
is
your
belief
is
it
she
put
the
last
peg
into
her
thick
curly
hair
lowered
her
arms
turned
dropped
one
knee
over
the
other
and
let
her
candid
gaze
rest
on
him
in
silence
what
i
mean
to
explain
he
said
coldly
is
that
as
long
as
i
induced
you
to
go
into
this
affair
i
responsible
for
you
if
i
let
you
out
of
my
sight
here
in
new
york
and
if
anything
happens
to
you
i
be
as
guilty
as
the
dirty
beast
who
takes
your
life
what
is
your
opinion
it
up
to
me
to
stand
by
you
now
is
it
i
had
rather
be
near
you
for
a
while
she
said
timidly
certainly
but
miss
norne
our
living
here
together
in
my
apartment
or
living
together
anywhere
else
is
never
going
to
be
understood
by
other
people
you
know
that
do
you
after
a
silence
still
looking
at
him
out
of
clear
unembarrassed
eyes
i
know
but
i
do
want
to
die
i
told
you
he
said
sharply
they
have
to
kill
me
first
so
all
right
but
how
about
what
i
am
doing
to
your
reputation
i
understand
i
suppose
you
do
you
very
young
once
out
of
this
blooming
mess
you
will
have
all
your
life
before
you
but
if
i
kill
your
reputation
for
you
while
saving
your
body
from
death
you
find
no
happiness
in
living
do
you
realise
that
yes
well
then
have
you
any
solution
for
this
problem
that
confronts
you
no
have
you
any
idea
to
suggest
i
do
do
want
to
die
she
repeated
in
an
unsteady
voice
he
bit
his
lip
and
after
a
moment
scowling
silence
under
the
merciless
scrutiny
of
her
eyes
then
you
had
better
marry
me
he
said
it
was
some
time
before
she
spoke
for
a
second
or
two
he
sustained
the
searching
quality
of
her
gaze
but
it
became
unendurable
presently
she
said
i
do
ask
it
of
you
i
can
shoulder
my
own
burdens
and
he
remembered
what
he
had
just
said
to
recklow
you
shouldered
more
than
your
share
he
blurted
out
you
are
deliberately
risking
death
to
serve
your
country
i
enlisted
you
the
least
i
can
do
is
to
say
my
affections
are
not
engaged
so
naturally
the
idea
of
of
marrying
anybody
never
entered
my
head
then
you
do
not
care
for
anybody
else
her
candour
amazed
and
disconcerted
him
no
he
looked
at
her
curiously
do
you
care
for
anybody
in
that
way
a
light
blush
tinted
her
face
she
said
gravely
if
we
really
are
going
to
marry
each
other
i
had
better
tell
you
that
i
did
care
for
prince
sanang
what
he
cried
astounded
it
seems
incredible
does
it
yet
it
is
quite
true
i
fought
him
i
fought
myself
i
stood
guard
over
my
mind
and
senses
there
in
the
temple
i
knew
what
he
was
and
i
detested
him
and
i
mocked
him
there
in
the
temple
and
i
loved
him
sanang
he
repeated
not
only
amazed
but
also
oddly
incensed
at
the
naïve
confession
yes
sanang
if
we
are
to
marry
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
do
you
think
so
certainly
he
replied
in
an
way
his
mind
still
grasping
at
the
thing
then
looking
up
do
you
still
care
for
this
fellow
she
shook
her
head
are
you
perfectly
sure
miss
norne
as
sure
as
that
i
am
alive
when
i
awake
from
a
nightmare
my
hatred
for
sanang
is
very
bitter
she
added
frankly
and
yet
somehow
it
is
not
my
wish
to
see
him
harmed
you
still
care
for
him
a
little
oh
no
but
ca
you
understand
that
it
is
not
in
me
to
wish
him
harm
no
girl
feels
that
way
once
having
cared
to
become
indifferent
to
a
familiar
thing
is
perhaps
natural
but
to
desire
to
harm
it
is
not
in
my
character
you
have
plenty
of
character
he
said
staring
at
her
you
do
think
so
do
you
why
not
because
of
what
i
said
to
you
on
the
that
night
it
was
shameful
was
it
you
behaved
like
many
a
thoroughbred
he
returned
bluntly
you
were
scared
bewildered
ready
to
bolt
to
any
shelter
offered
it
quite
true
i
did
know
what
to
do
to
keep
alive
and
that
was
all
that
interested
me
to
keep
on
living
having
lost
my
soul
and
being
afraid
to
die
and
find
myself
in
hell
with
erlik
he
said
is
that
absurd
notion
out
of
your
head
yet
i
do
know
i
ca
suddenly
believe
myself
safe
after
all
those
years
it
is
not
easy
to
root
out
what
was
planted
in
childhood
and
what
grew
to
be
part
of
one
during
the
tender
and
formative
period
you
ca
understand
cleves
you
ca
ever
feel
or
visualise
what
became
my
daily
life
in
a
region
which
was
half
paradise
and
half
hell
she
bent
her
head
and
took
her
face
between
her
fingers
and
sat
so
brooding
after
a
little
while
well
he
said
there
only
one
way
to
manage
this
affair
if
you
are
willing
miss
norne
she
merely
lifted
her
eyes
i
think
he
said
there
only
that
one
way
out
of
it
but
you
understand
he
turned
pink
it
will
be
quite
all
right
your
liberty
privacy
i
sha
bother
you
annoy
she
merely
looked
at
him
after
this
bolshevistic
flurry
is
settled
in
a
year
or
two
or
three
then
you
can
very
easily
get
your
freedom
and
you
have
all
life
before
you
he
rose
and
a
jolly
good
friend
in
me
a
good
comrade
miss
norne
and
that
means
you
can
count
on
me
when
you
go
into
business
or
whatever
you
decide
to
do
she
also
had
risen
standing
slim
and
calm
in
her
exquisite
chinese
robe
the
sleeves
of
which
covered
her
finger
tips
are
you
going
to
marry
me
she
asked
if
you
let
me
yes
i
will
it
so
generous
and
considerate
of
you
i
i
do
ask
it
i
really
do
but
do
and
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
he
forced
a
smile
nor
i
it
rather
a
crazy
thing
to
do
but
i
know
of
no
saner
alternative
so
we
had
better
get
our
license
and
that
settles
it
he
turned
to
go
and
on
her
threshold
his
feet
caught
in
something
on
the
floor
and
he
stumbled
trying
to
free
his
feet
from
a
roll
of
soft
white
cloth
lying
there
on
the
carpet
and
when
he
picked
it
up
it
unrolled
and
a
knife
fell
out
of
the
folds
of
cloth
and
struck
his
foot
still
perplexed
not
comprehending
he
stooped
to
recover
the
knife
then
straightening
up
he
found
himself
looking
into
the
colourless
face
of
tressa
norne
what
all
this
he
asked
this
sheet
and
knife
here
on
the
floor
outside
your
door
she
answered
with
difficulty
they
have
sent
you
your
shroud
i
think
are
not
those
things
yours
were
they
not
already
here
in
your
baggage
he
demanded
incredulously
then
realising
that
they
had
not
been
there
on
the
when
he
entered
her
room
a
few
moments
since
a
rough
chill
passed
over
him
the
icy
caress
of
fear
where
did
that
thing
come
from
he
said
hoarsely
how
could
it
get
here
when
my
door
is
locked
and
bolted
unless
there
somebody
hidden
here
hot
anger
suddenly
flooded
him
he
drew
his
pistol
and
sprang
into
the
passageway
what
the
devil
is
all
this
he
repeated
furiously
flinging
open
his
bedroom
door
and
switching
on
the
light
he
searched
his
room
in
a
rage
went
on
and
searched
the
and
kitchen
and
every
and
closet
always
aware
of
tressa
presence
close
behind
him
and
when
there
remained
no
tiniest
nook
or
cranny
in
the
place
unsearched
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
carpet
glaring
at
the
locked
and
bolted
door
he
heard
her
say
under
her
breath
this
is
going
to
be
a
sleepless
night
and
a
dangerous
one
and
turning
to
stare
at
her
saw
no
fear
in
her
face
only
excitement
he
still
held
clutched
in
his
left
hand
the
sheet
and
the
knife
now
he
thrust
these
toward
her
what
this
damned
foolery
anyway
he
demanded
harshly
she
took
the
knife
with
a
slight
shudder
there
is
something
engraved
on
the
silver
hilt
she
said
he
bent
over
her
shoulder
eighur
she
added
calmly
not
arabic
the
mongols
had
no
written
characters
of
their
own
she
bent
closer
studying
the
inscription
after
a
moment
still
studying
the
eighur
characters
she
rested
her
left
hand
on
his
shoulder
an
impulsive
unstudied
movement
that
might
have
meant
either
confidence
or
protection
look
she
said
it
is
not
addressed
to
you
after
all
but
to
a
symbol
a
series
of
numbers
that
is
my
designation
in
the
federal
service
he
said
sharply
oh
she
nodded
slowly
then
this
is
what
is
written
in
the
dialect
traced
out
in
eighur
characters
by
one
of
the
eight
assassins
the
slayer
of
souls
sends
this
shroud
and
this
knife
from
mount
alamout
such
a
blade
shall
divide
your
heart
this
sheet
is
for
your
corpse
after
a
grim
silence
he
flung
the
soft
white
cloth
on
the
floor
there
no
use
my
pretending
i
not
surprised
and
worried
he
said
i
do
know
how
that
cloth
got
here
do
you
it
was
sent
how
she
shook
her
head
and
gave
him
a
grave
confused
look
there
are
ways
you
could
not
understand
this
is
going
to
be
a
sleepless
night
for
us
you
can
go
to
bed
tressa
i
sit
up
and
read
and
keep
an
eye
on
that
door
i
ca
let
you
remain
alone
here
i
afraid
to
do
that
he
gave
a
laugh
not
quite
pleasant
as
he
suddenly
comprehended
that
the
girl
now
considered
their
to
be
reversed
are
planning
to
sit
up
in
order
to
protect
he
asked
grimly
amused
do
you
mind
why
you
blessed
little
thing
i
can
take
care
of
myself
how
funny
of
you
when
i
am
trying
to
plan
how
best
to
look
out
for
but
her
face
remained
pale
and
concerned
and
she
rested
her
left
hand
more
firmly
on
his
shoulder
i
wish
to
remain
awake
with
you
she
said
because
i
myself
fully
understand
this
she
looked
at
the
knife
in
her
palm
then
down
at
the
shroud
it
is
going
to
be
a
strange
night
for
us
she
sighed
let
us
sit
together
here
on
the
lounge
where
i
can
face
bolted
and
if
you
are
willing
i
am
going
to
turn
out
the
lights
she
suddenly
bent
forward
and
switched
them
off
because
i
must
keep
my
mind
on
guard
why
do
you
do
that
he
asked
you
ca
see
the
door
now
let
me
help
you
in
my
own
way
she
whispered
i
i
am
very
deeply
disturbed
and
very
very
angry
i
do
not
understand
this
new
menace
yezidee
that
i
am
i
do
not
understand
what
kind
of
danger
threatens
you
through
your
loyalty
to
me
she
drew
him
forward
and
he
opened
his
mouth
to
remonstrate
to
laugh
but
as
he
turned
his
foot
touched
the
shroud
and
an
uncontrollable
shiver
passed
over
him
they
went
close
together
across
the
dim
room
to
the
lounge
and
seated
themselves
enough
light
from
madison
avenue
made
objects
in
the
room
barely
discernible
sounds
from
the
street
below
became
rarer
as
the
hours
wore
away
the
iron
jar
of
trams
the
rattle
of
vehicles
the
harsh
warning
of
taxicabs
broke
the
stillness
at
longer
and
longer
intervals
until
save
only
for
that
immense
and
ceaseless
vibration
of
the
monstrous
iron
city
under
the
foggy
stars
scarcely
a
sound
stirred
the
silence
the
had
struck
long
ago
on
the
bell
of
the
little
clock
now
the
clear
bell
sounded
three
times
cleves
stirred
on
the
lounge
beside
tressa
again
and
again
he
had
thought
that
she
was
asleep
for
her
head
had
fallen
back
against
the
cushions
and
she
lay
very
still
but
always
when
he
leaned
nearer
to
peer
down
at
her
he
saw
her
eyes
open
and
fixed
intently
upon
the
bolted
door
his
pistol
which
still
rested
on
his
knee
was
pointed
across
the
room
toward
the
door
once
he
reminded
her
in
a
whisper
that
she
was
unarmed
and
that
it
might
be
as
well
for
her
to
go
and
get
her
pistol
but
she
murmured
that
she
was
sufficiently
equipped
and
in
spite
of
himself
he
shivered
as
he
glanced
down
at
her
frail
and
empty
hands
it
was
some
time
between
three
and
he
judged
when
a
sudden
movement
of
the
girl
brought
him
upright
on
his
seat
quivering
with
excitement
mr
cleves
yes
the
sorcerers
where
outside
the
door
oh
my
god
she
murmured
are
after
my
mind
their
fingers
are
groping
to
seize
my
brain
and
get
possession
of
it
what
he
stammered
horrified
here
in
the
dark
she
whispered
and
i
feel
their
fingers
caressing
me
searching
moving
stealthily
to
surprise
and
grasp
my
thoughts
i
know
what
they
are
doing
i
am
resisting
i
am
fighting
fighting
she
sat
bolt
upright
with
clenched
hands
at
her
breast
her
face
palely
aglow
in
the
dimness
as
though
illumined
by
some
vivid
inward
light
or
as
he
thought
from
the
azure
blaze
in
her
eyes
is
is
this
what
you
call
what
you
believe
to
be
magic
he
asked
unsteadily
is
there
some
hostile
psychic
influence
threatening
you
yes
i
resisting
i
fighting
fighting
they
shall
not
trap
me
they
shall
not
harm
you
i
know
how
to
defend
myself
and
you
and
suddenly
she
flung
her
left
arm
around
his
neck
and
the
delicate
clenched
hand
brushed
his
cheek
they
shall
not
have
you
she
breathed
i
am
fighting
i
am
holding
my
own
there
are
eight
of
them
eight
assassins
my
mind
is
in
battle
with
theirs
fiercely
in
battle
i
hold
my
own
i
am
armed
and
waiting
with
a
convulsive
movement
she
drew
his
head
closer
to
her
shoulder
eight
of
them
she
whispered
trying
to
entrap
and
seize
my
brain
but
my
thoughts
are
free
my
mind
is
defending
you
you
here
in
my
arms
after
a
breathless
silence
look
out
she
whispered
with
terrible
energy
they
are
after
mind
at
last
fix
your
thoughts
on
me
keep
your
mind
clear
of
their
net
do
let
their
ghostly
fingers

at
me

she
beseeched
him
in
an
agonised
whisper
ca
you
believe
in
me
for
a
moment
as
if
you
loved
me
his
heavy
lids
lifted
and
he
tried
to
look
at
her
can
you
see
me
you
he
muttered
something
in
a
confused
voice
victor
at
the
sound
of
his
own
name
he
opened
his
eyes
again
and
tried
to
straighten
up
but
his
pistol
fell
to
the
carpet
victor
she
gasped
clear
your
mind
in
the
name
of
god
i
can
not
i
tell
you
hell
is
opening
beyond
that
door
outside

bolted
door

will

you
if

love
of

burst
out
i
crucify
myself
for
you
if
you
look
at
me
if
you
only
fight
hard
enough
to
believe
in
me
as
though
you
loved
me
his
eyes
unclosed
but
he
sank
back
against
her
shoulder
victor
she
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
there
was
no
answer
if
the
love
of
god
could
only
hold
you
for
a
moment
more
she
stammered
with
her
mouth
against
his
ear
just
for
a
moment
victor
ca
you
hear
me
yes
very
far
away
fight
for
me
try
to
care
for
me
do
let
sanang
have
me
he
shuddered
in
her
arms
reached
out
and
resting
heavily
on
her
shoulder
staggered
to
his
feet
and
stood
swaying
like
a
drunken
man
no
by
god
he
said
thickly
sanang
shall
not
touch
you
the
girl
was
on
her
feet
now
holding
him
upright
with
an
arm
around
his
shoulders
they
ca
ca
harm
us
together
she
stammered
hark
listen
can
you
hear
oh

you
hear

me
my
pistol
he
tried
to
say
but
his
tongue
seemed
twisted
no
by
god
sanang
shall
not
touch
you
she
stooped
lithely
and
recovered
the
weapon
hush
she
said
close
to
his
burning
face
listen
our
minds
are
safe
i
can
hear
soul
bidding
its
body
farewell
she
burst
out
laughing
kicked
the
shroud
out
of
the
way
thrust
the
pistol
into
his
right
hand
went
forward
forcing
him
along
beside
her
and
drew
the
bolts
from
the
door
suddenly
he
spoke
distinctly
is
there
anything
outside
that
door
on
the
landing
yes
i
do
know
what
are
you
ready
she
laid
her
hand
on
lock
and
knob
he
nodded
at
the
same
instant
she
jerked
open
the
door
and
a
hunchback
who
had
been
picking
at
the
lock
fell
headlong
into
the
room
his
pistol
exploding
on
the
carpet
in
a
streak
of
fire
it
was
a
horrible
struggle
to
secure
the
powerful
misshapen
creature
for
he
clawed
and
squealed
and
bounced
about
on
the
floor
striking
blindly
with
arms
but
at
last
cleves
held
him
down
throttled
and
twitching
and
tressa
ripped
strips
from
the
shroud
to
truss
up
the
writhing
thing
then
cleves
switched
on
the
light
why
why
you
rat
he
exclaimed
in
hysterical
relief
at
seeing
a
living
man
whom
he
recognised
there
at
his
feet
what
are
you
doing
here
the
hunchback
red
eyes
blazed
up
at
him
from
the
floor
who

faltered

a
german
tailor
named
albert

he
looked
down
at
the
malignant
cripple
you
wanted
for
the
bomb
murder
albert
did
you
know
it
the
hunchback
licked
his
bloody
lips
then
he
kicked
himself
to
a
sitting
position
squatted
there
like
a
toad
and
looked
steadily
at
tressa
norne
out
of
small
eyes
blood
dripped
on
his
beard
his
huge
hairy
fists
tied
and
crossed
behind
his
back

odd
spasmodic
movements

went
to

lifted

shroud
and
kicked
it
across
the
hunchback
knees
so

of
the
huns
who
instigated
the
massacre
in

he
said
curiously
at
that
tressa
turned
very
white
and
a
cry
escaped
her
but
the
hunchback
features
were
all
twisted
into
ferocious
laughter
and
he
beat
on
the
carpet

heels
of

he
spat
at
her
and
rolled
over
in
his
shroud
the
girl
looking
down
on
him
closed
her
eyes
for
a
moment
and
cleves
saw
her
bloodless
lips
move
and
bent
nearer
listening
and
he
heard
her
whispering
to
herself

chapter
vii
the
bridal
over
the
united
states
stretched
an
unseen
network
of
secret
intrigue
woven
tirelessly
night
and
day
by
the
busy
enemies
of
civilisation
reds
terrorists
bolsheviki
social
faddists
and
amateur
meddlers
of
every
nuance
all
the
various
varieties
of
the
vicious
witless
and
mentally
unhinged
brought
together
through
the
cohesive
power
of
plunder
and
the
degeneration
of
cranial
tissue
all
over
the
united

the
various
departmental
divisions
of
the
secret
service
were
busily
following
up
these
threads
of
intrigue
leading
everywhere
through
the
obscurity
of
this
vast
and
secret
maze
to
meet
the
constantly
increasing
danger
of
physical
violence
and
to
uncover
secret
plots
threatening
sabotage
and
revolution
there
were
capable
agents
in
every
branch
of
the
secret
service
both
federal
and
state
but
in
the
first
months
of
something
more
terrifying
than
physical
violence
suddenly
threatened
civilised
america
a
wild
grotesque
incredible
threat
of
a
on
human
and
little
by
little
the
united
states
government
became
convinced
that
this
ghastly
menace
was
no
dream
of
a
disordered
imagination
but
that
it
was
real
that
among
the
enemies
of
civilisation
there
actually
existed
a
few
powerful
but
perverted
minds
capable
of
wielding
psychic
forces
as
terrific
weapons
that
by
the
sinister
use
of
psychic
knowledge
controlling
these
mighty
forces
the
very
minds
of
mankind
could
be
stealthily
approached
seized
controlled
and
turned
upon
civilisation
to
aid
in
the
world
destruction
in
terrible
alarm
the
government
turned
to
england
for
advice
but
sir
william
crookes
was
dead
however
in
england
sir
conan
doyle
immediately
took
up
the
matter
and
in
america
professor
hyslop
was
called
into
consultation
and
then
when
the
government
was
beginning
to
realise
what
this
awful
menace
meant
and
that
there
were
actually
in
the
united
states
possibly
half
a
dozen
people
who
already
had
begun
to
carry
on
a
diabolical
warfare
by
means
of
psychic
power
for
the
purpose
of
enslaving
and
controlling
the
very
minds
of
men
then
in
the
terrible
moment
of
discovery
a
young
girl
landed
in
america
after
fourteen
years
absence
in
asia
and
this
was
the
amazing
girl
that
victor
cleves
had
just
married
at
recklow
suggestion
and
in
the
line
of
professional
duty
and
moral
duty
perhaps
it
had
been
a
brief
ceremony
john
recklow
of
the
secret
service
was
there
also
benton
and
selden
of
the
same
service
the
bride
lips
were
unresponsive
cold
as
the
touch
of
the
unsteady
hand
she
looked
down
at
her
new
ring
in
a
blank
sort
of
way
gave
her
hand
listlessly
to
recklow
and
to
the
others
in
turn
whispered
a
timidly
comprehensive
thank
you
and
walked
away
beside
cleves
as
though
dazed
there
was
a
taxicab
waiting
tressa
entered
recklow
came
out
and
spoke
to
cleves
in
a
low
voice
do
worry
replied
cleves
dryly
that
why
i
married
her
where
are
you
going
now
inquired
recklow
back
to
my
apartment
why
do
you
take
her
away
for
a
month
cleves
flushed
with
annoyance
this
is
no
occasion
for
a
wedding
trip
you
understand
that
recklow
i
understand
but
we
ought
to
give
her
a
breathing
space
she
had
nothing
but
trouble
she
worn
out
cleves
hesitated
i
can
guard
her
better
in
the
apartment
is
it
safer
to
go
back
there
where
your
people
are
always
watching
the
street
and
house
day
and
night
in
a
way
it
might
be
safer
perhaps
but
that
girl
is
nearly
exhausted
and
her
value
to
us
is
unlimited
she
may
be
the
vital
factor
in
this
fight
with
anarchy
her
weapon
is
her
mind
and
it
got
to
have
a
chance
to
rest
cleves
with
one
hand
on
the
cab
door
looked
around
impatiently
do
also
conclude
that
the
psychic
factor
is
actually
part
of
this
damned
problem
of
bolshevism
recklow
cool
eyes
measured
him
do
my
god
recklow
i
do
know
after
what
my
own
eyes
have
seen
i
do
know
either
said
the
other
calmly
but
i
am
taking
no
chances
i
do
attempt
to
explain
certain
things
that
have
occurred
but
if
it
be
true
that
a
misuse
of
psychic
ability
by
foreigners
asiatics
among
the
anarchists
is
responsible
for
some
of
the
devilish
things
being
done
in
the
united
states
then
your
unparalleled
knowledge
of
the
occult
east
is
absolutely
vital
to
us
and
so
i
say
better
take
her
away
somewhere
and
give
her
mind
a
chance
to
recover
from
the
incessant
strain
of
these
tragic
years
the
two
men
stood
silent
for
a
moment
then
recklow
went
to
the
window
of
the
taxicab
i
have
been
suggesting
a
trip
into
the
country
cleves
he
said
pleasantly
into
the
real
country
somewhere
a
month
quiet
in
the
woods
perhaps
would
it
appeal
to
you
cleves
turned
to
catch
her
answer
i
should
like
it
very
much
she
said
in
that
odd
hushed
way
of
speaking
which
seemed
to
have
altered
her
own
voice
and
manner
since
the
ceremony
a
little
while
before
driving
back
to
his
apartment
beside
her
he
strove
to
realise
that
this
girl
was
his
wife
one
of
her
gloves
lay
across
her
lap
and
on
it
rested
a
slender
hand
and
on
one
finger
was
his
ring
but
victor
cleves
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
that
this
ring
really
signified
anything
to
him
that
it
had
altered
his
own
life
in
any
way
but
always
his
incredulous
eyes
returned
to
that
slim
finger
resting
there
unstirring
banded
with
a
narrow
circlet
of
virgin
gold
in
the
apartment
they
did
not
seem
to
know
exactly
what
to
do
or
say
what
attitude
to
assume
what
effort
to
make
tressa
went
into
her
own
room
removed
her
hat
and
furs
and
came
slowly
back
into
the
where
cleves
still
stood
gazing
absently
out
of
the
window
a
fine
rain
was
falling
they
seated
themselves
there
seemed
nothing
better
to
do
he
said
politely
in
regard
to
going
away
for
a
rest
you
care
for
the
north
woods
i
fancy
unless
you
like
winter
sports
do
you
i
like
sunlight
and
green
leaves
she
said
in
that
odd
still
voice
then
if
it
would
please
you
to
go
south
for
a
few
weeks
rest
would
it
inconvenience
you
her
manner
touched
him
my
dear
miss
norne
he
began
and
checked
himself
flushing
painfully
the
girl
blushed
too
then
when
he
began
to
laugh
her
lovely
bashful
smile
glimmered
for
the
first
time
i
really
ca
bring
myself
to
realise
that
you
and
i
are
married
he
explained
still
embarrassed
though
smiling
her
smile
became
an
endeavour
i
ca
believe
it
either
cleves
she
said
i
feel
rather
stunned
had
you
better
call
me
victor
under
the
circumstances
he
suggested
striving
to
speak
lightly
yes
it
will
not
be
very
easy
to
say
it
not
for
some
time
i
think
tressa
yes
yes
yes
victor
that
the
idea
he
insisted
with
forced
gaiety
the
thing
to
do
is
to
face
this
rather
funny
situation
and
take
it
amiably
and
with
good
humour
you
have
your
freedom
some
day
you
know
yes
i
know
and
we
already
on
very
good
terms
we
find
each
other
interesting
do
we
yes
it
even
seems
to
me
he
ventured
it
certainly
seems
to
me
at
times
as
though
we
are
approaching
a
common
basis
of
of
mutual
er
esteem
yes
i
i
do
esteem
you
mr
cleves
in
point
of
fact
he
concluded
surprised
we
friends
in
a
way
would
you
call
it
friendship
i
think
so
i
think
i
call
it
that
she
admitted
i
think
so
too
and
that
is
lucky
for
us
that
makes
this
crazy
situation
more
comfortable
less
well
perhaps
less
ponderous
the
girl
assented
with
a
vague
smile
but
her
eyes
remained
lowered
you
see
he
went
on
when
two
people
are
as
oddly
situated
as
we
are
they
likely
to
be
afraid
of
being
in
each
other
way
but
they
ought
to
get
on
without
being
unhappy
as
long
as
they
are
quite
confident
of
each
other
friendly
consideration
do
you
think
so
tressa
her
lowered
eyes
rested
steadily
on
her
yes
she
said
and
i
am
not
unhappy
or
afraid
she
lifted
her
blue
gaze
to
his
and
somehow
he
thought
of
her
barbaric
name
keuke
and
its
yezidee
significance
heavenly
azure
are
we
really
going
away
together
she
asked
timidly
certainly
if
you
wish
if
you
also
wish
it
mr
cleves
he
found
himself
saying
with
emphasis
that
he
always
wished
to
do
what
she
desired
and
he
added
more
gently
you
tired
tressa
tired
and
lonely
and
unhappy
tired
but
not
the
others
not
unhappy
no
are
you
lonely
not
with
you
the
answer
came
so
naturally
so
calmly
that
the
slight
sensation
of
pleasure
it
gave
him
arrived
only
as
an
agreeable
afterglow
we
go
south
he
said
i
so
glad
that
you
do
feel
lonely
with
me
will
it
be
warmer
where
we
are
going
mr
cleves
yes
you
poor
child
you
need
warmth
and
sunshine
do
you
was
it
warm
in
yian
where
you
lived
so
many
years
it
was
always
june
in
yian
she
said
under
her
breath
she
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
a
revery
he
watched
the
sensitive
face
almost
imperceptibly
it
changed
became
altered
younger
strangely
lovely
presently
she
looked
up
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
not
tressa
norne
at
all
he
saw
but
little
keuke
heavenly
azure
of
the
yezidee
temple
as
she
dropped
one
slim
knee
over
the
other
and
crossed
her
hands
above
it
it
was
very
beautiful
in
yian
she
said
yian
of
the
thousand
bridges
and
scented
gardens
so
full
of
lilies
even
after
they
took
me
to
the
temple
and
i
thought
the
world
was
ending
god
skies
still
remained
soft
overhead
and
his
weather
fair
and
golden
and
when
in
the
month
of
the
snake
the
eight
came
to
the
temple
to
spread
their
shrouds
on
the
steps
then
after
they
had
departed
chanting
the
prayers
for
the
dead
each
to
his
tower
of
silence
we
temple
girls
were
free
for
a
week
and
once
i
went
with
tchagane
a
girl
and
with
yulun
another
girl
and
we
took
our
keutch
which
is
our
luggage
and
we
went
to
the
yaïlak
or
summer
pavilion
on
the
lake
of
the
ghost
oh
wonderful
a
silvery
world
of
suns
and
of
moons
so
frail
that
the
at
has
more
substance
her
voice
died
out
she
sat
gazing
down
at
her
spread
fingers
on
one
of
which
gleamed
her
after
a
little
she
went
on
dreamily
on
that
week
each
three
months
we
were
free
if
a
young
man
should
please
us
free
he
repeated
to
love
she
explained
coolly
oh
he
nodded
but
his
face
became
rather
grim
there
came
to
me
at
the
yaïlak
she
went
on
carelessly
one
khassar
noïane
noïane
means
prince
all
in
a
surcoat
of
gold
tissue
with
green
vines
embroidered
and
wearing
a
green
cap
trimmed
with
dormouse
and
green
boots
inlaid
with
stiff
gold
he
was
so
young
a
boy
i
laughed
i
said
this
a
yaçaoul
an
of
prince
erlik
mocking
him
as
young
and
thoughtless
girls
mock
not
in
unfriendly
manner
though
i
would
not
endure
the
touch
of
any
man
at
all
and
when
i
laughed
at
him
this
eighur
boy
flew
into
such
a
rage
kai
i
was
amazed
squirrel
he
cried
angrily
at
me
the
yacaz
little
chatterer
little
mocker
of
men
it
is
ten
blows
with
a
stick
you
require
not
kisses
at
that
i
whistled
my
two
dogs
bars
and
alaga
for
i
did
not
think
what
he
said
was
funny
i
said
to
him
had
better
go
home
khassar
noïane
for
if
no
man
has
ever
pleased
me
where
i
am
at
liberty
to
please
myself
here
on
the
lake
of
the
ghost
then
be
very
certain
that
no
boy
can
please
here
or
anywhere
and
at
that
kai
what
did
he
say
that
monkey
she
looked
at
her
husband
her
splendid
eyes
ablaze
with
wrathful
laughter
and
made
a
gesture
full
of
angry
grace
he
cries
malignant
sorceress
of
yian
may
everything
high
about
you
become
a
sandstorm
and
everything
long
a
serpent
and
everything
broad
a
toad
and
everything
but
i
had
had
enough
victor
she
added
excitedly
and
i
made
a
wild
bee
bite
him
on
the
lip
what
do
you
think
of
such
a
courtship
she
cried
laughing
but
cleves
face
was
a
study
in
emotions
and
then
suddenly
the
laughing
mask
seemed
to
slip
from
the
bewitching
features
of
keuke
mongol
and
there
was
tressa
norne
tressa
cleves
disconcerted
paling
a
little
as
the
memory
of
her
impulsive
confidence
in
this
man
beside
her
began
to
dawn
on
her
more
clearly
i
i
sorry
she
faltered
you
think
me
silly
think
evil
of
me
perhaps
she
looked
into
his
troubled
eyes
then
suddenly
she
took
her
face
into
both
hands
and
covered
it
sitting
very
still
we
go
south
together
he
said
in
an
uncertain
voice
i
hope
you
will
try
to
think
of
me
as
a
friend
i
just
troubled
because
i
am
so
anxious
to
understand
you
that
is
all
i
i
troubled
too
because
i
am
anxious
that
you
should
think
well
of
me
will
you
try
always
she
nodded
i
want
to
be
your
friend
always
he
said
thank
you
mr
cleves
it
was
a
strange
spot
he
chose
for
tressa
strange
but
lovely
in
its
own
unreal
and
rather
spectral
fashion
where
a
mist
veiled
the
johns
and
made
exquisite
ghosts
of
the
palmettos
and
softened
the
sun
to
a
wafer
pasted
on
a
nacre
sky
it
was
a
still
country
where
giant
towered
fantastic
under
their
misty
camouflage
of
moss
and
swarming
with
small
birds
among
the
trees
the
stole
without
on
the
placid
glass
of
the
stream
the
eared
grebe
floated
there
was
no
wind
no
stirring
of
leaves
no
sound
save
the
muffled
splash
of
silver
mullet
the
breathless
whirr
of
a
or
the
hushed
rustle
of
lizards
in
the
woods
for
tressa
this
was
the
blessed
balm
that
heals
the
balm
of
silence
and
for
the
first
week
she
slept
most
of
the
time
or
lay
in
her
hammock
watching
the
swarms
of
small
birds
creeping
and
flitting
amid
the
labyrinths
of
the
at
her
very
door
it
had
been
a
little
club
house
before
the
war
this
bungalow
on
the
johns
at
orchid
hammock
its
members
had
been
few
and
wealthy
but
some
were
dead
in
france
and
flanders
and
some
still
remained
overseas
and
others
continued
busy
in
the
north
and
these
two
young
people
were
quite
alone
there
save
for
a
negro
cook
and
a
maid
and
an
aged
negro
who
wore
a
scarlet
waistcoat
and
cords
too
large
for
his
shrunken
body
and
who
pottered
pottered
through
the
fields
all
day
with
his
whip
clasped
behind
his
bent
back
and
the
pointers
ranging
wide
or
plodding
in
at
heel
with
red
tongues
lolling
twice
cleves
went
a
little
way
for
quail
using
benton
dogs
but
even
here
in
this
remote
spot
he
dared
not
move
out
of
view
of
the
little
house
where
tressa
lay
asleep
so
he
picked
up
only
a
few
brace
of
birds
and
confined
his
sport
to
impaling
scorpions
on
the
blade
of
his
knife
and
all
the
while
life
remained
unreal
for
him
his
marriage
seemed
utterly
unbelievable
he
could
not
realise
it
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
conditions
so
incomprehensible
also
ever
latent
in
his
mind
was
knowledge
that
made
him
restless
the
knowledge
that
the
young
girl
he
had
married
had
been
in
love
with
another
man
sanang
and
there
were
other
thoughts
thoughts
which
had
scarcely
even
taken
the
shape
of
questions
one
morning
he
came
from
his
room
and
found
tressa
on
the
veranda
in
her
hammock
she
had
her
in
her
lap
you
feel
better
much
better
he
said
gaily
saluting
her
extended
hand
yes
is
this
heavenly
i
begin
to
believe
it
is
life
to
me
this
world
and
the
scent
of
orange
bloom
and
the
stillness
of
paradise
itself
she
gazed
out
over
the
ghostly
river
not
a
wing
stirred
its
glassy
surface
is
this
dull
for
you
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
not
if
you
are
contented
tressa
you
so
nice
about
it
do
you
think
you
might
venture
a
day
real
shooting
no
i
think
i
wo
he
replied
on
my
account
well
yes
i
so
sorry
it
all
right
as
long
as
you
getting
rested
what
is
that
instrument
my
oh
is
that
what
it
called
she
nodded
touched
the
strings
he
watched
her
exquisite
hands
shall
i
she
inquired
a
little
shyly
go
ahead
i
like
to
hear
it
i
have
touched
it
in
months
not
since
i
was
on
the
steamer
she
sat
up
in
her
hammock
and
began
to
swing
there
and
played
and
sang
while
swinging
in
the
flecked
shadow
of
the
orange
bloom
isle
of
cispangou
isle
of
iris
isle
of
cherry
tell
your
tiny
maidens
merry
clouds
are
looming
over
you
all
your
ocean
but
a
ferry
ships
are
bringing
death
to
you
isle
of
cispangou
half
a
thousand
ships
are
sailing
captain
death
commands
each
crew
lo
the
ruddy
moon
is
paling
clouds
the
dying
moon
are
veiling
every
cloud
a
shroud
for
you
cispangou
she
explained
is
the
very
very
ancient
name
among
the
mongols
for
japan
it
not
exactly
a
gay
song
he
said
what
it
about
oh
it
a
very
ancient
song
about
the
mongol
invasion
of
japan
i
know
scores
and
scores
of
such
songs
she
sang
some
other
songs
afterward
she
descended
from
the
hammock
and
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
on
the
veranda
steps
i
wish
i
could
amuse
you
she
said
wistfully
why
do
you
think
i
bored
tressa
i
not
at
all
but
she
only
sighed
lightly
and
gathered
her
knees
in
both
arms
i
do
know
how
young
men
in
the
western
world
are
entertained
she
remarked
presently
you
do
have
to
entertain
me
he
said
smiling
i
should
be
happy
to
if
i
knew
how
how
are
young
men
entertained
in
the
orient
oh
they
like
songs
and
stories
but
i
do
think
you
do
he
laughed
in
spite
of
himself
do
you
really
wish
to
entertain
me
i
do
she
said
seriously
then
please
perform
some
of
those
tricks
of
magic
which
you
can
do
so
amazingly
well
her
dawning
smile
faded
a
trifle
i
do
i
have
she
hesitated
you
have
your
professional
paraphernalia
with
you
he
suggested
oh
as
for
that
do
you
need
it
for
some
things
some
kinds
of
things
i
do
other
things
he
waited
she
seemed
disconcerted
do
do
anything
you
do
wish
to
do
tressa
he
said
i
was
only
only
afraid
that
if
i
should
do
some
little
things
to
amuse
you
i
might
stir
stir
up
interfere
encounter
some
sinister
current
and
betray
myself
betray
my
whereabouts
well
for
heaven
sake
do
venture
then
he
said
with
emphasis
do
do
anything
to
stir
up
any
other
wireless
any
yezidee
i
am
wondering
she
reflected
just
what
i
dare
venture
to
do
to
amuse
you
do
bother
about
me
i
would
have
you
try
any
psychic
stunt
down
here
and
run
the
chance
of
stirring
up
some
asiatic
devil
somewhere
she
nodded
absently
occupied
with
her
own
thoughts
sitting
there
chin
on
hand
her
musing
eyes
intensely
blue
i
think
i
can
amuse
you
she
concluded
without
bringing
any
harm
to
myself
do
try
it
tressa
i
be
very
careful
now
sit
quite
still
closer
to
me
please
he
edged
closer
and
became
conscious
of
an
indefinable
freshness
in
the
air
that
enveloped
him
like
the
scent
of
something
young
and
growing
but
it
was
no
magic
odour
merely
the
virginal
scent
of
her
hair
and
skin
that
even
clung
to
her
summer
gown
he
heard
her
singing
under
her
breath
to
herself
and
murmuring
caressingly
in
an
unknown
tongue
then
suddenly
in
the
pale
sunshine
scores
of
little
birds
came
hovering
around
them
alighting
all
over
them
and
he
saw
them
swarming
out
of
the
mossy
festoons
of
the
scores
and
scores
of
tiny
birds
parula
warblers
mostly
all
flitting
fearlessly
down
to
alight
upon
his
shoulders
and
knees
all
keeping
up
their
sweet
dreamy
little
twittering
sound
this
is
wonderful
he
whispered
the
girl
laughed
took
several
birds
on
her
forefinger
this
is
nothing
she
said
if
i
only
dared
wait
a
moment
and
to
the
parula
warblers
go
home
little
friends
of
god
the
air
was
filled
with
the
musical
whisper
of
wings
she
passed
her
right
arm
around
her
husband
neck
look
at
the
river
she
said
good
god
he
blurted
out
and
sat
dumb
for
over
the
john
misty
surface
there
was
the
span
of
a
bridge
a
strange
marble
bridge
humped
up
high
in
the
centre
and
over
it
were
passing
thousands
of
people
he
could
make
them
out
vaguely
see
them
passing
in
two
streams
tinted
shapes
on
the
marble
bridge
and
now
on
the
farther
shore
of
the
river
he
was
aware
of
a
city
a
vast
one
with
spectral
pagoda
shapes
against
the
sky
her
arm
tightened
around
his
neck
he
saw
boats
on
the
river
like
the
grotesque
shapes
that
decorate
ancient
lacquer
she
rested
her
face
lightly
against
his
cheek
in
his
ears
was
a
far
confusion
of
voices
the
stir
and
movement
of
multitudes
noises
on
ships
boatmen
cries
the
creak
of
oars
then
far
and
sonorous
quavering
across
the
water
from
the
city
the
din
of
a
temple
gong
there
were
bells
too
very
sweet
and
silvery
camel
bells
bells
from
the
buddhist
temples
he
strained
his
eyes
and
thought
amid
the
pagodas
that
there
were
minarets
also
suddenly
clear
and
ringing
came
the
distant
muezzin
cry
there
is
no
other
god
but
god
it
is
noon
mussulmans
pray
the
girl
arm
slipped
from
his
neck
and
she
shuddered
and
pushed
him
from
her
there
was
nothing
now
on
the
river
or
beyond
it
but
the
curtain
of
hanging
mist
no
sound
except
the
cry
of
a
gull
sharp
and
querulous
in
the
vapours
overhead
have
have
you
been
amused
she
asked
what
did
you
do
to
me
he
demanded
harshly
she
smiled
and
drew
a
light
breath
like
a
sigh
god
knows
what
we
living
do
to
one
another
or
to
ourselves
she
said
i
only
tried
to
amuse
you
after
taking
counsel
with
the
birds
what
was
that
bridge
i
saw
the
bridge
of
ten
thousand
felicities
and
the
city
yian
you
lived
there
yes
he
moistened
his
dry
lips
and
stole
another
glance
at
this
very
commonplace
florida
river
sky
and
water
were
blank
and
still
and
the
ghostly
trees
stood
tall
reflected
palely
in
the
translucent
tide
you
merely
made
me
visualise
what
you
were
thinking
about
he
concluded
in
a
voice
which
still
remained
unsteady
did
you
nothing
he
was
silent
remembering
the
bells
and
the
enormous
murmur
of
a
living
multitude
and
there
were
the
birds
too
she
added
with
an
uncertain
smile
i
do
not
mean
to
worry
you
and
you
did
ask
me
to
amuse
you
i
do
know
how
you
did
it
he
said
harshly
and
the
details
those
thousands
and
thousands
of
people
on
the
bridge
and
there
was
one
quite
near
this
end
of
the
bridge
who
looked
back
a
young
girl
who
turned
and
laughed
at
us
that
was
yulun
who
yulun
i
taught
her
english
a
temple
girl
yes
from
black
china
how
could
you
make
see
he
demanded
why
do
you
ask
such
things
i
do
not
know
how
to
tell
you
how
i
do
it
it
a
dangerous
uncanny
knowledge
he
blurted
out
and
suddenly
checked
himself
for
the
girl
face
went
white
i
do
mean
uncanny
he
hastened
to
add
because
it
seems
to
me
that
what
you
did
by
juggling
with
invisible
currents
to
which
when
attuned
our
five
senses
respond
is
on
the
same
lines
as
the
wireless
telegraph
and
telephone
she
said
nothing
but
her
colour
slowly
returned
you
must
be
so
sensitive
he
added
i
no
doubt
that
it
all
quite
normal
quite
explicable
on
a
perfectly
scientific
basis
probably
it
no
more
mysterious
than
a
man
in
an
airplane
over
midocean
conversing
with
people
ashore
on
two
continents
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
and
evening
tressa
seemed
subdued
not
restless
not
nervous
but
so
quiet
that
sometimes
glancing
at
her
askance
cleves
involuntarily
was
reminded
of
some
lithe
young
creature
of
the
wilds
intensely
alert
and
still
immersed
in
fixed
and
dangerous
meditation
about
five
in
the
afternoon
they
took
their
golf
sticks
went
down
to
the
river
and
embarked
in
the
canoe
the
water
was
glassy
and
still
there
was
not
a
ripple
ahead
save
when
a
sleeping
gull
awoke
and
leisurely
steered
out
of
their
way
tressa
arms
and
throat
were
bare
and
she
wore
no
hat
she
sat
forward
wielding
the
bow
paddle
and
singing
to
herself
in
a
low
voice
you
feel
all
right
do
you
he
asked
oh
i
am
so
well
physically
now
it
really
wonderful
victor
like
being
a
child
again
she
replied
happily
you
not
much
more
he
muttered
she
heard
him
not
very
much
more
in
years
she
said
does
scripture
tell
us
how
old
our
lord
was
when
he
descended
into
hell
i
do
know
he
replied
startled
after
a
little
while
tressa
tranquilly
resumed
her
paddling
and
singing
and
eight
tall
towers
guard
the
route
of
human
life
where
at
all
hours
death
looks
out
holding
a
knife
rolled
in
a
every
man
humble
or
proud
mighty
or
bowed
death

a

remarked
cleves
that
some
of
those
songs
you
sing
are
devilish
creepy
tressa
looked
around
at
him
over
her
shoulder
saw
he
was
smiling
smiled
faintly
in
return
they
were
off
orchid
cove
now
the
hotel
and
cottages
loomed
dimly
in
the
silver
mist
voices
came
distinctly
across
the
water
there
were
people
on
the
golf
course
paralleling
the
river
laughter
sounded
from
the
veranda
they
went
ashore
chapter
viii
the
man
in
white
it
was
at
the
sixth
hole
that
they
passed
the
man
ahead
who
was
playing
all
alone
a
courteous
young
fellow
in
white
flannels
who
smiled
and
bowed
them
through
in
silence
they
thanked
him
drove
from
the
tee
and
left
the
polite
and
reticent
young
man
still
apparently
hunting
for
a
lost
ball
like
other
things
which
depended
upon
dexterity
and
precision
tressa
had
taken
most
naturally
to
golf
her
supple
muscles
helped
at
the
ninth
hole
they
looked
back
but
did
not
see
the
young
man
in
white
flannels
hammock
set
with
pine
and
palmetto
and
intervals
of
swamp
flanked
the
course
rank
bayberry
and
scrub
palmetto
bounded
the
fairgreen
on
every
blossoming
bush
hung
butterflies
palomedes
swallowtails
drugged
with
honey
their
gold
and
black
velvet
wings
conspicuous
in
the
sunny
mist
like
the
ceremonial
vestments
of
a
yezidee
executioner
murmured
the
girl
the
tchortchas
wear
red
when
they
robe
to
do
a
man
to
death
i
wish
you
could
forget
those
things
said
cleves
i
am
trying
i
wonder
where
that
young
man
in
white
went
cleves
searched
the
links
i
do
see
him
perhaps
he
had
to
go
back
for
another
ball
i
wonder
who
he
was
she
mused
i
do
remember
seeing
him
before
said
cleves
shall
we
start
back
they
walked
slowly
across
the
course
toward
the
tenth
hole
tressa
teed
up
drove
low
and
straight
cleves
sliced
and
they
walked
together
into
the
scrub
and
towards
the
woods
where
his
ball
had
bounded
into
a
bunch
of
palm
trees
far
in
among
the
trees
something
white
moved
and
vanished
probably
a
white
egret
he
remarked
knocking
about
in
the
scrub
with
his
midiron
it
was
that
young
man
in
white
flannels
said
tressa
in
a
low
voice
what
would
he
be
doing
in
there
he
asked
incredulously
merely
a
jungle
tressa
swamp
and
cypress
thorn
and
creeper
and
no
man
would
go
into
that
mess
if
he
could
there
is
no
bottom
to
those
swamps
but
i
saw
him
in
there
she
said
in
a
troubled
voice
but
when
i
tell
you
that
only
a
wild
animal
or
a
snake
or
a
bird
could
move
in
that
jungle
the
bog
is
one
vast
black
quicksand
there
death
in
those
depths
victor
yes
he
looked
around
at
her
she
was
pale
he
came
up
and
took
her
hand
inquiringly
i
do
feel
well
she
murmured
i
not
ill
you
understand
what
the
matter
tressa
she
shook
her
head
drearily
i
do
know
i
wonder
whether
i
should
have
tried
to
amuse
you
this
morning
you
do
think
you
stirred
up
any
of
those
yezidee
beasts
do
you
he
asked
sharply
and
as
she
did
not
answer
he
asked
again
whether
she
was
afraid
that
what
she
had
done
that
morning
might
have
had
any
occult
consequences
and
he
reminded
her
that
she
had
hesitated
to
venture
anything
on
that
account
his
voice
in
spite
of
him
betrayed
great
nervousness
now
and
he
saw
apprehension
in
her
eyes
also
why
should
that
man
in
white
have
followed
us
keeping
out
of
sight
in
the
woods
he
went
on
did
you
notice
about
him
anything
to
disturb
you
tressa
not
at
the
time
but
it
odd
i
ca
put
him
out
of
my
mind
since
we
passed
him
and
left
him
apparently
hunting
a
lost
ball
i
have
not
been
able
to
put
him
out
of
my
mind
he
seemed
civil
and
well
bred
he
was
perfectly
all
courtesy
and
smiles
i
think
perhaps
it
was
the
way
he
smiled
at
us
murmured
the
girl
everybody
in
the
east
smiles
when
they
draw
a
knife
he
placed
his
arm
through
hers
are
you
a
trifle
morbid
he
said
pleasantly
she
stooped
for
her
golf
ball
retaining
a
hold
on
his
arm
he
picked
up
his
ball
too
put
away
her
clubs
and
his
and
they
started
back
together
in
silence
evidently
with
no
desire
to
make
it
eighteen
holes
it
a
confounded
shame
he
muttered
just
as
you
were
becoming
so
rested
and
so
delightfully
well
to
have
anything
any
unpleasant
flash
of
memory
cut
in
to
upset
you
i
brought
it
on
myself
i
should
not
have
risked
stirring
up
the
sinister
minds
that
were
asleep
hang
it
all
and
i
asked
you
to
amuse
me
it
was
not
wise
in
me
she
said
under
her
breath
it
is
easy
to
disturb
the
unknown
currents
which
enmesh
the
globe
i
ought
not
to
have
shown
you
yian
i
ought
not
to
have
shown
you
yulun
it
was
my
fault
for
doing
that
i
was
a
little
lonely
and
i
wanted
to
see
yulun
they
came
down
the
river
back
to
the
canoe
threw
in
their
golf
bags
and
embarked
on
the
glassy
stream
over
the
calm
flood
stained
deep
with
crimson
the
canoe
glided
in
the
sanguine
evening
light
but
tressa
sang
no
more
and
her
head
was
bent
sideways
as
though
listening
always
listening
to
something
inaudible
to
cleves
something
very
very
far
away
which
she
seemed
to
hear
through
the
still
drip
of
the
paddles
they
were
not
yet
in
sight
of
their
landing
when
she
spoke
to
him
partly
turning
i
think
some
of
your
men
have
arrived
where
he
asked
astonished
at
the
house
why
do
you
think
so
i
think
so
they
paddled
a
little
faster
in
a
few
minutes
their
dock
came
into
view
it
funny
he
said
that
you
should
think
some
of
our
men
have
arrived
from
the
north
i
do
see
anybody
on
the
dock
it
recklow
she
said
in
a
low
voice
he
is
seated
on
our
veranda
as
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
house
let
alone
the
veranda
cleves
made
no
reply
he
beached
the
canoe
tressa
stepped
out
he
followed
carrying
the
golf
bags
a
mousy
light
lingered
in
the
shrubbery
bats
were
flying
against
a
sky
as
they
took
the
path
homeward
with
an
impulse
quite
involuntary
cleves
encircled
his
young
shoulders
with
his
left
arm
he
said
lightly
i
kill
any
man
who
even
looked
as
though
he
harm
you
he
smiled
but
she
had
not
missed
the
ugly
undertone
in
his
words
they
walked
slowly
his
arm
around
her
shoulders
suddenly
he
felt
her
start
they
halted
what
was
it
he
whispered
i
thought
there
was
something
white
in
the
woods
where
dear
he
asked
coolly
over
there
beyond
the
lawn
what
she
called
the
lawn
was
only
a
vast
sheet
of
pink
and
white
phlox
now
all
misty
with
the
whirring
wings
of
and
noctuidæ
the
oak
grove
beyond
was
dusky
cleves
could
see
nothing
among
the
trees
after
a
moment
they
went
forward
his
arm
had
fallen
away
from
her
shoulders
there
were
no
lights
except
in
the
kitchen
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
house
at
first
nobody
was
visible
on
the
screened
veranda
under
the
orange
trees
but
when
he
opened
the
swing
door
for
her
a
shadowy
figure
arose
from
a
chair
it
was
john
recklow
he
came
forward
bent
his
strong
white
head
and
kissed
tressa
hand
is
all
well
with
you
mrs
cleves
yes
i

of
course
said
cleves
all
right
i
a
coon
and
a
surrey
behind
your
house
so
cleves
went
around
in
the
dusk
and
sent
the
outfit
back
to
the
hotel
and
he
himself
carried
in
recklow
suitcase
then
tressa
went
away
to
give
instructions
and
the
two
men
were
left
together
on
the
dusky
veranda
well
said
recklow
quietly
cleves
went
to
him
and
rested
both
hands
on
his
shoulders
i
playing
absolutely
square
she
a
perfectly
fine
girl
and
have
her
chance
some
day
god
willing
her
chance
repeated
recklow
to
marry
whatever
man
she
will
some
day
care
for
i
see
said
recklow
drily
there
was
a
silence
then
she
simply
a
splendid
specimen
of
womanhood
said
cleves
earnestly
and
intensely
interesting
to
me
why
recklow
i
have
known
a
dull
moment
though
i
fear
she
has
known
many
why
why
well
being
married
to
a
a
sort
of
temporary
figurehead
shut
up
here
all
day
alone
with
a
man
of
no
particular
interest
to
her
do
you
interest
her
well
how
could
i
she
did
choose
me
because
she
liked
me
particularly
did
she
asked
recklow
still
more
drily
well
that
does
make
it
a
trifle
dull
for
you
both
not
for
me
said
the
younger
man
naïvely
she
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
women
i
ever
met
and
good
heavens
what
psychic
knowledge
that
child
possesses
she
did
a
thing
merely
to
amuse
me
he
checked
himself
and
looked
at
recklow
out
of
sombre
eyes
what
did
she
do
inquired
the
older
man
i
think
i
let
her
tell
you
if
she
wishes
and
that
reminds
me
why
did
you
come
down
here
recklow
i
want
to
show
you
something
cleves
may
we
step
into
the
house
they
went
into
a
little
lamplit
recklow
handed
a
newspaper
clipping
to
cleves
the
latter
read
it
standing
had
deadliest
gas
ready
for
germans
might
have
killed
washington
april
guarded
night
and
day
and
far
out
of
human
reach
on
a
pedestal
at
the
interior
department
exposition
here
is
a
tiny
vial
it
contains
a
specimen
of
the
deadliest
poison
ever
known
the
product
of
an
american
scientist
germany
escaped
this
poison
by
signing
the
armistice
before
all
the
resources
of
the
united
states
were
turned
upon
her
ten
airplanes
carrying
would
have
wiped
out
it
is
said
every
vestige
of
life
animal
and
vegetable
in
berlin
a
single
day
output
would
snuff
out
the
millions
of
lives
on
manhattan
island
a
drop
poured
in
the
palm
of
the
hand
would
penetrate
to
the
blood
reach
the
heart
and
kill
the
victim
in
agony
what
was
coming
to
germany
may
be
imagined
by
the
fact
that
when
the
armistice
was
signed
was
being
manufactured
at
the
rate
of
ten
tons
a
day
three
thousand
tons
of
this
most
terrible
instrument
ever
conceived
for
killing
would
have
been
ready
for
business
on
the
american
front
in
france
on
november
is
another
of
the
big
secrets
of
the
war
just
leaking
out
it
was
developed
in
the
bureau
of
mines
by
professor
lee
lewis
of
northwestern
university
evanston
who
took
a
commission
as
a
captain
in
the
army
the
poison
was
manufactured
in
a
specially
built
plant
near
cleveland
called
the
trap
because
every
workman
who
entered
the
stockade
went
under
an
agreement
not
to
leave
the
space
until
the
war
was
won
the
object
of
this
of
course
was
to
protect
the
secret
work
on
the
plant
was
started
eighteen
days
after
the
bureau
of
mines
had
completed
its
experiments
experts
are
certain
that
no
one
will
want
to
steal
the
sample
everybody
at
the
exposition
which
shows
what
secretary
department
is
doing
keeps
as
far
away
from
it
as
possible
when
cleves
had
finished
reading
he
raised
his
eyes
in
silence
that
vial
was
stolen
a
week
ago
said
recklow
gravely
by
a
young
man
who
killed
one
guard
and
fatally
wounded
the
other
was
there
any
statement
yes
i
followed
the
man
i
lost
all
trace
of
him
at
palm
beach
but
i
picked
it
up
again
at
ormond
now
i
cleves
you
do
mean
you
traced
him
here
exclaimed
cleves
under
his
breath
he
here
on
the
johns
river
somewhere
he
came
up
in
a
but
left
it
east
of
orchard
cove
benton
knows
this
country
he
covering
the
and
i
came
here
to
see
how
you
are
getting
on
and
to
warn
us
added
cleves
quietly
well
yes
he
got
that
stuff
it
deadlier
than
the
newspaper
suspects
and
i
guess
i
guess
cleves
he
one
of
those
damned
yezidee
or
sorcerers
as
they
call
them
one
of
that
sect
of
assassins
sent
over
here
to
work
havoc
on
feeble
minds
and
do
murder
on
the
side
why
do
you
think
so
because
the
dirty
beast
lugs
his
shroud
around
with
him
a
stolen
from
the
new
willard
in
washington
we
were
so
close
to
him
in
jacksonville
that
we
got
it
and
his
luggage
but
we
did
get
him
the
rat
god
knows
how
he
knew
we
were
waiting
for
him
in
his
room
he
never
came
back
to
get
his
luggage
but
he
stole
a
from
his
hotel
in
augustine
and
that
is
how
we
picked
him
up
again
then
at
palm
beach
we
lost
the
beggar
but
somehow
or
other
i
felt
it
in
my
bones
that
he
was
after
you
you
and
your
wife
so
i
sent
benton
to
ormond
and
i
went
to
palatka
benton
picked
up
his
trail
it
led
toward
you
toward
the
johns
and
the
reptile
has
been
here
hours
trying
to
nose
you
out
i
suppose
tressa
came
into
the
room
both
men
looked
at
her
cleves
said
in
a
guarded
voice
on
the
golf
links
at
orchard
cove
there
was
a
young
man
in
white
flannels
very
polite
and
courteous
to
us
but
tressa
thought
she
saw
him
slinking
through
the
woods
as
though
following
and
watching
us
my
man
probably
said
recklow
he
turned
quietly
to
tressa
and
sketched
for
her
the
substance
of
what
he
had
just
told
cleves
the
man
in
white
flannels
on
the
golf
links
said
cleves
was
well
built
and
rather
handsome
and
not
more
than
i
thought
he
was
a
jew
i
thought
so
too
said
tressa
calmly
until
i
saw
him
in
the
woods
and
then
and
then
suddenly
it
came
to
me
that
his
smile
was
the
smile
of
a
treacherous
shaman
sorcerer
and
the
idea
haunts
me
the
memory
of
those
smiling
men
in
white
men
who
smile
only
when
they
slay
when
they
slay
body
and
soul
under
the
iris
skies
of
yian
o
god
merciful
long
suffering
she
whispered
staring
into
the
east
deliver
our
souls
from
satan
who
was
stoned
and
our
bodies
from
the
snare
of
the
yezidee
chapter
ix
the
west
wind
the
night
grew
sweet
with
the
scent
of
orange
bloom
and
all
the
perfumed
darkness
was
vibrant
with
the
feathery
whirr
of
wings
tressa
had
taken
her
to
the
hammock
but
her
fingers
rested
motionless
on
the
strings
cleves
and
recklow
shoulder
to
shoulder
paced
the
moonlit
path
along
the
hedges
of
oleander
and
hibiscus
which
divided
garden
from
jungle
and
they
moved
cautiously
on
the
road
not
too
near
the
shadow
line
for
in
the
cypress
swamp
the
bloated
grey
death
was
awake
and
watching
under
the
moon
and
in
the
scrub
palmetto
the
death
moved
lithely
and
somewhere
within
the
dark
evil
of
the
jungle
a
man
in
white
might
be
watching
so
recklow
pistol
swung
lightly
in
his
right
hand
and
cleves
weapon
lay
in
his
and
they
strolled
leisurely
around
the
drive
and
up
and
down
the
walks
passing
tressa
at
regular
intervals
where
she
sat
in
her
hammock
with
the
across
her
knees
once
cleves
paused
to
place
two
pink
hibiscus
blossoms
in
her
hair
above
her
ears
and
the
girl
smiled
gravely
at
him
in
the
light
again
pausing
beside
her
hammock
on
one
of
their
tours
of
the
garden
recklow
said
in
a
low
voice
if
the
beast
would
only
show
himself
cleves
we
not
miss
him
have
you
caught
a
glimpse
of
anything
white
in
the
woods
only
the
night
mist
rising
from
the
branch
and
a
white
ibis
stealing
through
it
cleves
came
nearer
do
you
think
the
yezidee
is
in
the
woods
watching
us
tressa
yes
he
is
there
she
said
calmly
you
it
yes
recklow
stared
at
the
woods
we
ca
go
in
to
hunt
for
him
he
said
that
fellow
would
get
us
with
his
lewisite
gas
before
we
could
discover
and
destroy
him
suppose
he
waits
for
a
west
wind
and
squirts
his
gas
in
this
direction
whispered
cleves
there
is
no
wind
said
tressa
tranquilly
he
has
been
waiting
for
it
i
think
the
yezidee
is
very
patient
and
he
is
a
shaman
sorcerer
my
god
breathed
recklow
what
sort
of
hellish
things
has
the
old
world
been
dumping
into
america
for
the
last
fifty
years
an
ordinary
anarchist
is
bad
enough
but
this
new
breed
of
devil
these
yezidees
this
sect
of
assassins
hush
whispered
tressa
all
three
listened
to
the
great
howling
from
the
jungle
but
tressa
had
heard
another
sound
the
vague
stir
of
leaves
in
the
was
it
a
passing
breeze
was
a
night
wind
rising
she
listened
but
heard
no
brittle
clatter
from
the
victor
she
said
yes
tressa
if
a
wind
comes
we
must
hunt
him
that
will
be
necessary
either
we
hunt
him
and
get
him
or
he
kills
us
here
with
his
gas
said
recklow
quietly
if
the
night
wind
comes
said
tressa
we
must
hunt
the
darkness
for
the
yezidee
she
spoke
coolly
if
he
only
show
himself
muttered
recklow
staring
into
the
darkness
the
girl
picked
up
her
lute
caught
cleves
worried
eyes
fixed
on
her
suddenly
comprehended
that
his
anxiety
was
on
her
account
and
blushed
brightly
in
the
moonlight
and
he
saw
her
teeth
catch
at
her
underlip
saw
her
look
up
again
at
him
confused
if
i
dared
leave
you
he
said
i
go
into
the
hammock
and
start
that
reptile
this
wo
do
this
standing
pat
while
he
comes
to
some
deadly
decision
in
the
woods
there
what
else
is
there
to
do
growled
recklow
watch
said
the
girl
the
yezidee
if
there
is
no
he
may
tire
of
waiting
then
you
must
shoot
fast
very
very
fast
and
straight
but
if
the
comes
then
we
must
hunt
him
in
darkness
recklow
pistol
in
hand
stood
straight
and
sturdy
in
the
moonlight
gazing
fixedly
at
the
forest
cleves
sat
down
at
his
wife
feet
she
touched
her
tranquilly
and
sang
in
her
childish
voice
ring
buddha
bells
gilded
gods
are
listening
swing
swing
lily
bells
in
my
garden
glistening
now
i
hear
the
shaman
drum
now
the
scarlet
horsemen
come
through
the
chanting
of
the
throng
thunders
now
the
temple
gong
the
gold
gods
listen
in
my
garden
what
care
i
where
my
lily
bells
hang
mute
they
glisten
where
i
singing
to
my
lute
in
my
garden
what
care
i
who
is
dead
and
who
shall
die

the

temple
gong
what
are
you
singing
whispered
cleves
bells
of
yian
is
it
old
of
the
century
there
were
few
buddhist
bells
in
yian
then
it
is
lamaism
that
has
destroyed
the
mongols
and
that
has
permitted
the
creed
of
the
assassins
to
spread
the
devil
worship
of
erlik
he
looked
at
her
not
understanding
and
she
pale
slim
prophetess
in
the
moonlight
gazed
at
him
out
of
lost
eyes
eyes
which
saw
perhaps
the
bloody
age
of
men
when
mankind
took
the
devil
by
the
throat
and
all
mount
alamout
went
up
in
smoking
ruin
and
the
eight
towers
were
dark
as
death
and
as
silent
before
the
blast
of
the
silver
clarions
of
ghenghis
khan
something
is
stirring
in
the
forest
whispered
tressa
her
fingers
on
her
lips
damnation
muttered
recklow
it
the
wind
they
listened
far
in
the
forest
they
heard
the
clatter
of
they
waited
the
ominous
warning
grew
faint
then
rose
again
a
long
low
rattle
of
which
became
a
steady
monotone
we
hunt
said
recklow
bluntly
come
on
but
the
girl
sprang
from
the
hammock
and
caught
her
husband
arm
and
drew
recklow
back
from
the
hibiscus
hedge
use
me
she
said
you
could
never
find
the
yezidee
let
me
do
the
hunting
and
then
shoot
very
very
fast
we
got
to
take
her
said
recklow
we
dare
not
leave
her
i
ca
let
her
lead
the
way
into
those
black
woods
muttered
cleves
the
wind
is
blowing
in
my
face
insisted
recklow
we
better
hurry
tressa
laid
one
hand
on
her
husband
arm
i
can
find
the
yezidee
i
think
you
never
could
find
him
before
he
finds
you
victor
let
me
use
my
own
let
me
find
the
way
please
let
me
lead
please
victor
because
if
you
do
i
afraid
we
all
die
here
in
the
garden
where
we
stand
cleves
cast
a
haggard
glance
at
recklow
then
looked
at
his
wife
all
right
he
said
the
girl
opened
the
hedge
gate
both
men
followed
with
pistols
lifted
the
moon
silvered
the
forest
there
was
no
mist
but
a
blew
mournfully
through
palm
and
cypress
carrying
with
it
the
strange
disturbing
pungency
of
the
jungle
wild
unfamiliar
perfumes
the
acrid
aroma
of
swamp
and
rotting
mould
what
about
snakes
muttered
recklow
knee
deep
in
wild
phlox
but
there
was
a
deadlier
snake
to
find
and
destroy
somewhere
in
the
blotched
shadows
of
the
forest
the
first
sentinel
trees
were
very
near
now
and
tressa
was
running
across
a
ghostly
tangle
where
once
had
been
an
orange
grove
and
where
aged
and
dying
citrus
stumps
rose
stark
amid
the
riot
of
encroaching
jungle
she
circling
to
get
the
wind
at
our
backs
breathed
recklow
running
forward
beside
cleves
that
our
only
chance
to
kill
the
dirty
rat
catch
him
with
the
wind
at
our
backs
once
traversing
a
dry
hammock
where
streaks
of
moonlight
alternated
with
shadow
a
rattlesnake
sprang
his
goblin
alarm
they
could
not
locate
the
reptile
they
shrank
together
and
moved
warily
chilled
with
fear
once
too
clear
in
the
moonlight
the
grey
death
reared
up
from
bloated
folds
and
stood
swaying
rhythmically
in
a
horrible
shadow
dance
before
them
and
cleves
threw
one
arm
around
his
wife
and
crept
past
giving
death
a
wide
berth
there
in
the
checkered
moonlight
now
under
foot
the
dry
hammock
lay
everywhere
and
the
night
wind
blew
on
their
backs
then
tressa
turned
and
halted
the
two
men
with
a
gesture
and
went
to
her
husband
where
he
stood
in
the
palm
forest
and
laid
her
hands
on
his
shoulders
looking
him
very
wistfully
in
the
eyes
under
her
searching
gaze
he
seemed
oddly
to
comprehend
her
appeal
you
are
going
to
use
to
use
your
he
said
mechanically
you
are
going
to
find
the
man
in
white
yes
you
are
going
to
find
him
in
a
way
we
do
understand
he
continued
dully
yes
you
will
not
hold
me
in
in
horror
will
you
recklow
came
up
making
no
sound
on
the
spongy
palm
litter
underfoot
can
you
find
this
devil
he
whispered
i
think
so
does
your
finer
sense
knowledge
whatever
it
is
give
you
any
inkling
as
to
his
whereabouts
mrs
cleves
i
think
he
is
here
in
this
hammock
only
she
turned
again
with
swift
impulse
to
her
husband
only
if
you
if
do
not
hold
me
in
in
horror
because
of
what
i
do
there
was
a
silence
then
what
are
you
about
to
do
he
asked
hoarsely
slay
this
man
we
do
that
said
cleves
with
a
shudder
only
show
him
to
us
and
we
shoot
the
dirty
reptile
to
slivers
suppose
we
hit
the
jar
of
gas
said
recklow
after
a
silence
tressa
said
i
have
got
to
give
him
back
to
satan
there
is
no
other
way
i
understood
that
from
the
first
he
can
not
die
by
your
pistols
though
you
shoot
very
fast
and
straight
no
after
another
silence
recklow
said
you
had
better
find
him
before
the
wind
changes
we
hunt
down
wind
or
we
die
here
together
she
looked
at
her
husband
show
him
to
us
in
your
own
way
he
said
and
deal
with
him
as
he
must
be
dealt
with
a
gleam
passed
across
her
pale
face
and
she
tried
to
smile
at
her
husband
then
turning
down
the
hammock
to
the
east
she
walked
noiselessly
forward
over
the
fibrous
litter
the
men
on
either
side
of
her
their
pistols
poised
they
had
halted
on
the
edge
of
an
open
glade
ringed
with
young
pines
in
fullest
plumage
tressa
was
standing
very
straight
and
still
in
a
strange
supple
agonised
attitude
her
left
forearm
across
her
eyes
her
right
hand
clenched
her
slender
body
slightly
twisted
to
the
left
the
men
gazed
pallidly
at
her
with
tense
set
faces
knowing
that
the
girl
was
in
terrible
mental
conflict
against
another
mind
a
powerful
sinister
mind
which
was
seeking
to
grasp
her
thoughts
and
control
them
minute
after
minute
sped
the
girl
never
moved
locked
in
her
psychic
duel
with
this
other
brutal
mind
beating
back
its
terrible
which
were
attacking
her
fighting
for
mental
supremacy
struggling
in
silence
with
an
unseen
adversary
whose
mental
dominance
meant
death
suddenly
her
cry
rang
out
sharply
in
the
moonlight
and
then
all
at
once
a
man
in
white
stood
there
in
the
lustre
of
the
moon
a
young
graceful
man
dressed
in
white
flannels
and
carrying
on
his
right
arm
what
seemed
to
be
a
long
white
cloak
instantly
the
girl
was
transformed
from
a
living
statue
into
a
lithe
supple
lightly
moving
thing
that
passed
swiftly
to
the
west
of
the
glade
keeping
the
young
man
in
white
facing
the
wind
which
was
blowing
and
tossing
the
plumy
young
pines
so
it
is
young
man
with
whom
i
have
been
wrestling
here
under
the
moon
of
the
only
god
she
said
in
a
strange
little
voice
all
vibrant
and
metallic
with
menacing
laughter
it
is
i
keuke
mongol
replied
the
young
man
in
white
tranquilly
yet
his
words
came
as
though
he
were
tired
and
out
of
breath
and
the
hand
he
raised
to
touch
his
small
black
moustache
trembled
as
if
from
physical
exhaustion
yarghouz
she
exclaimed
why
did
i
not
know
you
there
on
the
golf
links
assassin
of
the
seventh
tower
and
why
do
you
come
here
with
your
shroud
over
your
arm
and
hidden
under
it
in
your
right
hand
a
flask
full
of
death
he
said
smiling
i
come
because
you
are
to
die
eyes
i
bring
you
your
shroud
and
he
moved
warily
westward
around
the
open
circle
of
young
pines
instantly
the
girl
flung
her
right
arm
straight
upward
yarghouz
i
hear
thee
heavenly
azure
another
step
to
the
west
and
i
shatter
thy
flask
of
gas
with
what
he
demanded
but
stood
discreetly
motionless
with
what
i
grasp
in
an
empty
palm
thou
knowest
yarghouz
i
have
heard
he
said
with
smiling
uncertainty
but
to
hear
of
force
that
can
be
hurled
out
of
an
empty
palm
is
one
thing
and
to
see
it
and
feel
it
is
another
i
think
you
lie
heavenly
azure
so
thought
gutchlug
and
died
of
a
yellow
snake
the
young
man
seemed
to
reflect
then
he
looked
up
at
her
in
his
frank
smiling
way
wilt
thou
listen
heavenly
eyes
i
hear
thee
yarghouz
listen
then
keuke
mongol
take
life
from
us
as
we
offer
it
life
is
sweet
erlik
like
a
spider
waits
in
darkness
for
lost
souls
that
flutter
to
his
net
you
think
my
soul
was
lost
there
in
the
temple
yarghouz
unutterably
lost
little
temple
girl
of
yian
therefore
live

as
a
gift
whose
gift

she
said
gravely
that
we
belong
to
god
and
we
return
to
him
now
then
yezidee
do
your
duty
as
i
do
mine
kai
at
the
sound
of
the
formula
always
uttered
by
the
sect
of
assassins
when
about
to
do
murder
the
young
man
started
and
shrank
back
the
west
wind
blew
fresh
in
his
startled
eyes
sorceress
he
said
less
firmly
you
leave
your
yiort
to
come
all
alone
into
this
forest
and
seek
me
why
then
have
you
come
if
not
to
submit
if
not
to
take
the
gift
of
life
if
not
to
turn
away
from
your
seducers
who
are
hunting
me
and
who
have
corrupted
you
yarghouz
i
come
to
slay
you
she
said
quietly
suddenly
the
man
snarled
at
her
flung
the
shroud
at
her
feet
and
crept
deliberately
to
the
left
be
careful
she
cried
sharply
look
what
you
about
stand
still
son
of
a
dog
may
your
mother
bewail
your
death
yarghouz
edged
toward
the
west
clasping
in
his
right
hand
the
flask
of
gas
sorceress
he
laughed
a
witch
of
thibet
prophesied
with
a
drum
that
the
three
purities
the
nine
perfections
and
the
nine
times
nine
felicities
shall
be
lodged
in
him
who
slays
the
treacherous
temple

keuke

there
is
more
magic
in
this
bottle
which
i
grasp
than
in
thy
mind
and
body
heavenly

i
pray
god
to
be
merciful
to
this
soul
i
send
to
erlik
all
the
time
he
was
advancing
edging
cautiously
around
the
circle
of
little
plumy
pines
and
already
the
wind
struck
his
left
cheek
yarghouz
khan
cried
the
girl
in
her
clear
voice
take
up
your
shroud
and
repeat
the
fatha
backward
laughed
the
young
man
as
do
you
keuke
mongol
heretic
she
retorted
do
you
also
refuse
to
name
the
ten

shouted
pale
with

and
fury

may
your

be
covered
with
putrefying
sores
may

yarghouz

your
word
then
the

of
gog
and
magog
you
young
witch
of
yian
that
a
khan
of
the
seventh
tower
need
fear
you
he
sneered
stealing
stealthily
westward
through
the
feathery
pines
i
give
thee
thy
last
chance
yarghouz
khan
she
said
in
an
excited
voice
that
trembled
recite
thy
prayer
naming
the
ten
because
with
their
holy
names
upon
thy
lips
thou
mayest
escape
damnation
for
i
am
here
to
slay
thee
yarghouz
take
up
thy
shroud
and
pray
the
young
man
felt
the
west
wind
at
the
back
of
his
left
ear
then
he
began
to
laugh
heavenly
eyes
he
said
thy
end
is
come
together
with
the
two
police
who
hide
in
the
pines
yonder
behind
thee
behold
the
bottle
magic
of
yarghouz
khan
and
he
lifted
the
glass
flask
in
the
moonlight
as
though
he
were
about
to
smash
it
at
her
feet
then
a
terrible
thing
occurred
the
entire
flask
glowed
red
hot
in
his
grasp
and
the
man
screamed
and
strove
convulsively
to
fling
the
bottle
but
it
stuck
to
his
hand
melted
into
the
smoking
flesh
then
he
screamed
again
or
tried
to
but
his
entire
lower
jaw
came
off
and
he
stood
there
with
the
awful
orifice
gaping
in
the
moonlight
stood
reeled
a
moment
and
then
and
his
whole
face
slid
off
leaving
nothing
but
a
bony
mask
out
of
which
burst
shriek
after
shriek
keuke
mongol
had
fainted
dead
away
cleves
took
her
into
his
arms
recklow
trembling
and
deathly
white
went
over
to
the
thing
that
lay
among
the
young
pines
and
forced
himself
to
bend
over
it
the
glass
flask
still
stuck
to
one
charred
hand
but
it
was
no
longer
hot
and
recklow
rolled
the
unspeakable
thing
into
the
white
shroud
and
pushed
it
into
the
swamp
an
evil
ooze
took
it
slowly
sucked
it
under
and
engulfed
it
a
few
stinking
bubbles
broke
recklow
went
back
to
the
little
glade
among
the
pines
a
young
girl
lay
sobbing
convulsively
in
her
husband
arms
asking
god
pardon
and
his
for
the
justice
she
had
done
upon
an
enemy
of
all
mankind
chapter
x
at
the
ritz
when
victor
cleves
telegraphed
from
augustine
to
washington
that
he
and
his
wife
were
on
their
way
north
and
that
they
desired
to
see
john
recklow
as
soon
as
they
arrived
john
recklow
remarked
that
he
knew
of
no
place
as
private
as
a
public
one
and
he
came
on
to
new
york
and
established
himself
at
the
ritz
rather
regally
to
dine
with
him
that
evening
were
two
volunteer
agents
of
the
united
states
secret
service
otherwise
james
benton
a
fashionable
architect
and
alexander
selden
sometime
junior
partner
in
the
house
of
milwin
selden
a
single
lamp
was
burning
in
the
rococo
room
under
its
veiled
glow
these
three
men
sat
conversing
in
guarded
voices
over
coffee
and
cigars
awaiting
the
advent
of
otherwise
victor
cleves
recently
professor
of
ornithology
at
cambridge
and
his
young
wife
tressa
known
officially
as
did
the
trip
south
do
cleves
any
good
inquired
benton
some
said
recklow
when
selden
and
i
saw
her
she
was
getting
better
i
suppose
that
affair
of
yarghouz
upset
her
pretty
thoroughly
yes
recklow
tossed
his
cigar
into
the
fireplace
and
produced
a
pipe
victor
cleves
upsets
her
more
he
remarked
why
asked
benton
astonished
she
beginning
to
fall
in
love
with
him
and
does
know
what
the
matter
with
her
replied
the
elder
man
drily
selden
noticed
it
too
benton
looked
immensely
surprised
i
supposed
he
said
that
she
and
cleves
considered
the
marriage
to
be
merely
a
temporary
necessity
i
did
imagine
that
they
cared
for
each
other
i
do
suppose
they
did
at
first
said
selden
but
i
think
interested
in
victor
and
i
do
see
how
he
can
help
falling
in
love
with
her
because
she
a
very
beautiful
thing
to
gaze
on
and
a
most
engaging
one
to
talk
to
she
about
the
prettiest
girl
i
ever
saw
admitted
benton
and
about
the
cleverest
all
the
same
all
the
same
well
cleves
has
her
drawbacks
you
know
as
a
real
wife
i
mean
recklow
said
there
is
a
fixed
idea
in
cleves
head
that
tressa
norne
married
him
as
a
last
resort
which
is
true
but
he
never
believe
she
changed
her
ideas
in
regard
to
him
unless
she
herself
enlightens
him
and
the
girl
is
too
shy
to
do
that
besides
she
believes
the
same
thing
of
him
there
a
mess
for
you
recklow
filled
his
pipe
carefully
in
addition
he
went
on
cleves
has
another
and
very
terrible
fixed
idea
in
her
charming
head
and
that
is
that
she
really
did
lose
her
soul
among
those
damned
yezidees
she
believes
that
cleves
though
kind
to
her
considers
her
merely
as
something
uncanny
something
to
endure
until
this
yezidee
campaign
is
ended
and
she
is
safe
from
assassination
benton
said
after
all
and
in
spite
of
all
her
loveliness
i
myself
should
not
feel
entirely
comfortable
with
such
a
girl
for
a
real
wife
why
demanded
recklow
well
good
heavens
john
those
uncanny
things
she
does
her
rather
terrifying
psychic
knowledge
and
ability
make
a
man
more
or
less
uneasy
he
laughed
without
mirth
for
example
he
added
i
never
was
nervous
in
any
physical
crisis
but
since
i
met
tressa
norne
to
be
frank
i
not
any
too
comfortable
in
my
mind
when
i
remember
gutchlug
and
sanang
and
albert
feke
and
that
dirty
reptile
yarghouz
and
when
i
recollect
that
girl
dealt
with
good
god
john
i
not
a
coward
i
hope
but
that
sort
of
thing
worries
me
recklow
lighted
his
pipe
he
said
in
the
government
campaign
against
these
eight
foreigners
who
have
begun
a
psychic
campaign
against
the
unsuspicious
people
of
this
decent
republic
with
the
purpose
of
surprising
overpowering
and
enslaving
the
minds
of
mankind
by
a
misuse
of
psychic
power
we
agents
of
the
secret
service
are
slowly
gaining
the
upper
hand
in
this
battle
of
minds
we
are
gaining
a
victory
but
we
are
winning
solely
and
alone
through
the
psychic
ability
and
the
loyalty
and
courage
of
a
young
girl
who
through
tragedy
of
circumstances
spent
the
years
of
her
girlhood
in
the
infamous
yezidee
temple
at
yian
and
who
learned
from
the
themselves
not
only
this
magic
of
the
mongol
sorcerers
but
also
how
to
meet
its
psychic
menace
and
defeat
it
he
looked
at
benton
shrugged
if
you
and
if
cleves
really
feel
the
slightest
repugnance
toward
the
strange
psychic
ability
of
this
brave
and
generous
girl
i
for
one
do
not
share
it
benton
reddened
it
is
exactly
repugnance
but
recklow
interrupted
sharply
do
you
realise
benton
what
she
already
accomplished
for
us
in
our
secret
battle
against
bolshevism
against
the
very
powers
of
hell
itself
led
by
these
mongol
sorcerers
of
the
eight
assassins
or
who
came
to
the
united
states
to
wield
the
dreadful
weapon
of
psychic
power
against
the
minds
of
our
people
and
to
pervert
them
and
destroy
all
civilisation
of
the
eight
chief
assassins
of
the
eight
towers
this
girl
already
has
discovered
and
identified
four
sanang
gutchlug
albert
feke
and
yarghouz
and
she
has
destroyed
the
last
three
he
sat
calmly
enjoying
his
pipe
for
a
few
moments
silence
then
five
of
this
sect
of
assassins
remain
five
sly
murderous
psychic
adepts
who
call
themselves
sorcerers
except
for
prince
sanang
i
do
not
know
who
these
other
four
men
may
be
i
have
a
notion
nor
have
you
nor
do
i
believe
that
with
all
the
resources
of
the
united
states
secret
service
we
ever
should
be
able
to
discover
these
four
except
for
the
astounding
spiritual
courage
and
psychic
experience
of
the
young
wife
of
victor
cleves
after
a
moment
selden
nodded
that
is
quite
true
he
said
simply
we
are
utterly
helpless
against
unknown
psychic
forces
and
i
for
one
feel
no
repugnance
toward
what
cleves
has
done
for
all
mankind
and
in
the
name
of
god
she
a
brave
girl
muttered
benton
but
it
terrible
to
possess
such
knowledge
and
horrible
to
use
it
recklow
said
the
horror
of
it
nearly
killed
the
girl
herself
have
you
any
idea
how
she
must
suffer
by
being
forced
to
employ
such
terrific
knowledge
by
being
driven
to
use
it
to
combat
this
menace
of
hell
can
you
imagine
what
this
charming
sensitive
tragic
young
creature
must
feel
when
with
powers
natural
to
her
but
unfamiliar
to
us
she
destroys
with
her
own
mind
and
demons
in
human
shape
who
are
about
to
destroy
her
talk
of
nerve
talk
of
abnegation
talk
of
perfect
loyalty
and
courage
there
is
more
than
these
in
tressa
cleves
there
is
that
dauntless
bravery
which
faces
worse
than
physical
death
because
the
child
still
believes
that
her
soul
is
damned
for
whatever
happened
to
her
in
the
yezidee
temple
and
that
when
these
yezidees
succeed
in
killing
her
body
erlik
will
surely
seize
the
soul
that
leaves
it
there
was
a
knocking
at
the
door
benton
got
up
and
opened
it
victor
cleves
came
in
with
his
young
wife
tressa
cleves
seemed
to
have
grown
since
she
had
been
away
taller
a
trifle
paler
yet
without
even
the
subtlest
hint
of
that
charming
maturity
which
the
young
and
happily
married
woman
invariably
wears
her
virginal
allure
now
verged
vaguely
on
the
delicate
edges
of
austerity
cleves
sunburnt
and
vigorous
looked
older
somehow
far
less
boyish
and
he
seemed
more
silent
than
when
nearly
seven
months
before
he
had
been
assigned
to
the
case
of
tressa
norne
recklow
selden
and
benton
greeted
them
warmly
to
each
in
turn
tressa
gave
her
narrow
hand
recklow
led
her
to
a
seat
a
servant
came
with
iced
fruit
juice
and
little
cakes
and
cigarettes
conversation
aimless
and
general
fulfilling
formalities
gradually
ceased
a
full
june
moon
stared
through
the
open
windows
searching
for
the
traditional
bride
perhaps
and
its
light
silvered
a
pale
and
lovely
figure
that
might
possibly
have
passed
for
the
pretty
ghost
of
a
bride
but
not
for
any
girl
who
had
married
because
she
was
loved
recklow
broke
the
momentary
silence
bluntly
have
you
anything
to
report
cleves
the
young
fellow
hesitated
my
wife
has
i
believe
the
others
turned
to
her
she
seemed
for
a
moment
to
shrink
back
in
her
chair
and
as
her
eyes
involuntarily
sought
her
husband
there
was
in
them
a
vague
and
troubled
appeal
cleves
said
in
a
sombre
voice
i
need
scarcely
remind
you
how
deeply
distasteful
this
entire
and
accursed
business
is
to
my
wife
but
she
is
going
to
see
it
through
whatever
the
cost
and
we
four
men
understand
something
of
what
it
has
cost
her
is
costing
her
in
violence
to
her
every
instinct
we
honour
her
the
more
said
recklow
quietly
we
could
honour
her
too
much
said
cleves
a
slight
colour
came
into
tressa
face
she
bent
her
head
but
recklow
saw
her
eyes
steal
sideways
toward
her
husband
still
bowed
a
little
in
her
chair
she
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
while
concerning
what
she
had
to
say
then
looking
up
at
john
recklow
i
saw
sanang
good
heavens
where
he
demanded
i
do
know
cleves
flushing
with
embarrassment
explained
she
saw
him
clairvoyantly
she
was
lying
in
the
hammock
you
remember
i
had
a
trained
nurse
for
her
after
what
happened
in
orchid
lodge
tressa
looked
miserably
at
recklow
dumbly
for
a
moment
then
her
lips
unclosed
i
saw
prince
sanang
she
repeated
he
was
near
the
sea
there
were
rocks
cottages
on
cliffs
and
very
brilliant
flowers
in
tiny
gardens
sanang
was
walking
on
the
cliffs
with
another
man
there
were
forests
inland
do
you
know
who
the
other
man
was
asked
recklow
gently
yes
he
was
one
of
the
eight
i
recognised
him
when
i
was
a
girl
he
came
once
to
the
temple
of
yian
all
alone
and
spread
his
shroud
on
the
pink
marble
steps
and
we
temple
girls
mocked
him
and
threw
stemless
roses
on
the
shroud
telling
him
they
were
human
heads
with
which
to
grease
his
toug
she
became
excited
and
sat
up
straighter
in
her
chair
and
her
strange
little
laughter
rippled
like
a
rill
among
pebbles
i
threw
a
big
rose
without
a
stem
upon
the
shroud
she
exclaimed
and
i
cried
out
which
means
and
i
mocked
him
saying
khagan
when
he
was
only
a
khan
of
course
and
i
laughed
and
rubbed
one
finger
against
the
other
crying
out
ia
glachakho
which
means
toug
is
anointed
and
which
was
very
impudent
of
me
because
djamouk
was
a
and
khan
of
the
fifth
tower
and
entitled
to
a
toug
and
to
eight
men
and
a
toughtchi
and
it
is
a
grave
offence
to
mock
at
the
anointing
of
a
toug
she
paused
breathless
her
splendid
azure
eyes
sparkling
with
the
memory
of
that
girlish
mischief
then
their
brilliancy
faded
she
bit
her
lip
and
stole
an
uncertain
glance
at
her
husband
and
after
a
pause
she
explained
in
a
very
subdued
voice
that
the
iagla
michi
or
action
of
greasing
the
toug
or
standard
was
done
when
a
severed
human
head
taken
in
battle
was
cast
at
the
foot
of
the
lance
shaft
stuck
upright
in
the
ground
you
see
she
said
sadly
we
temple
girls
being
already
damned
cared
little
what
we
said
even
to
such
a
terrible
man
as
djamouk
khan
and
even
had
the
ghost
of
old
tchinguiz
khagan
himself
come
to
the
temple
and
looked
at
us
out
of
his
tawny
eyes
i
think
we
might
have
done
something
saucy
tressa
pretty
face
was
spiritless
now
she
leaned
back
in
her
armchair
and
they
heard
an
unconscious
sigh
escape
her
she
murmured
to
herself
what
crazy
things
we
did
on
the
steps
yulun
and
i
so
long
so
long
ago
cleves
got
up
and
went
over
to
stand
beside
his
wife
chair
what
happened
is
this
he
said
heavily
during
my
convalescence
after
that
yarghouz
affair
she
found
herself
at
a
certain
moment
clairvoyant
and
she
thought
she
saw
she
see
sanang
and
an
asiatic
she
recognised
as
being
one
of
the
chiefs
of
the
assassins
sect
whose
name
is
djamouk
but
except
that
it
was
somewhere
near
the
sea
some
summer
colony
probably
on
the
atlantic
coast
she
does
not
know
where
this
pair
of
jailbirds
roost
and
this
is
what
we
have
come
here
to
report
benton
politely
appalled
tried
not
to
look
incredulous
but
it
was
evident
that
selden
and
recklow
had
no
doubts
of
course
said
recklow
calmly
the
thing
to
do
is
for
you
and
your
wife
to
try
to
find
this
place
she
saw
make
a
tour
of
all
such
resorts
until
cleves
recognises
the
place
she
saw
added
selden
and
to
recklow
he
added
i
believe
there
are
several
perfectly
genuine
cases
on
record
where
clairvoyants
have
aided
the
police
several
authentic
cases
said
recklow
quietly
but
benton
face
was
a
study
tressa
looked
up
at
her
husband
he
dropped
his
hand
reassuringly
on
her
shoulder
and
nodded
with
a
slight
smile
there
there
was
something
else
she
said
with
considerable
hesitation
something
not
quite
in
line
of
duty
perhaps
it
seems
to
concern
benton
added
cleves
smiling
what
is
it
inquired
selden
smiling
also
as
benton
features
froze
to
a
mask
let
me
tell
you
first
interrupted
cleves
that
my
wife
psychic
ability
and
skill
can
make
me
visualise
and
actually
see
scenes
and
people
which
god
knows
i
never
before
laid
eyes
upon
but
which
she
has
both
seen
and
known
and
one
morning
in
florida
i
asked
her
to
do
something
strange
something
of
that
sort
to
amuse
me
and
we
were
sitting
on
the
steps
of
our
cottage
you
know
the
old
at
orchid
and
the
first
i
knew
i
saw
in
the
mist
on
the
johns
a
chinese
bridge
humped
up
over
that
very
commonplace
stream
and
thousands
of
people
passing
over
it
and
a
city
beyond
the
town
of
yian
tressa
tells
me
and
i
heard
the
buddhist
bells
and
the
big
temple
gong
and
the
noises
in
streets
and
on
the
water
he
was
becoming
considerably
excited
at
the
memory
and
his
lean
face
reddened
and
he
gesticulated
as
he
spoke
it
was
astounding
recklow
there
was
that
bridge
and
all
those
people
moving
over
it
and
the
city
beyond
and
the
boats
and
shipping
and
the
vast
murmur
of
multitudes
and
then
there
on
the
bridge
crossing
toward
yian
i
saw
a
young
girl
who
turned
and
looked
back
at
my
wife
and
laughed
and
i
told
him
it
was
yulun
said
tressa
simply
a
playfellow
of
my
wife
in
yian
explained
cleves
but
if
she
were
really
chinese
she
did
look
like
what
are
my
own
notions
of
a
chinese
girl
yulun
came
from
black
china
said
cleves
i
taught
her
english
i
loved
her
dearly
i
was
her
most
intimate
friend
in
yian
there
ensued
a
silence
broken
presently
by
benton
and
where
do
i
appear
in
this
he
asked
stiffly
tressa
smile
was
odd
she
looked
at
selden
and
said
when
i
was
convalescent
i
was
lonely
i
made
one
evening
and
i
found
yulun
and
again
she
was
on
a
bridge
but
she
was
dressed
as
i
am
and
the
bridge
was
one
of
those
great
horrible
steel
monsters
that
sprawl
across
the
east
river
and
i
was
astonished
and
i
said
darling
are
you
really
here
in
america
and
in
new
york
or
has
a
demon
tangled
the
threads
of
thought
to
mock
my
mind
in
illness
then
yulun
looked
very
sorrowfully
at
me
and
wrote
in
arabic
characters
in
the
air
the
name
of
our
enemy
who
once
came
to
the
lake
of
ghosts
for
love
of
her
tougtchi
to
djamouk
the
fox
and
who
went
his
way
again
amid
our
scornful
laughter
he
is
a
demon
and
he
was
tangling
my
thread
of
thought
tressa
became
exceedingly
animated
once
more
she
rose
and
came
swiftly
to
where
benton
was
standing
and
what
do
you
think
she
said
eagerly
i
said
to
her
yulun
will
you
the
and
come
to
me
if
i
the
will
you
come
to
me
beloved
and
yulun
made
with
her
lips
after
a
silence
but
where
do
i
come
in
inquired
benton
stiffly
fearful
of
such
matters
you
in
i
do
understand
you
came
in
the
door
while
yulun
and
i
were
talking
when
when
you
came
to
see
me
after
i
was
better
and
you
and
selden
were
going
north
with
recklow
do
you
remember
i
was
lying
in
the
hammock
in
the
moonlight
and
victor
told
you
i
was
asleep
yes
of
course
i
was
not
asleep
i
had
the
and
i
was
with
yulun
i
did
not
know
you
were
standing
beside
my
hammock
in
the
moonlight
until
yulun
told
me
and
is
what
i
am
to
tell
you
yulun
saw
you
and
yulun
has
written
it
in
chinese
in
eighur
characters
and
in
arabic
tracing
them
with
her
forefinger
in
the
air
that
yulun
loveliest
in
yian
and
very
white
has
seen
her
heart
like
a
pink
pearl
afire
burning
between
your
august
hands
my
hands
exclaimed
benton
very
red
there
fell
an
odd
silence
nobody
laughed
tressa
came
nearer
to
benton
wistful
uncertain
shy
would
you
care
to
see
yulun
she
asked
well
no
he
said
startled
i
i
shall
not
deny
that
such
things
worry
me
a
lot
cleves
i
a
an
episcopalian
the
tension
released
selden
was
the
first
to
laugh
there
no
use
blinking
the
truth
he
said
we
up
against
something
absolutely
new
of
course
it
is
magic
it
can
of
course
be
explained
by
natural
laws
about
which
we
happen
to
know
nothing
at
present
recklow
nodded
what
do
we
know
about
the
human
mind
it
has
been
proven
that
no
thought
can
originate
within
that
mass
of
convoluted
physical
matter
called
the
brain
it
has
been
proven
that
the
brain
originates
thought
and
uses
the
brain
as
a
vehicle
to
incubate
it
what
do
we
know
about
thought
selden
much
interested
sat
cogitating
and
looking
at
cleves
but
benton
still
flushed
and
evidently
nervous
sat
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
full
moon
and
twisting
an
unlighted
cigarette
to
shreds
why
did
you
tell
benton
when
the
thing
occurred
down
there
at
orchid
lodge
the
night
we
called
to
say
asked
selden
curiously
tressa
gave
him
a
distressed
smile
i
was
afraid
he
would
believe
me
and
i
was
afraid
that
you
and
recklow
even
if
you
believed
it
might
not
like
like
me
any
the
better
for
for
being
clairvoyant
recklow
came
over
bent
his
handsome
grey
head
and
kissed
her
hand
i
never
liked
any
woman
better
nor
respected
any
woman
as
deeply
he
said
and
lifting
his
head
he
saw
tears
sparkling
in
her
eyes
my
dear
he
said
in
a
low
voice
and
his
firm
hand
closed
over
the
slim
fingers
he
had
kissed
benton
got
up
from
his
chair
went
to
the
window
turned
shortly
and
came
over
to
tressa
you
braver
than
i
ever
could
learn
to
be
he
said
shortly
i
ask
your
pardon
if
i
seem
sceptical
i
more
worried
than
incredulous
there
something
born
in
me
part
of
me
that
shrinks
from
anything
that
upsets
my
orthodox
belief
in
the
future
life
but
if
you
wish
me
to
see
this
this
girl
yulun
it
quite
all
right
she
said
softly
and
with
gentle
wonder
i
know
of
nothing
that
could
upset
your
belief
benton
there
is
only
one
god
and
if
mahomet
be
his
prophet
or
if
he
be
lord
buddha
or
if
your
lord
christ
be
to
the
most
high
i
do
not
know
all
i
know
is
that
god
is
god
and
that
he
prevailed
over
satan
who
was
stoned
and
that
in
paradise
is
eternal
life
and
in
hell
demons
hide
where
dwells
erlik
prince
of
darkness
benton
silent
and
secretly
aghast
at
her
theology
said
nothing
recklow
pleasantly
but
seriously
denied
that
satan
and
his
demons
were
actual
and
concrete
creatures
again
cleves
hand
fell
lightly
on
his
wife
shoulder
in
a
careless
gesture
of
reassurance
and
to
benton
no
soul
is
ever
lost
he
said
calmly
i
do
exactly
know
how
that
agrees
with
your
orthodoxy
benton
but
it
is
surely
so
i
do
know
myself
said
benton
i
hope
it
so
he
looked
at
tressa
a
moment
and
then
blurted
out
anyway
if
ever
there
was
a
soul
in
god
keeping
and
guarded
by
his
angels
it
your
wife
that
also
is
true
said
cleves
quietly
by
the
way
remarked
recklow
carelessly
i
arranged
to
have
you
stop
at
the
ritz
while
you
in
town
cleves
you
and
your
husband
are
to
occupy
the
apartment
adjoining
this
where
is
your
luggage
victor
in
our
apartment
that
wo
do
said
recklow
decisively
telephone
for
it
cleves
went
to
the
telephone
but
recklow
took
the
instrument
out
of
his
hand
and
called
the
number
the
voice
of
one
of
his
own
agents
answered
cleves
was
standing
alone
by
the
open
window
when
recklow
hung
up
the
telephone
tressa
on
the
sofa
had
been
whispering
with
benton
selden
looking
over
the
evening
paper
by
the
lamp
glanced
up
as
recklow
went
over
to
cleves
victor
he
said
your
man
has
been
murdered
his
throat
was
cut
his
head
was
severed
completely
your
luggage
has
been
ransacked
and
so
has
your
apartment
three
of
my
men
are
in
possession
and
the
local
police
seem
to
comprehend
the
necessity
of
keeping
the
matter
out
of
the
newspapers
what
was
in
your
baggage
nothing
said
cleves
ghastly
pale
all
right
we
have
your
effects
packed
up
again
and
brought
over
here
are
you
going
to
tell
your
wife
cleves
still
deathly
pale
cast
a
swift
glance
toward
her
she
sat
on
the
sofa
in
animated
conversation
with
benton
she
laughed
once
and
benton
smiled
at
what
she
was
saying
is
there
any
need
to
tell
her
recklow
not
for
a
while
anyway
all
right
i
suppose
the
yezidees
are
responsible
for
this
horrible
business
certainly
your
poor
servant
head
lay
at
the
foot
of
a
which
had
been
placed
upright
between
two
chairs
on
the
pole
were
tied
three
tufts
of
hair
from
the
dead
man
head
the
pole
had
been
rubbed
with
blood
that
mongol
custom
muttered
cleves
they
made
a
toug
and
it
the
murderous
devils
they
did
more
they
left
at
the
foot
of
your
bed
and
at
the
foot
of
your
wife
bed
two
white
sheets
and
a
knife
lay
in
the
centre
of
each
sheet
that
of
course
is
the
symbol
of
the
sect
of
assassins
cleves
nodded
his
body
as
he
leaned
there
on
the
window
sill
in
the
moonlight
trembled
but
his
face
had
grown
dark
with
rage
if
i
could
could
only
get
my
hands
on
one
of
them
he
whispered
hoarsely
be
careful
do
wear
a
face
like
that
your
wife
is
looking
at
us
murmured
recklow
with
an
effort
cleves
raised
his
head
and
smiled
across
the
room
at
his
wife
our
luggage
will
be
sent
over
shortly
he
said
if
you
tired
we
say
so
she
rose
and
the
three
men
came
to
make
their
adieux
and
pay
their
compliments
and
devoirs
then
with
a
smile
that
seemed
almost
happy
she
went
into
her
own
apartment
on
her
husband
arm
cleves
and
his
wife
had
connecting
bedrooms
and
a
between
here
they
paused
for
a
moment
before
the
always
formal
ceremony
of
at
night
there
were
roses
on
the
centre
table
tressa
dropped
one
hand
on
the
table
and
bent
over
the
flowers
they
seem
so
friendly
she
said
under
her
breath
he
thought
she
meant
that
she
found
even
in
flowers
a
refuge
from
the
solitude
of
a
loveless
marriage
he
said
quietly
i
think
you
will
find
the
world
very
friendly
if
you
wish
but
she
shook
her
head
looking
at
the
roses
finally
he
said
and
she
extended
her
hand
and
he
took
it
formally
then
their
hands
fell
away
tressa
turned
and
went
toward
her
bedroom
at
the
door
she
stopped
turned
slowly
what
shall
i
do
about
yulun
she
asked
what
is
there
to
do
yulun
is
in
china
yes
her
body
is
do
you
mean
that
the
rest
of
her
whatever
it
is
could
come
here
why
of
course
so
that
benton
could
see
her
yes
could
he
see
her
just
as
she
is
her
face
and
figure
clothes
and
everything
yes
would
she
seem
real
or
like
a
ghost
spirit
whatever
you
choose
to
call
such
things
tressa
smiled
she
be
exactly
as
real
as
you
or
i
victor
she
seem
like
anybody
else
that
astonishing
he
muttered
could
benton
hear
her
speak
certainly
talk
to
her
tressa
laughed
of
course
if
yulun
should
the
she
could
leave
her
body
as
easily
as
she
undresses
herself
it
is
no
more
difficult
to
divest
one
self
of
one
body
than
it
is
to
put
off
one
garment
and
put
on
another
and
somehow
i
think
yulun
will
do
it
come
it
would
be
like
her
tressa
laughed
is
it
odd
that
she
should
have
become
so
enamoured
of
benton
just
seeing
him
there
in
the
moonlight
that
night
at
orchid
lodge
for
a
moment
the
smile
curved
her
lips
then
the
shadow
fell
again
across
her
eyes
veiling
them
in
that
strange
and
lovely
way
which
cleves
knew
so
well
and
he
looked
into
her
impenetrable
eyes
in
troubled
silence
victor
she
said
in
a
low
voice
were
you
afraid
to
tell
me
that
your
man
had
been
murdered
after
a
moment
you
always
know
everything
he
said
unsteadily
when
did
you
learn
it
just
before
recklow
told
you
how
did
you
learn
it
tressa
i
looked
into
our
apartment
when
while
you
were
telephoning
you
mean
you
looked
into
our
rooms
from
yes
clairvoyantly
what
did
you
see
the
iaglamichi
she
said
with
a
shudder
kai
the
toug
of
djamouk
is
anointed
at
last
is
that
the
beast
of
a
mongol
who
did
this
murder
djamouk
and
prince
sanang
planned
it
she
said
trembling
a
little
but
that
butchery
was
yaddin
work
i
think
kai
the
work
of
tougtchi
to
djamouk
the
fox
they
stood
confronting
each
other
the
length
of
the
between
them
and
after
the
silence
had
lasted
a
full
minute
cleves
reddened
and
said
i
am
going
to
sleep
on
the
couch
at
the
foot
of
your
bed
tressa
his
young
wife
reddened
too
he
said
this
affair
has
thoroughly
scared
me
i
ca
let
you
sleep
out
of
my
sight
i
am
quite
safe
and
you
would
have
an
uncomfortable
night
she
murmured
do
you
mind
if
i
sleep
on
the
couch
tressa
no
will
you
call
me
when
you
are
ready
yes
she
went
into
her
bedroom
and
closed
the
door
when
he
was
ready
he
slipped
a
pistol
into
the
pocket
of
his
belted
it
over
his
pyjamas
and
walked
into
the
his
wife
called
him
presently
and
he
went
in
her
was
burning
and
she
extended
her
hand
to
extinguish
it
could
you
sleep
if
it
burns
he
asked
bluntly
yes
then
let
it
burn
this
business
has
got
on
my
nerves
he
muttered
they
looked
at
each
other
in
an
expressionless
way
both
really
understood
how
useless
was
this
symbol
of
protection
this
man
the
girl
called
husband
how
utterly
useless
his
physical
strength
and
the
pistol
sagging
in
the
pocket
of
his
both
understood
that
the
only
real
protection
to
be
looked
for
must
come
from
her
from
the
gifted
and
guardian
mind
of
this
young
girl
who
lay
there
looking
at
him
from
the
pillows
he
said
flushing
i
do
my
best
but
only
one
of
envoys
like
you
knows
how
to
do
battle
with
things
that
come
out
of
hell
after
a
moment
silence
she
said
in
a
colourless
voice
i
wish
lie
down
on
the
bed
had
you
rather
i
did
yes
so
he
went
slowly
to
the
bed
placed
his
pistol
under
the
pillow
drew
his
around
him
and
lay
down
after
he
had
lain
unstirring
for
half
an
hour
try
to
sleep
tressa
he
said
without
turning
his
head
ca
you
seem
to
sleep
victor
she
asked
and
he
heard
her
turn
her
head
no
shall
i
help
you
do
you
mean
use
hypnosis
the
power
of
suggestion
on
me

gently

my

chapter
xi
yulun
the
beloved
cleves
opened
his
eyes
he
was
lying
on
his
left
side
in
the
pink
glow
of
the
he
saw
his
wife
in
her
seated
sideways
on
the
farther
edge
of
the
bed
talking
to
a
young
girl
the
strange
girl
wore
what
appeared
to
be
a
of
frail
gold
tissue
that
clung
to
her
body
and
glittered
as
she
moved
he
had
never
before
seen
such
a
dress
but
he
had
seen
the
girl
he
recognised
her
instantly
as
the
girl
he
had
seen
turn
to
look
back
at
tressa
as
she
crossed
the
phantom
bridge
over
that
misty
florida
river
and
cleves
comprehended
that
he
was
looking
at
yulun
but
this
charming
young
thing
was
no
ghost
no
astral
projection
this
girl
was
warm
living
breathing
flesh
the
delicate
scent
of
her
strange
garments
and
of
her
hair
her
very
breath
was
in
the
air
of
the
room
her
but
laughing
voice
was
deliciously
human
her
delicate
little
hands
caressing
tressa
were
too
eagerly
real
to
doubt
both
talked
at
the
same
time
their
animated
voices
mingling
in
the
breathless
delight
of
the
reunion
their
exclamations
enchanting
laughter
bubbling
chatter
filled
his
ears
but
not
one
word
of
what
they
were
saying
to
each
other
could
he
understand
suddenly
tressa
looked
over
her
shoulder
and
met
his
astonished
eyes
tokhta
she
exclaimed
yulun
my
lord
is
awake
yulun
swung
around
swiftly
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
looked
laughingly
at
cleves
but
when
her
red
lips
unclosed
she
spoke
to
tressa
and
darling
she
said
in
english
i
think
your
dear
lord
remembers
that
he
saw
me
on
the
bridge
of
dreams
and
heard
the
bells
of
yian
across
the
mist
tressa
said
laughing
at
her
husband
this
is
yulun
very
white
loveliest
in
yian
on
the
steps
of
the
yezidee
temple
she
flung
a
stemless
rose
upon
djamouk
shroud
where
he
had
spread
it
like
a
patch
of
snow
in
the
sun
and
at
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
where
there
is
freedom
to
love
for
those
who
desire
love
came
yaddin
tougtchi
to
djamouk
the
fox
in
search
of
love
and
yulun
and
tell
my
dear
lord
yulun
yulun
laughed
at
cleves
out
of
her
dark
eyes
that
slanted
charmingly
at
the
corners
kai
she
cried
softly
clapping
her
palms
i
took
his
roses
and
tore
them
with
my
hands
till
their
petals
rained
on
him
and
their
golden
hearts
were
a
powdery
cloud
floating
across
the
water
i
said
the
damned
do
not
mate
with
demons
my
tougtchi
so
go
to
the
devil
my
banneret
and
may
erlik
seize
you
cleves
his
ears
ringing
with
the
sweet
confusion
of
their
girlish
laughter
rose
from
his
pillow
supporting
himself
on
one
arm
you
are
yulun
you
are
alive
and
real
he
looked
at
tressa
she
is
real
is
she
and
to
yulun
where
do
you
come
from
the
girl
replied
seriously
i
come
from
yian
she
turned
to
tressa
with
a
dazzling
smile
thou
knowest
my
heart
gold
how
it
was
i
came
tell
thy
dear
lord
in
thine
own
way
so
that
it
shall
be
simple
for
his
understanding
and
now
because
my
visit
is
ending
i
think
thy
dear
lord
should
sleep
bid
him
sleep
my
heart
gold
at
that
calm
suggestion
cleves
sat
upright
on
the
bed
or
attempted
to
but
sank
back
gently
on
his
pillow
and
met
there
a
dark
delicious
rush
of
drowsiness
he
made
an
effort
or
tried
to
the
smooth
sweet
tide
of
sleep
swept
over
him
to
the
eyelids
leaving
him
still
and
breathing
evenly
on
his
pillow
the
two
girls
leaned
over
and
looked
down
at
him
thy
dear
lord
murmured
yulun
does
he
love
thee
of
yian
no
said
tressa
under
her
breath
does
he
know
thou
art
damned
heart
of
gold
he
says
no
soul
is
ever
really
harmed
whispered
tressa
kai
has
he
never
heard
of
the
slayer
of
souls
exclaimed
yulun
incredulously
my
lord
maintains
that
neither
the
assassin
of
khorassan
nor
the
of
the
eight
towers
nor
their
dark
prince
erlik
can
have
power
over
god
to
slay
the
human
soul
tokhta
rose
of
yian
our
souls
were
slain
there
in
the
yezidee
temple
tressa
looked
down
at
cleves
my
dear
lord
says
no
she
said
under
her
breath
and
sanang
tressa
paled
his
mind
and
mine
did
battle
i
tore
my
heart
from
his
grasp
i
have
laid
it
bleeding
at
my
dear
lord
feet
let
god
judge
between
us
yulun
there
was
a
day
whispered
yulun
when
prince
sanang
went
to
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
tressa
very
pallid
looked
down
at
her
sleeping
husband
she
said
prince
sanang
came
to
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
the
snow
of
the
covered
the
young
world
the
water
was
clear
as
sunlight
and
the
lake
was
afire
with
scarlet
carp
yulun
beloved
the
nightingale
sang
all
night
long
all
night
long
then
i
saw
sanang
shining
all
gold
in
the
moonlight
may
god
remember
him
in
hell
may
god
remember
him
sanang
noïane
may
he
be
accursed
in
the
namaz
ga
may
he
be
tormented
in
jehaunum
sanang
slayer
of
souls
tressa
leaned
forward
on
the
bed
stretched
herself
out
and
laid
her
face
gently
across
her
husband
feet
touching
them
with
her
lips
then
she
straightened
herself
and
sat
up
supported
by
one
hand
and
looking
silently
down
at
the
sleeping
man
no
soul
shall
die
she
said
niaz
is
it
written
asked
yulun
surprised
my
lord
has
said
it
allahou
ekber
murmured
yulun
thy
lord
is
only
a
man
tressa
said
neither
the
tekbir
nor
the
fatha
nor
the
warning
of
khidr
nor
the
yacaz
of
the
khagan
nor
even
the
prayers
of
the
ten
imaums
are
of
any
value
to
me
unless
my
dear
lord
confirms
the
truth
of
them
with
his
own
lips
and
erlik
is
he
nothing
then
erlik
repeated
tressa
insolently
who
is
erlik
but
the
servant
of
satan
who
was
stoned
her
beautiful
angry
lips
were
suddenly
distorted
her
blue
eyes
blazed
then
she
spat
her
mouth
still
tremulous
with
hatred
she
said
in
a
voice
shaking
with
rage
yulun
beloved
listen
attentively
i
have
slain
two
of
the
slayers
of
the
eight
towers
with
god
help
i
shall
slay
them
all
all
djamouk
yaddin
arrak
all
every
one
tiyang
khan
togrul
all
shall
i
slay
even
to
the
last
one
among
them
also
i
leave
him
to
god
it
is
a
fearful
thing
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
living
god
yulun
calmly
paraphrased
the
cant
phrase
of
the
assassins
for
it
is
written
that
we
belong
to
god
and
we
return
to
him
heart
of
gold
i
shall
execute
my
duty
then
yulun
slipped
from
the
edge
of
the
bed
to
the
floor
and
stood
there
looking
oddly
at
tressa
her
eyes
as
though
choking
back
tears
or
laughter
heart
of
a
rose
she
said
in
a
suppressed
voice
my
time
is
nearly
ended
so
i
go
to
the
chamber
of
this
strange
young
man
who
holds
my
soul
like
a
pearl
afire
between
his
hands
i
think
it
it
written
that
i
shall
love
him
tressa
rose
also
and
placed
her
lips
close
to
yulun
ear
his
name
beloved
is
benton
his
room
is
on
this
floor
shall
we
the
together
yes
said
yulun
lay
your
body
down
upon
the
bed
beside
your
lord
who
sleeps
so
deeply
and
now
stretch
out
and
fold
both
hands
and
now
put
off
thy
body
like
a
silken
garment
so
and
leave
it
there
beside
thy
lord
asleep
they
stood
together
for
a
moment
shining
like
dewy
shapes
of
tall
flowers
whispering
and
laughing
together
in
the
soft
glow
of
the
night
lamp
cleves
slept
on
unstirring
there
was
the
white
and
sleeping
figure
of
his
wife
lying
on
the
bed
beside
him
but
tressa
and
yulun
were
already
melting
away
between
the
wall
and
the
confused
rosy
radiance
of
the
lamp
benton
in
night
attire
and
belted
in
fresh
from
his
bath
and
still
drying
his
curly
hair
on
a
rough
towel
wandered
back
into
his
bedroom
when
his
short
bright
hair
was
dry
he
lighted
a
cigarette
took
the
automatic
from
his
dresser
examined
the
clip
and
shoved
it
under
his
pillow
then
he
picked
up
the
little
testament
seated
himself
and
opened
it
and
read
tranquilly
while
his
cigarette
burned
when
he
was
ready
he
turned
out
the
ceiling
light
leaving
only
the
night
lamp
lighted
then
he
knelt
beside
his
bed
a
custom
surviving
the
nursery
period
and
rested
his
forehead
against
his
folded
hands
then
as
he
prayed
something
snapped
the
thread
of
prayer
as
though
somebody
had
spoken
aloud
in
the
still
room
and
like
one
who
has
been
suddenly
interrupted
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
and
upward
the
silent
shock
of
her
presence
passed
presently
he
got
up
from
his
knees
looking
at
her
all
the
while
you
are
yulun
he
said
very
calmly
the
girl
flushed
brightly
and
rested
one
hand
on
the
foot
of
the
bed
do
you
remember
in
the
moonlight
where
you
walked
along
the
hedge
of
white
hibiscus
and
oleander
that
night
you
said
to
tressa
in
the
south
yes
twice
she
said
laughing
you
stopped
to
peer
at
the
blossoms
in
the
moonlight
i
thought
i
saw
a
face
among
them
you
were
not
sure
whether
it
was
flowers
or
a
girl
face
looking
at
you
from
the
blossoming
hedge
of
white
hibiscus
said
yulun
i
know
now
he
said
in
an
odd
still
voice
unlike
his
own
yes
it
was
i
she
murmured
and
of
a
sudden
the
girl
dropped
to
her
knees
without
a
sound
and
laid
her
head
on
the
velvet
carpet
at
his
feet
so
swiftly
noiselessly
was
it
done
that
he
had
not
comprehended
had
not
moved
when
she
sat
upright
resting
on
her
knees
and
grasped
the
collar
of
her
tunic
with
both
gemmed
hands
have
pity
on
me
lord
of
my
lost
soul
she
cried
softly
benton
stooped
in
a
dazed
way
to
lift
the
girl
but
found
himself
knee
deep
in
a
snowy
drift
of
white
hibiscus
blossoms
touched
nothing
but
silken
petals
waded
in
them
as
he
stepped
forward
and
saw
her
standing
before
him
still
grasping
the
collar
of
her
golden
tunic
a
great
white
drift
of
bloom
lay
almost
waist
deep
between
them
the
fragrance
of
oleander
too
was
heavy
in
the
room
there
are
years
of
life
before
the
flaming
gates
of
jehaunum
open
and
i
am
very
young
said
yulun
wistfully
somebody
else
laughed
in
the
room
turning
his
head
he
saw
tressa
standing
by
the
empty
fireplace
what
you
see
and
hear
need
not
disturb
you
she
said
looking
at
benton
out
of
brilliant
eyes
there
is
no
god
but
god
and
his
prophet
has
been
called
by
many
names
and
to
yulun
have
i
not
told
you
that
nothing
can
harm
our
souls
yulun
expression
altered
and
she
turned
to
benton
say
it
to
me
she
pleaded
as
in
a
dream
he
heard
his
own
words
nothing
can
ever
really
harm
the
soul
yulun
hands
fell
from
her
tunic
collar
very
slowly
she
lifted
her
head
looking
at
him
out
of
lovely
proud
young
eyes
she
said
evenly
her
still
gaze
on
him
i
am
yulun
of
the
temple
my
heart
is
like
a
blazing
pearl
which
you
hold
between
your
hands
may
the
four
blessed
companions
witness
the
truth
of
what
i
say
then
a
delicate
veil
of
colour
wrapped
her
white
skin
from
throat
to
temple
she
looked
at
benton
with
sudden
and
exquisite
distress
frightened
and
ashamed
at
his
silence
in
the
intense
stillness
benton
moved
toward
her
into
his
outstretched
hands
her
two
hands
fell
but
bending
above
them
his
lips
touched
only
two
white
hibiscus
flowers
that
lay
fresh
and
dewy
in
his
palms
bewildered
he
straightened
up
and
saw
the
girl
standing
by
the
mantel
beside
tressa
who
had
caught
her
by
the
left
hand
tokhta
look
out
she
said
distinctly
suddenly
he
saw
two
men
in
the
room
close
to
him
their
broad
faces
slanting
eyes
and
sparse
beards
thrust
almost
against
his
shoulder
djamouk
cried
tressa
in
a
terrible
voice
but
quick
as
a
flash
yulun
tore
a
white
sheet
from
the
bed
flung
it
on
the
floor
and
whipping
a
tiny
jewelled
knife
from
her
sleeve
threw
it
glittering
upon
the
sheet
at
the
feet
of
the
two
men
one
shroud
for
two
souls
she
said
breathlessly
and
a
knife
like
that
to
sever
them
from
their
bodies
the
two
men
sprang
backward
as
the
sheet
touched
their
feet
and
now
they
stood
there
as
though
confounded
djamouk
kahn
of
the
fifth
tower
cried
tressa
in
a
clear
voice
you
have
put
off
your
body
like
a
threadbare
cloak
and
your
form
that
stands
there
is
only
your
mind
and
it
is
only
the
evil
will
of
yaddin
in
the
shape
of
his
body
that
confronts
us
in
this
room
of
a
man
you
have
doomed
yulun
intent
as
a
young
leopardess
on
her
prey
moved
soundlessly
toward
yaddin
tougtchi
she
said
coldly
you
did
murder
this
day
my
banneret
and
the
toug
of
djamouk
has
been
greased
now
look
out
for
yourself
do
stir
came
tressa
warning
voice
as
benton
snatched
his
pistol
from
the
pillow
do
fire
those
men
have
no
real
substance
for
god
sake
do
fire
i
tell
you
they
have
no
bodies
suddenly
something
some
force
flung
benton
on
the
bed
the
two
men
did
not
seem
to
touch
him
at
all
but
he
lay
there
struggling
crushed
held
by
something
that
was
strangling
him
through
his
swimming
eyes
he
saw
yaddin
trying
to
drive
a
long
nail
into
his
skull
with
a
hammer
felt
the
piercing
agony
of
the
first
crashing
blow
struggled
upright
drenched
in
blood
his
ears
ringing
with
the
screaming
of
yaddin
then
there
in
the
little
rococo
bedroom
of
the
began
a
strange
and
horrible
struggle
the
more
dreadful
because
the
struggle
was
not
physical
and
the
combatants
never
touched
each
other
scarcely
moved
at
all
yaddin
still
screaming
confronted
yulun
the
girl
eyes
were
ablaze
her
lips
parted
with
the
violence
of
her
breathing
and
yaddin
writhed
and
screamed
under
the
terrible
concentration
of
her
gaze
his
inferior
but
ferocious
mind
locked
with
her
mind
in
deadly
battle
the
girl
said
slowly
showing
a
glimmer
of
white
teeth
your
will
to
do
evil
to
my
young
lord
is
breaking
i
am
breaking
it
the
nail
and
hammer
were
but
symbols
it
was
your
brain
that
brooded
murder
that
willed
he
should
die
as
though
shattered
by
lightning
when
that
burst
in
his
brain
sorceress
shrieked
yaddin
what
are
you
doing
to
my
heart
where
my
body
lies
asleep
in
a
berth
on
the
montreal
express
your
heart
is
weak
yaddin
soon
the
valves
shall
fail
a
negro
porter
shall
discover
you
dead
in
your
berth
my
banneret
the
man
swarthy
face
became
livid
with
the
terrific
mental
battle
let
me
go
back
to
my
body
he
panted
what
are
you
doing
to
me
that
i
can
not
go
back
i
will
go
back
i
wish
it
i
let
us
go
back
and
rejoin
our
bodies
cried
djamouk
in
an
agonised
voice
there
are
teeth
in
my
throat
deep
in
my
throat
biting
and
tearing
out
the
cords
cancer
said
tressa
calmly
your
body
shall
die
of
it
while
your
soul
stumbles
on
through
darkness
my
tougtchi
shouted
djamouk
i
hear
my
soul
bidding
my
body
farewell
i
must
go
before
my
mind
expires
in
the
terrible
gaze
of
this
young
sorceress
he
turned
drifted
like
something
misty
to
the
solid
wall
my
soul
be
ransom
for
yours
cried
yulun
to
tressa
bar
that
path
to
life
tressa
flung
out
her
right
hand
and
with
her
forefinger
drew
a
barrier
through
space
bar
above
bar
and
benton
half
swooning
on
his
bed
saw
a
cage
of
terrible
and
living
light
penning
in
djamouk
who
beat
upon
the
incandescent
bars
and
grasped
them
and
clawed
his
way
about
squealing
like
a
tortured
rat
in
a
cage
through
the
deafening
tumult
yulun
voice
cut
like
a
sword
their
bodies
are
dying
heart
of
a
rose
listen
i
hear
their
souls
bidding
their
minds
farewell
and
after
a
dreadful
silence
the
train
speeding
north
carries
two
dead
men
god
is
god
niaz
the
bars
of
living
fire
faded
two
and
shapeless
shadows
floated
and
eddied
like
whitened
ashes
stirred
by
a
wind
on
the
hearth
then
drifted
through
the
fading
dissolving
lost
gradually
in
thin
air
tressa
leaning
back
against
the
mantel
covered
her
face
with
both
hands
yulun
crept
to
the
bed
where
benton
lay
breathing
evenly
in
deepest
sleep
with
the
sheer
sleeve
of
her
tunic
she
wiped
the
blood
from
his
face
and
at
her
touch
the
wound
in
the
temple
closed
and
the
short
bright
hair
dried
and
curled
over
a
forehead
as
clean
and
fresh
as
a
boy
then
yulun
laid
her
lips
against
his
rested
so
a
moment
seek
me
dear
lord
she
whispered
or
send
me
a
sign
and
i
shall
come
and
after
a
pause
she
said
her
lips
scarcely
stirring
love
me
my
heart
is
a
flaming
pearl
burning
between
your
hands
then
she
lifted
her
head
but
tressa
had
rejoined
her
body
where
it
lay
asleep
beside
her
deeply
sleeping
husband
so
yulun
stood
a
moment
her
eyes
remote
then
after
a
while
the
little
rococo
bedroom
in
the
was
empty
save
for
a
young
man
asleep
on
the
bed
holding
in
his
clenched
hand
a
white
hibiscus
blossom
chapter
xii
his
excellency
his
excellency
president
tintinto
chief
executive
of
one
of
the
newer
and
cruder
republics
visiting
new
york
incognito
with
his
secretaries
of
war
and
of
the
navy
had
sent
for
john
recklow
and
now
the
reception
was
in
full
operation
recklow
was
explaining
in
the
beginning
he
said
the
aim
was
to
destroy
everything
and
everybody
except
themselves
and
then
to
reorganise
for
their
own
benefit
what
was
left
of
a
wrecked
world
that
was
their
programme
quite
a
programme
interrupted
the
secretary
of
war
with
something
that
almost
resembled
a
giggle
but
his
prominent
eyes
continued
to
stare
at
recklow
untouched
by
the
mirth
which
stretched
his
large
silly
mouth
the
face
of
the
secretary
of
the
navy
resembled
the
countenance
of
a
benevolent
manatee
the
visage
of
the
president
was
a
study
in
tinted
chalks
recklow
said
to
combat
that
sort
of
bolshevism
was
a
business
that
we
of
the
united
states
secret
service
understood
or
supposed
we
understood
then
suddenly
out
of
unknown
mongolia
and
into
the
civilised
world
stepped
eight
men
yezidees
said
the
president
mechanically
your
government
has
sent
me
a
very
full
report
yezidees
of
the
sect
of
the
assassins
continued
recklow
the
most
ancient
sect
in
the
world
surviving
from
ancient
times
the
sorcerers
of
asia
and
as
it
was
in
ancient
times
so
it
is
now
the
yezidees
are
devil
worshipers
their
god
is
satan
prophet
is
erlik
prince
of
darkness
regent
on
earth
is
the
old
man
of
mount
alamout
and
to
this
ancient
and
sinister
title
a
yezidee
sorcerer
called
prince
sanang
or
sanang
noïane
has
succeeded
his
murderous
deputies
were
the
eight
khans
of
the
eight
towers
four
of
these
assassins
are
dead
gutchlug
yarghouz
djamouk
the
fox
and
one
is
in
prison
charged
with
murder
albert
feke
four
of
the
sorcerers
remain
alive
tiyang
khan
togrul
arrak
called
the
squirrel
and
the
old
man
of
the
mountain
himself
prince
of
the
yezidees
recklow
paused
the
of
the
war
secretary
were
upon
him
the
benevolent
manatee
gazed
mildly
at
him
the
countenance
of
the
president
seemed
more
like
a
rocky
mountain
goat
than
ever
chiselled
out
of
a
block
of
tinted
chalk
recklow
said
to
the
menace
of
bolshevism
which
endangers
this
republic
and
yours
has
been
added
a
more
terrible
threat
the
threat
of
powerful
and
evil
minds
made
formidable
by
psychic
knowledge
for
these
yezidee
sorcerers
are
determined
to
conquer
seize
and
subdue
the
minds
of
mankind
they
are
here
for
that
frightful
purpose
powerfully
terrifically
equipped
to
surprise
and
capture
the
unarmed
minds
of
our
people
enslave
their
very
thoughts
and
use
them
to
their
own
purposes
these
sorcerers
of
the
yezidees
assumed
control
of
the
bolsheviki
who
were
merely
envious
and
ferocious
bandits
but
whose
crippled
minds
are
now
utterly
enslaved
by
these
assassins
from
asia
and
this
is
what
the
united
states
secret
service
has
to
combat
and
its
weapons
are
not
warrants
not
pistols
for
in
this
awful
battle
between
decency
and
evil
it
is
mind
against
mind
in
an
occult
death
grapple
and
our
only
weapon
against
these
minds
made
powerful
by
psychic
knowledge
and
made
terrible
by
an
esoteric
ability
akin
to
what
is
called
black
magic
our
only
weapon
is
the
mind
of
a
young
girl
i
understand
said
the
president
that
she
became
an
adept
in
occult
practices
while
imprisoned
in
the
yezidee
temple
of
erlik
at
yian
recklow
looked
into
the
president
face
which
had
grown
very
pale
yes
sir
he
said
god
alone
knows
what
this
child
learned
in
the
yezidee
temple
all
i
know
is
that
with
this
knowledge
she
has
met
the
yezidees
in
a
battle
of
minds
has
halted
them
confounded
them
fought
them
with
their
own
occult
knowledge
and
has
slain
four
of
them
the
intense
silence
was
broken
by
the
frivolous
titter
of
the
secretary
of
war
of
course
i
do
believe
any
of
this
supernatural
stuff
he
said
with
the
split
grin
which
did
not
modify
his
protruding
stare
this
girl
is
merely
a
clever
detective
that
is
the
gist
of
the
matter
and
i
believe
anything
else
perhaps
sir
you
will
believe
this
then
said
john
recklow
quietly
i
cut
it
from
the
this
morning
and
he
handed
the
clipping

the

is
to

the
effects
of
this

may
already
be
traced
in
recent
events
in
egypt
india

afghanistan
for
the

through
the

into

during

at
the
instigation
of
the
german
general
staff
at
a
constituent
assembly
of
the
league
which
took

there
were
present
besides
young
turks
egyptians
and
hindus
delegates
representing
persia
afghanistan
algeria
morocco
and

the
league
is
of
mongolian
origin
its
leading

is
a
certain

whom

that
the
union
between

the
most
striking
and
dangerous
feature
of
the
movement
is
chiefly
due
considerable
funds
are
at
the
disposal
of
the
league
these
are
partly
supplied
from
germany
besides
enjoying
the
support
of
the
germans
the
league
is
also
in
close
touch
with
lenine
who
very
soon
after
his
advent
to
power
organised
an
oriental
department
in
moscow
the
alliance
between
the
league
and
the
russian
bolsheviki
was
brought
about
by
the
notorious
german
socialist
agent
parvus
who
is
now
in
switzerland
many
weeks
ago
he
conferred
with
the
soviet
rulers
in
moscow
whence
he
went
to
afghanistan
hoping
to
reorganise
the
new
amir
army
and
establish
lines
of
communication
for
propaganda
in
india
evidence
exists
that
the
recent
insurrection
in
egypt
the
sudden
attack
of
the
afghans
and
the
rising
in
india
remarkable
for
between
moslems
and
hindus
were
connected
with
the
activities
of
the
league
the
secretary
looked
up
after
he
finished
the
reading
i
do
see
anything
about
black
magic
in
this
he
remarked
flippantly
recklow
features
became
very
grave
i
think
he
said
that
everybody
myself
included
and
with
all
respect
even
yourself
sir
and
your
honourable
colleague
and
perhaps
even
his
excellency
your
president
should
be
on
perpetual
guard
over
their
minds
and
the
thoughts
that
range
there
lest
surreptitiously
stealthily
some
taint
of
yezidee
infection
lodge
there
and
take
root
and
spread
perhaps
throughout
your
new
republic
the
secretary
of
war
grinned
they
say
i
something
of
a
socialist
already
he
chuckled
do
you
think
your
magic
yezidees
are
responsible
the
president
troubled
and
pallid
gazed
steadily
at
recklow
mine
is
a
mind
he
remarked
as
though
to
himself
recklow
said
nothing
it
is
one
kind
of
mind
after
all
however
roads
are
now
obsolete
a
mind
repeated
the
president
and
i
should
not
like
anything
to
happen
to
the
switch
it
would
mean
ditching
or
a
rusty
siding
at
best
please
do
all
that
is
possible
to
get
those
four
yezidees
mr
recklow
recklow
said
calmly
our
only
hope
is
in
this
young
girl
tressa
norne
who
is
now
mrs
cleves
my
conscience
piped
the
secretary
of
the
navy
what
would
happen
to
us
if
these
yezidees
should
murder
her
god
knows
replied
john
recklow
unsmiling
why
not
put
her
aboard
our
new
dreadnought
suggested
the
secretary
and
keep
her
cruising
until
you
united
states
secret
service
fellows
get
the
rest
of
these
infernal
yezidees
and
clap
into
jail
we
can
do
nothing
without
her
said
recklow
sombrely
there
was
a
painful
silence
the
president
joined
his
finger
tips
and
stared
palely
into
space
may
i
not
say
he
suggested
that
i
think
it
a
vital
necessity
that
these
yezidees
be
caught
and
destroyed
before
they
do
any
damage
to
the
minds
of
myself
and
my
cabinet
god
grant
it
sir
said
recklow
grimly
mine
murmured
the
president
is
a
mind
i
should
be
very
much
annoyed
if
anybody
tampered
with
the
rails
very
much
annoyed
indeed
mr
recklow
they
must
murder
that
girl
said
the
secretary
of
the
navy
do
you
need
any
marines
recklow
why
not
ask
your
government
for
a
few
recklow
rose
president
he
said
i
shall
not
deny
that
my
government
is
very
deeply
disturbed
by
this
situation
in
the
beginning
these
eight
assassins
and
sanang
came
here
for
the
purpose
of
attacking
overpowering
and
enslaving
the
minds
of
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
south
american
republics
but
now
after
four
of
their
infamous
colleagues
have
been
destroyed
the
ferocious
survivors
thoroughly
alarmed
have
turned
their
every
energy
toward
accomplishing
the
death
of
cleves
why
sir
scarcely
a
day
passes
but
that
some
attempt
upon
her
life
is
made
by
these
yezidees
scarcely
a
day
passes
that
this
young
girl
is
not
suddenly
summoned
to
defend
her
mind
as
well
as
her
body
against
the
occult
attacks
of
these
mongol
sorcerers
yes
sir
sorcerers
repeated
recklow
his
calm
voice
deep
with
controlled
passion
whatever
your
honourable
secretary
of
war
may
think
about
it
his
cold
grey
eyes
measured
the
president
as
he
stood
there
president
i
am
at
my
wits
end
to
protect
her
from
assassination
her
husband
is
always
with
her
victor
cleves
sir
of
our
secret
service
but
wherever
he
takes
her
these
devils
follow
and
send
their
emissaries
to
watch
her
to
follow
to
attempt
her
mental
destruction
or
her
physical
death
there
is
no
end
to
their
stealthy
cunning
to
their
devilish
devices
to
their
hellish
ingenuity
and
all
we
can
do
is
to
guard
her
person
from
the
approach
of
strangers
and
stand
ready
physically
to
aid
her
she
is
our
only
barrier
only
defence
between
civilisation
and
horrors
worse
than
bolshevism
i
believe
president
that
civilisation
in
north
and
south
america
in
your
own
republic
as
well
as
in
ours
depends
literally
upon
the
safety
of
tressa
cleves
for
if
the
yezidees
kill
her
then
i
do
not
see
what
is
to
save
civilisation
from
utter
disintegration
and
total
destruction
there
was
a
silence
recklow
was
not
certain
that
the
president
had
been
listening
his
excellency
sat
with
finger
tips
joined
gazing
pallidly
into
space
and
recklow
heard
him
murmuring
under
his
breath
and
all
to
himself
as
though
to
fix
the
deathless
thought
forever
in
his
brain
may
i
not
say
that
mine
is
a
mind

chapter
xiii
june
sunshine
poured
through
the
window
of
his
bedroom
in
the
ritz
and
cleves
had
just
finished
dressing
when
he
heard
his
wife
voice
in
the
adjoining
he
had
not
supposed
that
tressa
was
awake
he
hastened
to
tie
his
tie
and
pull
on
a
smoking
jacket
listening
all
the
while
to
his
modulated
but
gay
young
voice
then
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
and
found
his
wife
entirely
alone
she
looked
up
at
him
her
lips
still
parted
as
though
checked
in
what
she
had
been
saying
the
smile
still
visible
in
her
blue
eyes
who
on
earth
are
you
talking
to
he
asked
his
bewildered
glance
sweeping
the
sunny
room
again
she
did
not
reply
her
smile
faded
as
a
spot
of
sunlight
wanes
veiled
by
a
cloud
yet
a
glimmer
of
it
remained
in
her
gaze
as
he
came
over
to
her
i
thought
they
brought
our
breakfast
he
said
hearing
your
voice
did
you
sleep
well
yes
victor
he
seated
himself
and
his
perplexed
scrutiny
included
her
frail
morning
robe
of
china
silk
her
lovely
bare
arms
and
her
splendid
hair
twisted
up
and
pegged
down
with
a
jade
dagger
around
her
bare
throat
and
shoulders
too
was
a
magnificent
necklace
of
imperial
jade
which
he
had
never
before
seen
and
on
one
slim
white
finger
a
superb
jade
ring
by
jove
he
said
you
very
exotic
this
morning
tressa
i
never
before
saw
that
negligee
effect
the
girl
laughed
glanced
at
her
ring
lifted
a
frail
silken
fold
and
examined
the
amazing
embroidery
i
wore
it
at
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
she
said
the
name
of
that
place
always
chilled
him
he
had
begun
to
hate
it
perhaps
because
of
all
that
he
did
not
know
about
it
about
his
strange
girlhood
about
yian
and
the
devil
temple
there
and
about
sanang
he
said
coldly
but
politely
that
the
robe
was
unusual
and
the
jade
very
wonderful
the
alteration
in
his
voice
and
expression
did
not
escape
her
it
meant
merely
masculine
jealousy
but
tressa
never
dreamed
he
cared
in
that
way
breakfast
was
brought
served
and
presently
these
two
young
people
were
busy
with
their
melons
coffee
and
toast
in
the
sunny
room
high
above
the
softened
racket
of
traffic
echoing
through
avenue
and
street
below
recklow
telephoned
me
this
morning
he
remarked
she
looked
up
her
face
serious
recklow
says
that
yezidee
mischief
is
taking
visible
shape
the
socialist
party
is
going
to
be
split
into
bits
and
a
new
party
impudently
and
publicly
announcing
itself
as
the
communist
party
of
america
is
being
organised
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
as
shameless
as
outrageous
in
this
republic
she
said
very
quietly
sanang
has
taken
prisoner
the
minds
of
these
wretched
people
he
and
his
remaining
yezidees
are
giving
battle
to
the
unarmed
minds
of
our
american
people
gutchlug
is
dead
said
cleves
and
yarghouz
and
djamouk
and
yaddin
but
tiyang
khan
is
alive
and
togrul
and
that
cunning
demon
arrak
called
the
squirrel
she
said
she
bent
her
head
considering
the
jade
ring
on
her
and
prince
sanang
she
added
in
a
low
voice
why
did
you
let
me
shoot
him
when
i
had
the
chance
said
cleves
harshly
so
abrupt
was
his
question
so
rough
his
sudden
manner
that
the
girl
looked
up
in
dismayed
surprise
then
a
deep
colour
stained
her
face
once
she
said
prince
sanang
held
my
heart
prisoner
as
erlik
held
my
soul
i
told
you
that
is
that
the
reason
you
gave
the
fellow
a
chance
yes
oh
and
possibly
you
gave
sanang
a
chance
because
he
still
holds
your
affections
she
said
crimson
with
the
pain
of
the
accusation
i
tore
my
heart
out
of
his
keeping
i
told
you
that
and
believing
trying
to
believe
what
you
say
to
me
i
have
tried
to
tear
my
soul
out
of
the
claws
of
erlik
why
are
you
angry
i
do
know
i
not
angry
the
whole
horrible
situation
is
breaking
my
nerve
i
guess
with
whom
were
you
talking
before
i
came
in
after
a
silence
the
girl
smile
glimmered
i
afraid
you
wo
like
it
if
i
tell
you
why
not
you
such
things
perplex
and
worry
you
i
am
afraid
you
wo
like
me
any
the
better
if
i
tell
you
who
it
was
i
had
been
talking
with
his
intent
gaze
never
left
her
i
want
you
to
tell
me
he
repeated
i
i
was
talking
with
she
faltered
with
whom
with
we
called
her
sansa
who
the
dickens
is
sansa
we
were
three
comrades
at
the
temple
she
said
timidly
yulun
sansa
and
myself
we
loved
each
other
we
always
went
to
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
together
for
protection
go
on
sansa
was
a
girl
of
the
aroulads
born
at
buldak
as
was
temujin
the
night
she
was
born
three
made
circles
around
her
yaïlak
the
baroulass
horsemen
saw
this
and
prayed
loudly
in
their
saddles
then
they
galloped
to
yian
and
came
crawling
on
their
bellies
to
sanang
noïane
with
the
news
of
the
miracle
and
sanang
came
with
a
thousand
riders
in
leather
armour
and
is
this
child
name
he
shouted
riding
into
the
yaïlak
with
his
black
banners
flapping
around
him
like
devil
wings
a
poor
manggoud
came
out
of
the
tent
of
skins
carrying
the
new
born
infant
and
touched
his
head
to
sanang
stirrup
babe
is
called
tchagane
he
said
trembling
all
over
cries
sanang
is
called
sansa
give
her
to
me
and
may
erlik
seize
you
and
he
took
the
baby
on
his
saddle
in
front
of
him
and
struck
his
spurs
deep
and
so
came
sansa
to
yian
under
a
roaring
rustle
of
black
silk
banners
it
is
so
written
in
the
book
of
iron
allahou
ekber
cleves
had
leaned
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
forehead
rested
in
his
palm
perhaps
he
was
striving
in
a
bewildered
way
to
reconcile
such
occult
and
amazing
things
with
the
year
with
the
commonplace
and
noisy
city
of
new
york
with
this
pretty
modern
sunlit
in
the
on
madison
avenue
with
this
girl
in
her
morning
negligee
opposite
her
coffee
and
melon
fragrant
at
her
elbow
her
wonderful
blue
eyes
resting
on
him
sansa
he
repeated
slowly
as
though
striving
to
grasp
even
a
single
word
from
the
confusion
of
names
and
phrases
that
were
sounding
still
in
his
ears
like
the
vibration
of
distant
and
unfamiliar
seas
is
this
the
girl
you
were
talking
with
just
now
in
in
room
he
added
striving
to
understand
yes
she
was
here
of
course
her
body
was
not
oh
tressa
said
in
her
sweet
humorous
way
you
must
try
to
accustom
yourself
to
such
things
victor
you
know
that
yulun
talks
to
me
i
wanted
to
talk
to
sansa
the
longing
awakened
me
so
made
the
and
she
came
i
mean
the
part
of
her
which
is
not
her
body
yes
she
came
we
talked
very
happily
while
i
was
bathing
and
dressing
then
we
came
in
here
she
is
such
a
darling
where
is
she
in
yian
feeding
her
and
making
a
garden
you
see
sansa
is
quite
wealthy
now
because
when
the
japanese
came
she
filled
a
bullock
cart
with
great
lumps
of
spongy
gold
from
the
temple
and
filled
another
cart
with
and
took
the
hezar
of
baroulass
horsemen
on
guard
at
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
and
with
this
keutch
riding
a
soubz
horse
and
dressed
like
an
urieng
lancer
my
pretty
little
comrade
tchagane
who
is
called
sansa
marched
north
preceded
by
two
and
a
toug
with
two
tails
tressa
clear
laughter
checked
her
she
clapped
her
hands
breathless
with
mirth
at
the
picture
she
evoked
kai
she
laughed
what
adorable
impudence
has
sansa
neither
tchortcha
nor
khiounnou
dared
ask
her
who
were
her
seven
ancestors
no
and
when
her
caravan
came
to
the
lovely
yliang
river
my
darling
sansa
rode
out
and
grasped
the
lance
from
her
tougtchi
and
drove
the
point
deep
into
the
fertile
soil
crying
in
a
clear
voice
place
for
tchagane
and
her
people
make
room
for
the
toug
then
her
manggoud
who
carried
the
spare
steel
tip
for
her
lance
got
out
of
his
saddle
and
gathering
a
handful
of
mulberry
leaves
rubbed
the
shaft
of
the
lance
till
it
was
all
pale
green
iaglachakho
cries
my
adorable
sansa
me
here
my
urdu
my
mocalla
and
upon
it
pitch
my
tent
of
skins
footnote

an
imperial
encampment

mocalla
a
platform
used
as
a
moslem
pulpit
again
tressa
laughter
checked
her
and
she
strove
to
control
it
with
the
jade
ring
pressed
to
her
lips
oh
victor
she
added
in
a
stifled
voice
looking
at
him
out
of
eyes
full
of
mischief
you
do
realise
how
funny
it
was
sansa
and
her
toug
and
her
urdu
oh
allah
the
bones
of
tchinguiz
must
have
rattled
in
his
tomb
her
infectious
laughter
evoked
a
responsive
but
perplexed
smile
from
cleves
but
it
was
the
smile
of
a
bewildered
man
who
has
comprehended
very
little
of
an
involved
jest
and
he
looked
around
at
the
modern
room
as
though
to
find
his
bearings
suddenly
tressa
leaned
forward
swiftly
and
laid
one
hand
on
his
you
do
think
all
this
is
very
funny
you
do
like
it
she
said
in
soft
concern
it
is
that
tressa
but
this
is
new
york
city
in
the
year
and
i
ca
i
absolutely
can
not
get
into
touch
hook
up
mentally
with
such
things
with
the
unreal
oriental
life
that
is
so
familiar
to
you
she
nodded
sympathetically
i
know
you
feel
like
a
mergued
pagan
from
lake
baïkal
when
all
the
lamps
are
lighted
in
the
mosque
like
a
camel
driver
with
his
jade
and
gold
when
he
enters
yarkand
at
sunrise
probably
i
feel
like
that
said
cleves
laughing
outright
i
take
your
word
dear
anyway
but
he
took
more
he
picked
up
her
soft
hand
where
it
still
rested
on
his
pressed
it
and
instantly
reddened
because
he
had
done
it
and
tressa
bright
flush
responded
so
quickly
that
neither
of
them
understood
and
both
misunderstood
the
girl
rose
with
heightened
colour
not
knowing
why
she
stood
up
or
what
she
meant
to
do
and
cleves
misinterpreting
her
emotion
as
a
silent
rebuke
to
the
invasion
of
that
convention
tacitly
accepted
between
them
stood
up
too
and
began
to
speak
carelessly
of
commonplace
things
she
made
the
effort
to
reply
scarcely
knowing
what
she
was
saying
so
violently
had
his
caress
disturbed
her
heart
and
she
was
still
speaking
when
their
telephone
rang
cleves
went
listened
then
still
listening
summoned
tressa
to
his
side
with
a
gesture
it
selden
he
said
in
a
low
voice
he
says
he
has
the
yezidee
arrak
under
observation
and
that
he
needs
you
desperately
will
you
help
us
i
go
of
course
she
replied
turning
quite
pale
cleves
nodded
still
listening
after
a
while
all
right
we
be
there
he
said
sharply
and
hung
up
then
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
wife
i
wish
to
god
he
muttered
that
this
business
were
ended
i
i
bear
to
have
you
go
i
am
not
afraid
where
is
it
i
never
heard
of
the
place
before
we
to
meet
selden
at
acre
where
is
it
victor
i
do
know
selden
says
there
are
no
roads
not
even
a
spotted
trail
it
a
wilderness
left
practically
blank
by
the
geological
survey
only
the
contours
are
marked
and
selden
tells
me
that
the
altitudes
are
erroneous
and
the
unnamed
lakes
and
water
courses
are
all
wrong
he
says
it
is
his
absolute
conviction
that
the
geological
survey
never
penetrated
this
wilderness
at
all
but
merely
skirted
it
and
guessed
at
what
lay
inside
because
the
map
he
has
from
washington
is
utterly
misleading
and
the
entire
region
is
left
blank
except
for
a
few
vague
blue
lines
and
spots
indicating
water
and
a
few
heights
marked
he
turned
and
began
to
pace
the
frowning
perplexed
undecided
selden
tells
me
he
said
that
the
yezidee
arrak
is
in
there
and
very
busy
doing
something
or
other
he
says
that
he
can
do
nothing
without
you
and
will
explain
why
when
we
meet
him
yes
victor
cleves
turned
on
his
heel
and
came
over
to
where
his
wife
stood
beside
the
sunny
window
i
hate
to
ask
you
to
go
i
know
that
was
the
understanding
but
this
incessant
danger
your
constant
peril
that
does
not
count
when
i
think
of
my
country
peril
she
said
in
a
quiet
voice
when
are
we
to
start
and
what
shall
i
pack
in
my
trunk
dear
child
he
said
with
a
brusque
laugh
it
a
wilderness
and
we
carry
what
we
need
on
our
backs
selden
meets
us
at
a
place
called
glenwild
on
the
edge
of
this
wilderness
and
we
follow
him
in
on
our
two
legs
he
glanced
across
at
the
mantel
clock
if
you
dress
he
said
nervously
we
go
to
some
shop
that
outfits
sportsmen
for
the
north
because
if
we
can
we
ought
to
leave
on
the
one
train
she
smiled
came
up
to
him
do
worry
about
me
she
said
because
i
also
am
nervous
and
tired
and
i
mean
to
make
an
end
of
every
yezidee
remaining
in
america
sanang
too
they
both
flushed
deeply
she
said
in
a
steady
voice
between
god
and
erlik
there
is
a
black
gulf
where
a
million
million
stars
hang
lighting
a
million
million
other
worlds
prince
sanang
star
glimmers
there
it
is
a
sun
called
yramid
and
it
lights
the
planet
let
him
reign
there
between
god
and
erlik
you
will
slay
this
man
god
forbid
she
said
shuddering
but
i
shall
send
him
to
his
own
star
let
my
soul
be
ransom
for
his
and
may
allah
judge
between
us
between
this
man
and
me
then
in
the
still
sunny
room
the
girl
turned
to
face
the
east
and
her
husband
saw
her
lips
move
as
though
speaking
but
heard
no
sound
what
on
earth
are
you
saying
there
all
to
yourself
he
demanded
at
last
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
across
her
left
shoulder
i
asked
sansa
to
help
me
and
she
says
she
will
cleves
nodded
in
a
dazed
way
then
he
opened
a
window
and
leaned
there
in
the
sunshine
looking
down
into
madison
avenue
and
the
roar
of
traffic
seemed
to
soothe
his
nerves
but
good
heavens
he
thought
do
such
things
really
go
on
in
new
york
in
is
the
entire
world
becoming
a
little
crazy
am
i
really
in
my
right
mind
when
i
believe
that
the
girl
i
married
is
talking
without
wireless
to
another
girl
in
china
he
leaned
there
heavily
gazing
down
into
the
street
with
sombre
eyes
what
a
ghastly
thing
these
yezidees
are
trying
to
do
to
the
world
these
assassins
of
men
minds
he
thought
turning
away
toward
the
door
of
his
bedroom
as
he
crossed
the
threshold
he
stumbled
and
looking
down
saw
that
he
had
tripped
over
a
white
sheet
lying
there
for
a
moment
he
thought
it
was
a
sheet
from
his
own
bed
and
he
started
to
pick
it
up
then
he
saw
the
naked
blade
of
a
knife
at
his
feet
with
an
uncontrollable
shudder
he
stepped
out
of
the
shroud
and
stood
staring
at
the
knife
as
though
it
were
a
snake
it
had
a
curved
blade
and
a
bone
hilt
coarsely
inlaid
with
arabic
characters
in
brass
the
shroud
was
a
threadbare
affair
perhaps
a
from
some
cheap
lodging
house
but
its
significance
was
so
repulsive
that
he
hesitated
to
touch
it
however
he
was
ashamed
to
have
it
discovered
in
his
room
he
picked
up
the
knife
and
kicked
the
shroud
out
into
the
corridor
where
they
could
guess
if
they
liked
how
such
a
rag
got
into
the
then
he
searched
his
bedroom
and
of
course
discovered
nobody
hiding
but
chills
crawled
on
his
spine
while
he
was
about
it
and
he
shivered
still
as
he
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
examining
the
knife
and
testing
edge
and
point
then
close
to
his
ear
a
low
voice
whispered
be
careful
my
lord
the
yezidee
knife
is
poisoned
but
it
is
written
that
a
poisoned
heart
is
more
dangerous
still
he
had
turned
like
a
flash
and
he
saw
between
him
and
the
door
a
very
young
girl
with
slightly
slanting
eyes
and
rose
and
ivory
features
as
perfect
as
though
moulded
out
of
tinted
bisque
she
wore
a
loose
blue
linen
robe
belted
in
short
at
the
elbows
and
skirt
showing
two
arms
and
two
bare
feet
in
straw
sandals
in
one
hand
she
had
a
spray
of
purple
mulberries
and
she
looked
coolly
at
cleves
and
ate
a
berry
or
two
give
me
the
knife
she
said
calmly
he
handed
it
to
her
she
wiped
it
with
a
mulberry
leaf
and
slipped
it
through
her
girdle
i
am
sansa
she
said
with
a
friendly
glance
at
him
busy
with
her
fruit
cleves
strove
to
speak
naturally
but
his
voice
trembled
is
it
you
i
mean
your
real
self
your
own
body
it
my
real
self
yes
but
my
body
is
asleep
in
my
mulberry
grove
in
in
china
yes
she
said
calmly
detaching
another
mulberry
and
eating
it
a
few
fresh
leaves
fell
on
the
centre
table
sansa
chose
another
berry
you
know
she
said
that
i
came
to
tressa
this
morning
to
my
little
heart
of
fire
i
came
when
she
called
me
and
i
was
quite
sleepy
too
but
i
heard
her
though
there
was
a
night
wind
in
the
mulberry
trees
and
the
river
made
a
silvery
roaring
noise
in
the
dark
and
now
i
must
go
but
i
shall
come
again
very
soon
she
smiled
shyly
and
held
out
her
lovely
little
hand
as
tressa
tells
me
is
your
custom
in
america
she
said
i
offer
you
a
he
took
her
hand
and
found
it
a
warm
smooth
thing
of
life
and
pulse
why
he
stammered
in
his
astonishment
you
real
you
are
not
a
ghost
yes
i
am
real
she
answered
surprised
but
i
not
in
my
body
if
you
mean
that
then
she
laughed
and
withdrew
her
hand
and
going
made
him
a
friendly
gesture
cherish
my
lord
my
darling
heart
of
fire
serpents
twist
and
twine
so
do
rose
vines
may
their
petals
make
your
path
of
velvet
and
sweet
scented
may
everything
that
is
round
be
a
pomegranate
for
you
two
to
share
may
everything
that
sways
be
lilies
bordering
a
path
wide
enough
for
two
in
the
name
of
the
most
merciful
god
may
the
only
cry
you
hear
be
the
first
sweet
wail
of
your
and
when
the
tenth
shall
be
born
may
you
and
heart
of
fire
bewail
your
fate
because
both
of
you
desire
more
children
she
was
laughing
when
she
disappeared
cleves
thought
she
was
still
there
so
radiant
the
sunshine
so
sweet
the
scent
in
the
room
but
the
golden
shadow
by
the
door
was
empty
of
her
if
she
had
slipped
through
the
doorway
he
had
not
noticed
her
departure
yet
she
was
no
longer
there
and
when
he
understood
he
turned
back
into
the
empty
room
quivering
all
over
suddenly
a
terrible
need
of
tressa
assailed
him
an
imperative
necessity
to
speak
to
her
hear
her
voice
tressa
he
called
and
rested
his
hand
on
the
centre
table
feeling
weak
and
shaken
to
the
knees
then
he
looked
down
and
saw
the
mulberry
leaves
lying
scattered
there
tender
and
green
and
still
dewy
with
the
dew
of
china
oh
my
god
he
whispered
such
things
it
is
my
mind
that
has
gone
wrong
there
such
things
the
conviction
swept
him
like
a
tide
till
his
senses
swam
as
though
peering
through
a
mist
of
gold
he
saw
his
wife
enter
and
come
to
him
felt
her
arm
about
him
sustaining
him
where
he
swayed
slightly
with
one
hand
on
the
table
among
the
mulberry
leaves
ah
murmured
tressa
noticing
the
green
leaves
she
ought
to
have
done
that
that
was
thoughtless
of
her
to
show
herself
to
you
cleves
looked
at
her
in
a
dazed
way
the
body
is
nothing
he
muttered
the
rest
only
is
real
that
is
the
truth
is
it
yes
i
seem
to
be
beginning
to
believe
it
sansa
said
things
i
shall
try
to
tell
you
some
day
dear
i
so
glad
to
hear
your
voice
are
you
she
murmured
and
so
glad
to
feel
your
touch
i
found
a
shroud
on
my
threshold
and
a
knife
the
yezidees
are
becoming
mountebanks
where
is
the
knife
she
asked
scornfully
sansa
said
it
was
poisoned
she
took
it
she
she
said
that
a
poisoned
heart
is
more
dangerous
still
then
tressa
threw
up
her
head
and
called
softly
into
space
sansa
little
what
are
these
mischievous
things
you
have
told
to
my
lord
she
stood
silent
listening
and
in
the
answer
which
he
could
not
hear
there
seemed
to
be
something
that
set
his
young
wife
cheeks
aflame
sansa
little
devil
she
cried
exasperated
may
erlik
send
his
imps
to
pinch
you
if
you
have
said
to
my
lord
these
shameful
things
it
was
impudent
it
was
mischievous
you
cover
me
with
shame
and
confusion
and
i
am
humbled
in
the
dust
of
my
lord
feet
cleves
looked
at
her
but
she
could
not
sustain
his
gaze
did
sansa
say
to
you
what
she
said
to
me
he
demanded
unsteadily
yes
i
ask
your
pardon
and
i
had
already
her
you
did
not
did
not
were
not
in
love
with
me
i
ask
your
pardon
ask
more
ask
your
heart
whether
it
would
care
to
hear
that
i
am
in
love
and
with
whom
ask
your
heart
if
it
could
ever
care
to
listen
to
what
my
heart
could
say
to
it
i
ask
my
heart
she
faltered
i
think
i
had
better
finish
dressing
she
lifted
her
eyes
gave
him
a
breathless
smile
as
he
caught
her
hand
and
kissed
it
it
it
would
be
very
wonderful
she
stammered
if
our
necessity
should
our
choice
but
that
speech
seemed
to
scare
her
and
she
fled
leaving
her
husband
standing
tense
and
upright
in
the
middle
of
the
room
their
train
on
the
new
york
central
railroad
left
the
grand
central
terminal
at
one
in
the
afternoon
cleves
had
made
his
arrangements
by
wire
they
travelled
lightly
carrying
except
for
the
clothing
they
wore
only
camping
equipment
for
two
it
was
raining
in
the
hudson
valley
they
rushed
through
the
outlying
towns
and
in
a
summer
downpour
at
hudson
the
rain
slackened
a
golden
mist
enveloped
albany
through
which
the
beautiful
tower
and
façades
along
the
river
loomed
masking
the
huge
and
clumsy
capitol
and
the
spires
beyond
at
schenectady
rifts
overhead
revealed
glimpses
of
blue
at
amsterdam
where
they
descended
from
the
train
the
flag
on
the
arsenal
across
the
mohawk
flickered
brilliantly
in
the
sunny
wind
by
telegraphic
arrangement
behind
the
station
waited
a
touring
car
driven
by
a
trooper
of
state
constabulary
who
with
his
comrade
saluted
smartly
as
cleves
and
tressa
came
up
there
was
a
brief
conversation
their
camping
outfit
was
stowed
aboard
tressa
sprang
into
the
tonneau
followed
by
cleves
and
the
car
started
swiftly
up
the
inclined
roadway
turned
to
the
right
across
the
railroad
bridge
across
the
trolley
tracks
and
straight
on
up
the
steep
hill
paved
with
blocks
of
granite
on
the
level
road
which
traversed
the
ridge
at
last
they
speeded
up
whizzed
past
the
great
hedged
farm
where
racing
horses
are
bred
rushing
through
the
afternoon
sunshine
through
the
scotch
settlements
which
once
were
outposts
of
the
old
new
york
frontier
nine
miles
out
the
macadam
road
ended
they
veered
to
the
left
over
a
dirt
road
through
two
hamlets
then
turned
to
the
right
the
landscape
became
rougher
to
their
left
lay
the
long
low
maxon
hills
behind
them
the
mayfield
range
stretched
northward
into
the
open
jaws
of
the
adirondacks
all
around
them
were
woods
now
once
a
gate
house
appeared
ahead
and
beyond
it
they
crossed
four
bridges
over
a
foaming
tumbling
creek
where
cleves
caught
glimpses
of
shadowy
forms
in
pools
big
yellow
trout
that
sank
unhurriedly
out
of
sight
among
huge
submerged
boulders
wet
with
spray
the
state
trooper
beside
the
chauffeur
turned
to
cleves
his
purple
tie
whipping
in
the
wind
yonder
is
glenwild
sir
he
said
it
was
a
single
house
on
the
flank
of
a
heavily
forested
hill
deep
below
to
the
left
the
creek
leaped
two
cataracts
and
went
flashing
out
through
a
belt
of
cleared
territory
ablaze
with
late
sunshine
the
car
swung
into
the
past
the
barn
on
the
right
and
continued
on
up
a
very
rough
trail
this
is
the
road
to
the
ireland
vlaie
said
the
trooper
it
is
possible
for
cars
for
another
mile
only
splendid
spruce
pine
oak
maple
and
hemlock
fringed
the
swampy
uneven
trail
which
was
no
more
than
a
wide
rough
vista
cut
through
the
forest
and
as
the
trooper
had
said
a
little
more
than
a
mile
farther
the
trail
became
a
tangle
of
bushes
and
swale
the
car
slowed
down
and
stopped
and
a
man
rose
from
where
he
was
seated
on
a
mossy
log
and
came
forward
his
rifle
balanced
across
the
hollow
of
his
left
arm
the
man
was
alek
selden
it
was
long
after
dark
and
they
were
still
travelling
through
pathless
woods
by
the
aid
of
their
electric
torches
there
was
little
underbrush
the
forest
of
spruce
and
hemlock
was
first
growth
cleves
shined
the
trees
but
could
discover
no
blazing
no
trodden
path
in
explanation
selden
said
briefly
that
he
had
hunted
the
territory
for
years
but
i
do
begin
to
know
it
he
added
there
are
vast
and
ugly
regions
of
bog
and
swale
where
a
sea
of
alders
stretches
to
the
horizon
there
are
desolate
wastes
of
and
under
leprous
tangles
of
grey
birches
where
stealthy
little
brooks
darkle
deep
under
matted
débris
only
wild
things
can
travel
such
country
then
there
are
strange
creeks
in
the
perpetual
shadows
of
tamarack
woods
where
many
a
man
has
gone
in
never
to
come
out
why
asked
tressa
under
the
tender
carpet
of
green
cresses
are
shining
black
bogs
set
with
tussock
and
under
the
bog
stretches
quicksand
and
death
do
you
know
these
places
asked
cleves
no
cleves
stepped
forward
to
tressa
side
keep
flashing
the
ground
he
said
harshly
i
do
want
you
to
step
into
some
i
sorry
i
brought
you
anyway
but
i
had
to
come
she
said
in
a
low
voice
like
the
two
men
she
wore
a
grey
flannel
shirt
knickers
and
spiral
puttees
they
however
carried
rifles
as
well
as
packs
and
the
girl
pack
was
lighter
they
had
halted
by
a
swift
icy
rivulet
to
eat
without
building
a
fire
after
that
they
crossed
the
ireland
vlaie
and
the
main
creek
where
remains
of
a
shanty
stood
on
the
bluff
above
the
right
bank
the
last
sign
of
man
beyond
lay
the
uncharted
land
skimped
and
shirked
entirely
in
certain
regions
by
an
unknown
wilderness
on
the
edges
of
which
selden
had
often
camped
when
deer
shooting
it
was
along
this
edge
he
was
leading
them
now
to
a
which
he
had
erected
and
from
which
he
had
travelled
in
to
glenwild
to
use
the
superintendent
telephone
to
new
york
there
seemed
to
be
no
animal
life
stirring
in
this
forest
their
torches
illuminated
no
fiery
orbs
of
dazed
wild
things
surprised
at
gaze
in
the
wilderness
no
leaping
furry
form
crossed
their
flashlights
radiance
there
were
no
nocturnal
birds
to
be
seen
or
heard
either
no
bittern
squawked
from
hidden
sloughs
no
herons
howled
not
an
not
a
whispering
cry
of
a
whippoorwill
not
the
sudden
uncanny
twitter
of
those
little
birds
that
become
abruptly
vocal
after
dark
interrupted
the
dense
stillness
of
the
forest
and
it
was
not
until
his
electric
torch
glimmered
repeatedly
upon
reaches
of
bog
that
cleves
understood
how
selden
took
his
bearings
for
the
night
was
thick
and
there
were
no
stars
yes
said
selden
tersely
i
trying
to
skirt
the
bog
until
i
shine
a
peeled
stick
an
hour
later
the
peeled
glittered
in
the
beam
of
the
torches
in
ten
minutes
something
white
caught
the
electric
rays
it
was
selden
spare
undershirt
drying
on
a
bush
behind
the
can
we
have
a
fire
asked
cleves
relieving
his
wife
of
her
pack
and
striding
into
the
camp
yes
i
fix
it
replied
selden
are
you
all
right
mrs
cleves
tressa
said
delightfully
tired
thank
you
and
smiled
faintly
at
her
husband
as
he
let
go
his
own
pack
knelt
and
spread
a
blanket
for
his
wife
he
remained
there
kneeling
as
she
seated
herself
are
you
quite
fit
he
asked
bluntly
yet
through
his
brusqueness
her
ear
caught
a
vague
undertone
of
something
else
anxiety
perhaps
perhaps
tenderness
and
her
heart
stirred
deliciously
in
her
breast
he
inflated
a
pillow
for
her
the
firelight
glimmered
brightened
spread
glowing
across
her
feet
she
lay
back
with
a
slight
sigh
relaxed
then
suddenly
the
thrill
of
her
husband
touch
flooded
her
face
with
colour
but
she
lay
motionless
one
arm
flung
across
her
eyes
while
he
unrolled
her
puttees
and
unlaced
her
muddy
shoes
a
heavenly
warmth
from
the
fire
dried
her
stockinged
feet
later
on
the
edge
of
sleep
she
opened
her
eyes
and
found
herself
propped
upright
on
her
husband
shoulder
drowsily
obediently
she
swallowed
spoonfuls
of
the
hot
broth
which
he
administered
are
you
really
quite
comfortable
dear
he
whispered
wonderfully
and
so
very
happy
thank
you
dear
she
lay
back
suffering
him
to
bathe
her
face
and
hands
with
warm
water
when
the
fire
was
only
a
heap
of
dying
coals
she
turned
over
on
her
right
side
and
extended
her
hand
a
little
way
into
the
darkness
searching
half
asleep
she
touched
her
husband
and
her
hand
relaxed
in
his
nervous
clasp
and
she
fell
into
the
most
perfect
sleep
which
she
had
known
in
years
she
dreamed
that
somebody
whispered
to
her
darling
darling
wake
up
it
is
morning
beloved
suddenly
she
opened
her
eyes
and
saw
her
husband
set
a
tray
freshly
plaited
out
of
indian
willow
beside
her
blanket
here
your
breakfast
pretty
lady
he
said
smilingly
and
over
there
is
an
exceedingly
frigid
pool
of
water
you
to
have
the
camp
to
yourself
for
the
next
hour
or
two
you
dear
fellow
she
murmured
still
confused
by
sleep
and
reached
out
to
touch
his
hand
he
caught
hers
and
kissed
it
back
and
palm
and
got
up
hastily
as
though
scared
selden
and
i
will
stand
sentry
he
muttered
there
is
no
hurry
you
know
she
heard
him
and
his
comrade
walking
away
over
dried
leaves
their
steps
receded
a
dry
stick
cracked
distantly
then
silence
stealthily
invaded
the
place
like
a
cautious
living
thing
creeping
unseen
through
the
golden
twilight
of
the
woods
seated
in
her
blanket
she
drank
the
coffee
ate
a
little
then
lay
down
again
in
the
early
sun
feeling
the
warmth
of
the
heap
of
whitening
coals
at
her
feet
also
for
an
hour
she
dozed
awake
drowsily
opening
her
eyes
now
and
then
to
look
across
the
glade
at
the
pool
over
which
a
single
glittered
on
guard
finally
she
rose
resolutely
grasped
a
bit
of
soap
and
went
down
to
the
edge
of
the
pool
tressa
was
in
flannel
shirt
and
knickers
when
her
husband
and
selden
hailed
the
camp
and
presently
appeared
walking
slowly
toward
the
dead
fire
their
grave
faces
checked
her
smile
of
greeting
her
husband
came
up
and
laid
one
hand
on
her
arm
looking
at
her
out
of
thoughtful
preoccupied
eyes
what
is
the
tchordagh
he
said
in
a
low
voice
the
girl
quiet
face
went
white
the
the
tchordagh
she
stammered
yes
dear
what
is
it
i
do
do
know
where
you
heard
that
term
she
whispered
the
tchordagh
is
the
the
power
of
erlik
it
is
a
term
in
it
is
comprehended
all
the
evil
all
the
cunning
all
the
perverted
spiritual
intelligence
of
evil
its
sinister
might
its
menace
it
is
an
term
and
it
is
written
in
brass
in
eighur
characters
on
the
eight
towers
and
on
the
rampart
of
gog
and
magog
nowhere
else
in
the
world
it
is
written
on
a
pine
tree
a
few
paces
from
this
camp
said
cleves
absently
selden
said
it
has
not
been
there
more
than
an
hour
or
two
cleves
a
square
of
bark
was
cut
out
and
on
the
white
surface
of
the
wood
this
word
is
written
in
english
can
you
tell
us
what
it
signifies
asked
cleves
quietly
tressa
studied
effort
at
was
apparent
to
both
men
she
said
when
that
word
is
written
then
it
is
a
death
struggle
between
all
the
powers
of
darkness
and
those
who
have
read
the
written
letters
of
that
word
for
it
is
written
in
the
iron
book
that
no
one
but
the
assassin
of
khorassan
excepting
the
eight
sheiks
shall
read
that
written
word
and
live
to
boast
of
having
read
it
let
us
sit
here
and
talk
it
over
said
selden
soberly
and
when
tressa
was
seated
on
a
fallen
log
and
cleves
settled
down
at
her
feet
selden
spoke
again
very
soberly
on
the
edges
of
these
woods
to
the
northwest
lies
a
sea
of
briers
close
growing
interwoven
and
matted
strong
and
murderous
as
barbed
wire
miles
out
in
this
almost
impenetrable
region
lies
a
patch
of
trees
called
fool
acre
at
wells
i
heard
that
the
only
man
who
had
ever
managed
to
reach
acre
was
a
trapper
and
that
he
was
still
living
i
found
him
at
rainbow
lake
a
very
old
man
who
had
a
fairly
clear
recollection
of
fool
acre
and
his
exhausting
journey
there
and
he
told
me
that
man
had
been
there
before
he
had
for
there
was
a
roofless
stone
house
there
and
the
remains
of
a
walled
garden
and
a
skull
deep
in
the
wild
grasses
selden
paused
and
looked
down
at
the
recently
healed
scars
on
his
wrists
and
hands
it
was
a
rotten
trip
he
said
bluntly
it
took
me
three
days
to
cut
a
tunnel
through
that
accursed
tangle
of
matted
brier
and
grey
birch
fool
acre
is
a
grove
of
giant
trees
first
growth
pine
oak
and
maple
great
outcrops
of
limestone
ledges
bound
it
on
the
east
a
brook
runs
through
the
woods
there
is
a
house
there
longer
and
built
of
slabs
of
limestone
the
glass
in
the
windows
is
so
old
that
it
is
iridescent
a
wall
encloses
the
house
built
also
of
slabs
blasted
out
of
the
rock
outcrop
and
all
pitted
with
fossil
shells
inside
is
a
garden
not
the
of
one
a
beautiful
garden
full
of
unfamiliar
flowers
and
in
this
garden
i
saw
the
yezidee
on
his
knees
living
things
out
of
lumps
of
dead
the
tchordagh
whispered
the
girl
what
was
the
yezidee
doing
demanded
cleves
nervously
involuntarily
all
three
drew
nearer
each
other
there
in
the
sunshine
it
was
difficult
for
me
to
see
said
selden
in
his
quiet
serious
voice
it
was
nearly
twilight
i
lay
flat
on
top
of
the
wall
under
the
curving
branches
of
a
huge
syringa
bush
in
full
bloom
the
yezidees
were
there
two
exclaimed
cleves
two
they
were
squatting
on
the
old
stone
path
bordering
one
of
the
he
turned
to
tressa
they
both
wore
white
cloths
twisted
around
their
heads
and
long
soft
garments
of
white
under
these
their
bare
brown
legs
showed
but
they
wore
things
on
their
naked
feet
which
were
shaped
like
what
we
call
turkish
slippers
only
different
black
and
green
nodded
tressa
with
the
vague
horror
growing
in
her
face
yes
the
soles
of
their
shoes
were
bright
green
green
is
the
colour
sacred
to
islam
said
tressa
the
priests
of
satan
defile
it
by
staining
with
green
the
soles
of
their
footwear
after
an
interval
go
on
said
cleves
nervously
selden
drew
closer
and
they
bent
their
heads
to
listen
i
do
even
now
know
what
the
yezidees
were
actually
doing
in
the
twilight
it
was
hard
to
see
clearly
but
i
tell
you
what
it
looked
like
to
me
one
of
these
squatting
creatures
would
scoop
out
a
handful
of
soil
from
the
and
mould
it
for
a
few
moments
between
his
lean
sinewy
fingers
and
then
he
open
his
hands
and
and
something
something
small
like
a
rat
or
a
toad
or
god
knows
what
would
escape
from
between
his
palms
and
run
out
into
the
grass
selden
voice
failed
and
he
looked
at
cleves
with
sickened
eyes
i
ca
ca
make
you
understand
how
repulsive
to
me
it
was
to
see
a
wriggling
live
thing
creep
out
between
their
fingers
and
and
go
running
or
scrambling
away
little
loathsome
things
with
humpy
backs
that
hopped
or
scurried
through
the
grass
what
on
earth
these
yezidees
doing
tressa
asked
cleves
almost
roughly
the
girl
white
face
was
marred
by
the
imprints
of
deepening
horror
it
is
the
she
said
mechanically
they
are
using
every
resource
of
hell
to
destroy
me
testing
the
gigantic
power
of
evil
as
though
it
were
some
vast
engine
charged
with
thunderous
destruction
and
they
were
testing
it
to
discover
its
terrific
capacity
to
annihilate
her
voice
died
in
her
dry
throat
she
dropped
her
bloodless
visage
into
both
hands
and
remained
seated
so
both
men
looked
at
her
in
silence
not
daring
to
interfere
finally
the
girl
lifted
her
pallid
face
from
her
hands
that
is
what
they
were
doing
she
said
in
a
dull
voice
out
of
inanimate
earth
they
were
making
things
animate
living
creatures
to
to
test
the
hellish
power
which
they
are
storing
concentrating
for
my
destruction
what
is
their
purpose
asked
cleves
harshly
what
do
these
mongol
sorcerers
expect
to
gain
by
making
little
live
things
out
of
lumps
of
garden
dirt
they
are
testing
their
power
whispered
the
girl
like
tuning
up
a
huge
machine
muttered
selden
yes
for
what
purpose
to
make
larger
living
creatures
out
of
of
clay
they
ca
they
ca
exclaimed
cleves
i
do
know
how
by
what
filthy
tricks
they
make
rats
out
of
dirt
but
they
make
a
anything
like
a
like
a
man
tressa
body
trembled
slightly
once
she
said
in
the
temple
prince
sanang
took
dust
which
was
brought
in
sacks
of
and
fashioned
the
heap
of
dirt
with
his
hands
so
that
it
resembled
the
body
of
a
man
lying
there
on
the
marble
floor
under
the
shrine
of
erlik
and
and
then
there
in
the
shadows
where
only
the
dark
star
burned
that
black
lamp
which
is
called
the
dark
star
the
long
heap
of
dust
lying
there
on
the
marble
pavement
began
to
to
she
pressed
both
hands
over
her
breast
as
though
to
control
her
trembling
body
i
saw
it
i
saw
the
long
shape
of
dust
begin
to
breathe
to
stir
move
and
slowly
lift
itself
a
yezidee
trick
gasped
cleves
but
he
also
was
trembling
now
god
whispered
the
girl
allah
alone
knows
the
merciful
the
long
suffering
he
knows
what
it
was
that
we
temple
girls
saw
there
that
yulun
saw
that
and
i
beheld
there
rising
up
like
a
man
from
the
marble
floor
and
standing
erect
in
the
shadowy
twilight
of
the
dark
star
her
hands
gripped
at
her
breast
her
face
was
deathly
then
she
said
i
saw
prince
sanang
draw
his
sabre
of
indian
steel
and
he
struck
once
only
and
a
dead
man
fell
down
where
the
had
stood
and
all
the
marble
was
flooded
with
scarlet
blood
a
trick
repeated
cleves
in
the
ghost
of
his
own
voice
but
his
gaze
grew
vacant
presently
selden
spoke
in
tones
that
sounded
weakly
querulous
from
emotional
reaction
there
is
a
path
a
tunnel
under
the
matted
briers
it
took
me
more
than
a
week
to
cut
it
out
it
is
possible
to
reach
fool
acre
we
can
try
with
our
rifles
if
you
say
so
mrs
cleves
the
girl
looked
up
a
little
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
she
shook
her
head
their
bodies
may
not
be
there
in
the
garden
she
said
absently
what
you
saw
may
not
have
been
that
part
of
them
the
material
which
dies
by
knife
or
bullet
and
it
is
necessary
that
these
yezidees
should
die
can
you
do
anything
asked
cleves
hoarsely
she
looked
at
her
husband
tried
to
smile
i
must
try
i
think
we
had
better
not
lose
any
time
if
selden
will
lead
us
now
yes
we
had
better
go
i
think
said
the
girl
her
smile
still
remained
stamped
on
her
lips
but
her
eyes
seemed
preoccupied
as
though
following
the
movements
of
something
remote
that
was
passing
across
the
far
horizon
chapter
xiv
a
death
trail
the
way
to
fool
acre
was
under
a
tangled
canopy
of
thorns
under
rotting
windfalls
of
grey
mirch
through
tunnel
after
tunnel
of
fallen
débris
woven
solidly
by
millions
of
strands
of
tough
which
cut
the
flesh
like
barbed
wire
there
was
blood
on
tressa
where
her
flannel
shirt
had
been
pierced
in
a
score
of
places
cleves
and
selden
had
been
painfully
slashed
silent
streams
flowed
darkling
under
the
tangled
mass
that
roofed
them
sometimes
they
could
move
upright
more
often
they
were
bent
double
and
there
were
long
stretches
where
they
had
to
creep
forward
on
hands
and
knees
through
sparse
wild
grasses
soft
rotten
soil
or
paths
of
sphagnum
which
cooled
their
feverish
skin
in
velvety
icy
depths
at
noon
they
rested
and
ate
lying
prone
under
the
matted
roof
of
their
tunnel
cleves
and
selden
had
their
rifles
tressa
lay
like
a
slender
boy
her
hands
empty
and
as
she
lay
there
her
husband
made
a
sponge
of
a
handful
of
sphagnum
moss
and
bathed
her
face
and
her
arms
cleansing
the
dried
blood
from
the
skin
while
the
girl
looked
up
at
him
out
of
grave
inscrutable
eyes
the
sun
hung
low
over
the
wilderness
when
they
came
to
the
woods
of
fool
acre
they
crept
cautiously
out
of
the
briers
among
ferns
and
open
spots
carpeted
with
pine
needles
and
dead
leaves
which
were
beginning
to
burn
ruddy
gold
under
the
level
rays
of
the
sun
lying
flat
behind
an
enormous
oak
they
remained
listening
for
a
while
selden
pointed
through
the
woods
eastward
whispering
that
the
house
stood
there
not
far
away
do
you
think
we
might
risk
the
chance
and
use
our
rifles
asked
cleves
in
a
low
voice
no
it
is
the
that
confronts
us
i
wish
to
talk
to
sansa
she
murmured
a
moment
later
selden
touched
her
arm
my
god
he
breathed
who
is
that
it
is
sansa
said
tressa
calmly
and
sat
up
among
the
ferns
and
the
next
instant
sansa
stepped
daintily
out
of
the
red
sunlight
and
seated
herself
among
them
without
a
sound
nobody
spoke
the
newcomer
glanced
at
selden
smiled
slightly
blushed
then
caught
a
glimpse
of
cleves
where
he
lay
in
the
brake
and
a
mischievous
glimmer
came
into
her
slanting
eyes
did
i
not
tell
my
lord
truths
she
inquired
in
a
demure
whisper
as
surely
as
the
sun
is
a
dragon
and
the
flaming
pearl
burns
between
his
claws
so
surely
burns
the
soul
of
heart
of
flame
between
thy
guarding
hands
there
are
as
many
words
as
there
are
demons
my
lord
but
it
is
written
that
is
the
greatest
of
all
words
save
only
the
name
of
god
she
laughed
without
any
sound
sweetly
malicious
where
she
sat
among
the
ferns
heart
of
flame
she
said
to
tressa
you
called
me
and
i
the
darling
said
tressa
in
her
thrilling
voice
the
yezidees
are
making
living
things
out
of
dust
as
sanang
noïane
made
that
thing
in
the
temple
and
slew
it
before
our
eyes
the
said
sansa
calmly
the
whispered
tressa
sansa
smooth
little
hands
crept
up
to
the
collar
of
her
odd
blue
tunic
grasped
it
in
the
name
of
god
the
merciful
she
said
without
a
tremor
listen
to
me
heart
of
flame
and
may
my
soul
be
ransom
for
yours
i
hear
you
sansa
sansa
said
her
fingers
still
grasping
the
embroidered
collar
of
her
tunic
yonder
behind
walls
two
tower
chiefs
meddle
with
the
making
living
things
out
of
the
senseless
dust
they
scrape
from
the
garden
selden
moistened
his
dry
lips
sansa
said
the
yezidees
who
have
come
into
this
wilderness
are
arrak
the
squirrel
and
tiyang
khan
may
god
remember
them
in
hell
may
god
remember
them
said
tressa
mechanically
and
these
two
yezidee
sorcerers
continued
sansa
coolly
have
advanced
thus
far
in
the
for
they
now
roam
these
woods
digging
like
demons
for
the
roots
of
ginseng
and
thou
knowest
o
heart
of
flame
what
that
indicates
does
ginseng
grow
in
these
woods
exclaimed
tressa
with
a
new
terror
in
her
widening
eyes
ginseng
grows
here
little
and
the
roots
are
as
perfect
as
human
bodies
and
tiyang
khan
squats
in
the
walled
garden
moulding
the
ginseng

scratches
among
the
dead
leaves
of
the
woods
for
roots
as
perfect
as
a
naked
human
body
all
day
long
the
rummages
among

all

long
tiyang

and
rubs
and

a

with
you

and
when
the

comes
so
shall
my
lord
slay
him
with
a
bullet
and
when

she
turned
to
tressa
and
caught
her
hands
in
both
of
her
own
it
is
written
on
the
iron
pages
she
whispered
that
we
belong
to
erlik
and
we
return
to
him
but
in
the
book
of
gold
it
is
written
otherwise

stoned
therefore

the
name
of
allah
now
then
heart

your
duty
a
burning
flush
leaped
over
tressa
features
is
my
soul
then
my
own
it
belongs
to
god
said
sansa
gravely
and
sanang
god
is
greatest
but
was
god
there
at
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
god
is
everywhere
it
is
so
written
in
the
book
of
gold
replied
sansa
pressing
her
hands
tenderly
recite
the
fatha
heart
of
flame
thy
lips
shall
not
stiffen
god
listens
tressa
rose
in
the
sunset
glory
and
stood
as
though
dazed
and
all
crimsoned
in
the
last
fiery
bars
of
the
declining
sun
cleves
also
rose
sansa
laughed
noiselessly
my
lord
would
go
whither
thou
goest
heart
of
fire
she
whispered
and
thy
ways
shall
be
his
ways
tressa
cheeks
flamed
and
she
turned
and
looked
at
cleves
then
sansa
rose
and
laid
a
hand
on
tressa
arm
and
on
her
husband
listen
attentively
tiyang
khan
must
be
destroyed
the
signal
sounds
when
my
lord
makes
a
loud
noise
here
among
these
trees
can
i
prevail
against
the
asked
tressa
steadily
is
not
that
event
already
in
god
hands
darling
said
sansa
softly
she
smiled
and
resumed
her
seat
beside
selden
amid
the
drooping
fern
fronds
bid
thy
dear
lord
leave
his
rifle
here
she
added
quietly
cleves
laid
down
his
weapon
selden
pointed
eastward
in
silence
so
they
went
together
into
the
darkening
woods
in
the
dusk
of
heavy
foliage
overhanging
the
garden
tressa
lay
flat
as
a
lizard
on
the
top
of
the
wall
beside
her
lay
her
husband
in
the
garden
below
them
flowers
bloomed
in
scented
thickets
bordered
by
walks
of
flat
stone
slabs
split
from
boulders
a
little
lawn
very
green
centred
the
garden
and
on
this
lawn
in
the
clear
twilight
still
tinged
with
the
sombre
fires
of
sundown
squatted
a
man
dressed
in
a
loose
white
garment
save
for
a
twisted
breadth
of
white
cloth
his
shaven
head
was
bare
his
sinewy
feet
were
naked
too
the
lean
brown
toes
buried
in
the
grass
tressa
lips
touched
her
husband
ear
tiyang
khan
she
breathed
watch
what
he
does
shoulder
to
shoulder
they
lay
there
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
their
eyes
were
fastened
on
the
mongol
sorcerer
who
squatted
below
on
his
haunches
grave
and
deliberate
as
a
great
grey
ape
continued
busy
with
the
obscure
business
which
so
intently
preoccupied
him
in
a
short
on
the
grass
in
front
of
him
he
had
placed
a
dozen
wild
ginseng
roots
the
roots
were
enormous
astoundingly
shaped
like
the
human
body
almost
repulsive
in
their
weird
symmetry
the
yezidee
had
taken
one
of
these
roots
into
his
hands
squatting
there
in
the
he
began
to
massage
it
between
his
long
muscular
fingers
rubbing
moulding
pressing
the
root
with
caressing
deliberation
his
unhurried
manipulation
for
a
few
moments
seemed
to
produce
no
result
but
presently
the
ginseng
root
became
lighter
in
colour
and
more
supple
yielding
to
his
fingers
growing
ivory
pale
sinuously
limber
in
a
newer
and
more
delicate
symmetry
look
gasped
cleves
grasping
his
wife
arm
is
that
man
doing
the
whispered
tressa
do
you
see
what
lies
twisting
there
in
his
hands
the
ginseng
root
had
become
the
tiny
naked
body
of
a
woman
a
little
creature
struggling
to
escape
between
the
hands
that
had
created
it
dark
powerful
masterly
hands
opening
leisurely
now
and
releasing
the
living
being
they
had
fashioned
the
thing
scrambled
between
the
fingers
of
the
sorcerer
leaped
into
the
grass
ran
a
little
way
and
hid
crouched
down
panting
almost
hidden
by
the
long
grass
the
shocked
watchers
on
the
wall
could
still
see
the
creature
tressa
felt
cleves
body
trembling
beside
her
she
rested
a
cool
steady
hand
on
his
it
is
the
she
breathed
close
to
his
face
the
mongol
sorcerer
is
becoming
formidable
oh
god
murmured
cleves
that
thing
he
made
is
i
saw
it
i
can
see
it
hiding
there
in
the
grass
it
frightened
breathing
alive
his
pistol
clutched
in
his
right
hand
quivered
his
wife
laid
her
hand
on
it
and
cautiously
shook
her
head
no
she
said
that
is
of
no
use
but
what
that
yezidee
is
doing
is
is
blasphemous
watch
him
his
mind
is
stealthily
feeling
its
way
among
the
laws
and
secrets
of
the
he
has
found
a
thread
he
is
following
it
through
the
maze
into
hell
own
labyrinth
he
has
created
a
tiny
thing
in
the
image
of
the
creator
he
will
try
to
create
a
larger
being
now
watch
him
with
his
ginseng
roots
tiyang
looming
on
his
haunches
in
the
deepening
dusk
moulded
and
massaged
the
ginseng
roots
one
after
another
and
one
after
another
tiny
naked
creatures
wriggled
out
of
his
palms
between
his
fingers
and
scuttled
away
into
the
herbage
already
the
dim
lawn
was
alive
with
them
crawling
scurrying
through
the
grass
creeping
in
among
the
little
things
that
glimmered
from
shade
into
shadow
like
moonbeams
tressa
mouth
touched
her
husband
ear
it
is
for
the
secret
of
destruction
that
the
yezidee
seeks
but
first
he
must
learn
the
secret
of
creation
he
is
learning
and
he
must
learn
no
more
than
he
has
already
learned
that
yezidee
is
a
living
man
shall
i
fire
no
i
can
kill
him
with
the
first
shot
hark
she
whispered
excitedly
her
hand
closing
convulsively
on
her
husband
arm
the
of
a
still
crackled
in
their
ears
tiyang
had
leaped
to
his
feet
in
the
dusk
a
ginseng
root
hanging
from
one
hand
and
beginning
to
squirm
suddenly
the
first
moonbeam
fell
across
the
wall
and
in
its
lustre
tressa
rose
to
her
knees
and
flung
up
her
right
hand
then
it
was
as
though
her
palm
caught
and
reflected
the
moon
ray
and
hurled
it
in
one
blinding
shaft
straight
into
the
dark
visage
of
the
yezidee
fell
as
though
he
had
been
pierced
by
a
shaft
of
steel
and
lay
sprawling
there
on
the
grass
in
the
ghastly
glare
and
where
his
features
had
been
there
gaped
only
a
hole
into
the
head
then
a
dreadful
thing
occurred
for
everywhere
the
grass
swarmed
with
the
little
naked
creatures
he
had
made
running
scrambling
scuttling
darting
into
the
black
hole
which
had
been
the
face
of
they
poured
into
the
awful
orifice
crowding
jostling
one
another
so
violently
that
the
head
jerked
from
side
to
side
on
the
grass
a
wabbling
inert
soggy
mass
in
the
moonlight
and
presently
the
body
of
warden
of
the
rampart
of
gog
and
magog
and
lord
of
the
seventh
tower
began
to
burn
with
white
fire
a
low
glimmering
combustion
that
seemed
to
clothe
the
limbs
like
an
incandescent
mist
on
the
wall
knelt
tressa
the
glare
from
her
lifted
hand
streaming
over
the
burning
form
below
cleves
stood
tall
and
shadowy
beside
his
wife
the
useless
pistol
hanging
in
his
grasp
then
in
the
silence
of
the
woods
and
very
near
they
heard
sansa
laughing
and
selden
anxious
voice
arrak
is
dead
the
hangs
across
a
rock
head
down
like
a
shot
squirrel
is
all
well
with
you
tiyang
is
on
his
way
to
his
star
said
tressa
calmly
somewhere
in
the
world
his
body
has
bid
its
mind
farewell
and
so
his
body
may
live
for
a
little
blind
in
mental
darkness
fed
by
others
and
locked
in
all
day
all
night
until
the
end
sansa
at
the
base
of
the
wall
turned
to
selden
shall
i
bring
my
body
with
me
one
day
my
lord
she
asked
demurely
oh
sansa
he
whispered
but
she
placed
a
fragrant
hand
across
his
lips
and
laughed
at
him
in
the
moonlight
chapter

in

in

shock
of
the
red
surf
pounding
the
frontiers
of
civilisation
from
pole

up
out

boiled

dashing

england
with
its

now
the

rain
was
sprinkling
the
united
states
from

to
coast
and
the
mindless
administration
scared
out
of
its
stupidity
at
last
began
a
frantic
attempt
to
drain
the
country
of
the
filthy
flood
and
throw
up
barriers
against
the
threatened
deluge
in
every

too
late
a
million
minds
had
already
been
perverted
and
dominated
by

terrible
sect
of

assassins
a
million
more
were
sickening
under
the
awful
psychic
power
of
the
yezidee
thousands
of
the
disciples
of

yezidee
had
already
been
arrested
and
held
for
deportation
poor
wretched
creatures
whose
minds
were
no
longer
their
own
but
had
been
stealthily
surprised
seized
and
mastered
by
mongol
adepts
and
filled
with
ferocious
hatred
against

of

only
two

remained
alive
in

togrul

arrak
the

all
were
dead
six

had
become
dark
and
silent
from

the

evil
thought
the
last
evil
shape
had
sped
the

wicked
prayer

his

lived
and
at

stole

to

noïane
the
slayer

in
the

there
had
been
a
cessation
of
the
active
campaign
of
violence
toward
those
in
authority
such
unhappy
dupes
of
the
yezidees
as

physically
quiescent

with

brutal
outrages
against

ceased
but
two
million
sullen
eyes
in
which
all
independent
human
thought
had
been
extinguished
watched
unblinking
the
wholesale
arrests
by
the
government
watched
officials
rushing
hither
and
thither
to
execute
the
mandate
of
a
miserable
administration
watched
and
waited
in
dreadful
silence
in
that
period
of
ominous
quiet
which
possessed
the
land
the
little
group
of
secret
service
men
that
surrounded
the
young
girl
who
alone
stood
between
a
trembling
civilisation
and
the
threat
of
hell
own
chaos
became
convinced
that
sanang
was
preparing
a
final
and
terrible
effort
to
utterly
overwhelm
the
last
vestige
of
civilisation
in
the
united
states
what
shape
that
plan
would
develop
they
could
not
guess
john
recklow
sent
benton
to
chicago
to
watch
that
centre
of
infection
for
the
appearance
there
of
the
yezidee
togrul
selden
went
to
boston
where
a
group
of
at
cambridge
were
talking
too
loudly
and
loosely
to
please
even
the
most
tolerant
at
harvard
but
neither
togrul
nor
sanang
had
so
far
materialised
in
either
city
and
john
recklow
prowled
the
purlieus
of
new
york
haunting
strange
byways
and
obscure
quarters
where
the
dull
embers
of
revolution
always
smouldered
watching
for
the
yezidee
who
was
the
vital
root
of
this
psychic
evil
which
menaced
the
minds
of
all
mankind
sanang
the

recklow
lodgings
were
tucked
away
in

court
three
bedrooms
a
parlour
and
a
kitchenette
tressa
cleves
occupied
one
bedroom
her
husband
another
recklow
the
third
and
in
this
tiny
apartment
hidden
away
among
a
group
of
old
buildings
the
very
existence
of
which
was
unknown
to
the
millions
who
swarmed
the
streets
of
the
greatest
city
in
the
world
here
in
westover
court
a
dozen
paces
from
the
roar
of
broadway
was
now
living
a
young
girl
upon
whose
psychic
power
the
only
hope
of
the
world
now
rested
the
afternoon
had
turned
grey
and
bitter
ragged
flakes
still
fell
a
pallid
twilight
possessed
the
snowy
city
through
which
lighted
trains
and
taxis
moved
in
the
foggy
gloom
by
three
in
the
afternoon
all
shops
were
illuminated
the
south
windows
of
the
hotel
astor
across
the
street
spread
a
sickly
light
over
the
old
buildings
of
westover
court
as
john
recklow
entered
the
tiled
hallway
took
the
stairs
to
the
left
and
went
directly
to
his
apartment
he
unlocked
the
door
and
let
himself
in
and
stood
a
moment
in
the
entry
shaking
the
snow
from
his
hat
and
overcoat
the
lamp
was
unlighted
but
he
could
see
a
fire
in
the
grate
and
tressa
cleves
seated
near
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
glowing
coals
he
bade
her
good
evening
in
a
low
voice
she
turned
her
charming
head
and
nodded
and
he
drew
a
chair
to
the
fender
and
stretched
out
his
wet
shoes
to
the
warmth
is
victor
still
out
he
inquired
she
said
that
her
husband
had
not
yet
returned
her
eyes
were
on
the
fire
recklow
rested
on
her
shadowy
face
benton
got
his
man
in
chicago

said
it
was
not
togrul

it
only
a
swami
fakir
who

preaching
sedition
to
a
little
group
of
greasy
bengalese
from
seattle
i
heard
from
selden

she
nodded
listlessly
and
lifted
her
eyes
neither
sanang
nor
togrul
have
appeared
in
boston
he
said
i
think
they
here
in
new
york
the
girl
said
nothing
after
a
silence
are
you
worried
about
your
husband
he
asked
abruptly
i
am
always
uneasy
when
he
is
absent
she
said
quietly
of
course
but
i
do
suppose
he
knows
that
i
suppose
not
recklow
leaned
over
took
a
coal
in
the
tongs
and
lighted
a
cigar
leaning
back
in
his
armchair
he
said
in
a
musing
voice
no
i
suppose
your
husband
does
not
realise
that
you
are
so
deeply
concerned
over
his
welfare
the
girl
remained
silent
i
suppose
said
recklow
softly
he
does
dream
you
are
in
love
with
him
tressa
cleves
did
not
stir
a
muscle
after
a
long
silence
she
said
in
her
even
voice
do
you
think
i
am
in
love
with
my
husband
mr
recklow
i
think
you
fell
in
love
with
him
the
first
evening
you
met
him
i
did
neither
of
them
spoke
again
for
some
minutes
recklow
cigar
went
wrong
he
rose
and
found
another
and
returned
to
the
fire
but
did
not
light
it
it
a
rotten
day
is
it
he
said
with
a
shiver
and
dumped
a
scuttle
of
coal
on
the
fire
they
watched
the
blue
flames
playing
over
the
grate
tressa
said
i
could
no
more
help
falling
in
love
with
him
than
i
could
stop
my
heart
beating
but
i
did
not
dream
that
anybody
knew
do
you
think
he
ought
to
know
why
he
is
not
in
love
with
me
are
you
sure
mrs
cleves
yes
he
is
wonderfully
sweet
and
kind
but

have
been
recklow
smiled
what
have
you
been
tressa
norne

voice

recklow
peering
at
her
averted
face
through
the
reddening
firelight
she
lay
still
in
her
chair
for
a
moment
then
turned
suddenly
on
him
he
slay
it
he
came
to
the
lake
of
the
ghosts
as
my

but
i
would
not

his
touch
i
mocked
at
him
and
his
passion
i
laughed
at
his
tchortchas
they
were
afraid
of
me
she
half
rose
from
her
chair
grasped
the
arms
then
seated
herself
again
her
eyes
ablaze
with
the
memory
of
wrongs
how
dare
i
show
my
dear
lord
that
i
am
in
love
with
him
when
soul
caught
my
soul
out
of
my
body
one
day
surprised
my
soul
while
my
body
lay
asleep
in
the
yezidee
temple
and
bore
it
in
his
arms
to
the
very
gates
of
hell
good
god
whispered
recklow
what
do
you
mean
such
things
happen
why
not
they
do
happen
i
was
caught
unawares
it
was
one
golden
afternoon
and
yulan
and
sansa
and
i
were
eating
oranges
by
the
fountain
in
the
inner
shrine
and
i
lay
down
by
the
pool
and
the
you
understand
yes
very
well
my
soul
left
my
body
asleep
and
i
went
out
over
the
tops
of
the
flowers
idly
without
aim
or
intent
as
the
winds
blow
in
summer
it
was
in
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
that
i
saw
sanang
soul
flash
downward
like
a
streak
of
fire
and
wrap
my
soul
in
flame
and
in
a
flash
we
were
at
the
gates
of
hell
before
i
could
free
myself
from
his
embrace
then
by
the
temple
pool
among
the
oranges
i
cried
out
asleep
and
my
terrified
body
sat
up
sobbing
and
trembling
in
arms
but
the
slayer
of
souls
had
slain
mine
in
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
slain
it
as
he
caught
me
in
his
flaming
arms
and
now
you
know
why
such
a
woman
as
i
dare
not
bend
to
kiss
the
dust
from
my
dear
feet
i
who
have
lost
my
girl
soul
to
him
who
slew
it
in
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
she
sat
rocking
in
her
chair
in
the
red
firelight
her
hands
framing
her
lovely
face
her
eyes
staring
straight
ahead
as
though
they
saw
opening
before
them
through
the
sombre
shadows
of
that
room
all
the
dread
magic
of
the
east
where
the
dancing
flame
of
sanang
blazing
soul
lighted
their
path
to
hell
through
the
enchanted
forest
recklow
had
grown
pale
but
his
voice
was
steady
i
see
no
reason
he
said
why
your
husband
should
not
love
you
i
tell
you
my
girl
soul
belonged
to
sanang
was
part
of
his
for
an
instant

is
burned
pure
of
dross

is
recklow
remained
silent
tressa
lay
deep
in
her
armchair
twisting
her
white
fingers
what
makes
him
so
late
she
said
i
sent
my
soul
out
twice
to
look
for
him
and
could
not
find
him
send
it
again
said
recklow
fearfully
for
ten
minutes
the
girl
lay
as
though
asleep
then
her
eyes
unclosed
and
she
said
drowsily
i
can
not
find
him
did
did
you
learn
anything
while
while
you
were
away
asked
recklow
cautiously
nothing
there
is
a
thick
darkness
out
there
i
mean
a
darkness
gathering
over
the
whole
land
it
is
like
a
black
fog
when
the
damned
pray
to
erlik
there
is
a
darkness
that
gathers
like
a
brown
mist
her
voice
ceased
her
hands
tightened
on
the
arms
of
her
chair
is
what
sanang
is
doing
she
said
in
a
breathless
voice
what
demanded
recklow
that
is
what
he
is
doing
a
million
perverted
minds
which
he
has
seized
and
obsessed
are
being
concentrated
on
blasphemous
prayers
to
erlik
sanang
is
directing
them
do
you
understand
the
terrible
power
of
a
million
minds
all
in
unison
the
destruction
of
good
and
the
triumph
of
evil
a
million
human
minds
more
for
that
is
what
he
is
doing
that
is
the
thick
darkness
that
is
gathering
over
the
entire
western
world
it
is
the
terrific
materialisation
of
evil
power
from
evil
minds
all
focussed
upon
the
single
thought
that
evil
must
triumph
and
good
die
she
sat
gripping
the
arms
of
her
chair
pale
rigid
terribly
alert
dreadfully
enlightened
now
concerning
the
awful
and
new
menace
threatening
the
sanity
of
mankind
she
said
in
her
steady
emotionless
voice
when
the
yezidee
sorcerers
desire
to
overwhelm
a
nomad
people
some
yort
perhaps
that
has
resisted
the
sheiks
of
the
eight
towers
then
the
slayer
of
souls
rides
with
his
black
banners
to
the
or
place
of
prayer
two
marble
bridges
lead
to
it
there
are
fourteen
hundred
mosques
there
then
come
the
eight
each
with
his
shroud
chanting
the
prayers
for
those
dead
in
hell
and
there
the
yezidees
pray
blasphemously
all
their
minds
in
ferocious
unison
and
i
have
seen
a
little
yort
full
of
broad
faces
with
their
slanting
eyes
and
sparse
beards
sicken
and
die
and
turn
black
in
the
sun
as
though
the
plague
had
breathed
on
them
and
i
have
seen
the
long
noses
and
bushy
beards
of
walled
towns
wither
and
perish
in
the
blast
and
blight
from
the
where
the
slayer
of
souls
sat
his
saddle
and
prayed
to
erlik
and
half
a
million
yezidees
prayed
in
blasphemous
unison
recklow
head
rested
on
his
left
hand
the
other
unconsciously
had
crept
toward
his
pistol
the
weapon
which
had
become
so
useless
in
this
awful
struggle
between
this
girl
and
the
loosened
forces
of
hell
is
that
what
you
think
sanang
is
about
he
asked
heavily
yes
i
know
it
he
has
seized
the
minds
of
a
million
men
in
america
every
anarchist
is
concentrating
in
one
evil
and
supreme
mental
effort
under
sanang
direction
to
will
the
triumph
of
evil
and
the
doom
of
civilisation
i
wish
my
husband
would
come
home
tressa
she
turned
her
pallid
face
in
the
firelight
if
sanang
has
appointed
a
place
of
prayer
she
said
he
himself
will
pray
on
that
spot
that
will
be
the
for
the
last
two
yezidee
sorcerers
still
alive
in
the
western
world

sighed
and
closed
her
eyes
again
she
lay
like
one
dead
there
was
no
sound
in
the
room

the
soft
purr
of
the
fire

faintly
and
an
exclamation
from

down
the
marble
steps
to
the
left
and
out
to
the
snowy
sidewalk
passing
on
his
way
a
young
girl
swathed
to
the
eyes
in
chinchilla
who
was
hurrying
into
the
hotel
as
he
came
to
where
the
limousine
was
standing
he
saw
that
it
was
still
empty
although
the
door
stood
open
and
the
engine
was
running
around
the
chauffeur
stood
the
gold
laced
doorman
the
gorgeously
uniformed
carriage

a

cleves

he
turned
and
hurried
into
the
hotel
traversed
peacock
alley
scanning
every
woman
he
passed
searching
for
a
slim
shape
swathed
in
chinchilla
there
were
no
chinchilla
wraps
in
peacock
alley
none
in
the
where
people
already
were
beginning
to
gather
and
the
orchestra
was
now
playing
no
young
girl
in
chinchilla
in
the
waiting
room
or
in
the
north
then
suddenly
far
across
the
crowded
lobby
he
saw
a
slender
girl
in
a
chinchilla
cloak
turn
hurriedly
away
from
the
desk
holding
a
key
in
her
white
gloved
hand
before
he
could
take
two
steps
in
her
direction
she
had
disappeared
in
the
crowd
he
made
his
way
through
the
packed
lobby
as
best
he
could
amid
throngs
of
people
dressed
for
dinner
theatre
or
other
gaiety
awaiting
them
somewhere
out
there
in
the
winter
fog
but
when
he
arrived
at
the
room
clerk
desk
he
looked
for
a
chinchilla
wrap
in
vain
then
he
leaned
over
the
desk
and
said
to
the
clerk
in
a
low
voice
i
am
a
federal
agent
from
the
department
of
justice
here
are
my
credentials
now
who
was
that
young
woman
in
chinchilla
furs
to
whom
you
gave
her
door
key
a
moment
ago
the
clerk
leaned
over
his
counter
and
dropping
his
voice
answered
that
the
lady
in
question
had
arrived
only
that
morning
from
san
francisco
had
registered
as
madame
aoula
baroulass
and
had
been
given
a
suite
on
the
fourth
floor
numbered
from
to
do
you
mean
to
arrest
her
added
the
clerk
in
a
weird
whisper
i
do
know
possibly
have
you
the
the
clerk
handed
it
to
him
without
a
word
and
cleves
hurried
to
the
elevator
on
the
fourth
floor
the
matron
on
duty
halted
him
but
when
he
murmured
an
explanation
she
nodded
and
laid
a
finger
on
her
lips
madame
has
gone
to
her
apartment
she
whispered
has
she
a
servant
or
friends
with
her
no
sir
i
did
see
her
speak
to
two
foreign
looking
gentlemen
in
the
elevator
when
she
arrived
this
morning
cleves
nodded
the
matron
pointed
out
the
direction
in
silence
and
he
went
rapidly
down
the
carpeted
corridor
until
he
came
to
a
door
numbered
for
a
second
only
he
hesitated
then
swiftly
fitted
the
and
opened
the
door
the
room
a
bedroom
was
brightly
lighted
but
there
was
nobody
there
the
other
rooms
dressing
closet
and
parlour
all
were
brilliantly
lighted
by
ceiling
fixtures
and
wall
brackets
but
there
was
not
a
person
to
be
seen
in
any
of
the
rooms
nor
save
for
the
illumination
was
there
any
visible
sign
that
anybody
inhabited
the
apartment
swiftly
he
searched
the
apartment
from
end
to
end
there
was
no
baggage
to
be
seen
no
garments
no
toilet
articles
no
flowers
in
the
vases
no
magazines
or
books
not
one
article
of
feminine
apparel
or
of
personal
visible
in
the
entire
place
nor
had
the
bed
even
been
turned
down
nor
any
preparation
for
the
night
comfort
been
attempted
and
except
for
the
blazing
lights
it
was
as
though
the
apartment
had
not
been
entered
by
anybody
for
a
month
all
the
windows
were
closed
all
shades
lowered
and
curtains
drawn
the
air
though
apparently
pure
enough
had
that
vague
flatness
which
one
associates
with
an
unused
when
opened
for
an
airing
now
deliberately
cleves
began
a
more
thorough
search
of
the
apartment
looking
behind
curtains
under
beds
into
clothes
presses
behind
sofas
then
he
searched
the
bureau
drawers
dressers
desks
for
any
sign
or
clew
of
the
girl
in
the
chinchillas
there
was
no
dust
anywhere
the
hotel
management
evidently
was
particular
but
there
was
not
even
a
pin
to
be
found
presently
he
went
out
into
the
corridor
and
looked
again
at
the
number
on
the
door
he
had
made
no
mistake
then
he
turned
and
sped
down
the
long
corridor
to
where
the
matron
was
standing
beside
her
desk
preparing
to
go
off
duty
as
soon
as
the
other
matron
arrived
to
relieve
her
to
his
impatient
question
she
replied
positively
that
she
had
seen
the
girl
in
chinchillas
unlock
and
enter
the
apartment
less
than
five
minutes
before
he
had
arrived
in
pursuit
and
i
saw
her
lights
go
on
as
soon
as
she
went
in
added
the
matron
pointing
to
the
distant
illuminated
transom
then
she
went
out
through
into
the
next
apartment
insisted
cleves
the
is
on
one
side
of
her
the
scullery
closet
on
the
other
said
the
matron
she
could
not
have
left
that
apartment
without
coming
out
into
the
corridor
and
if
she
had
come
out
i
should
have
seen
her
i
tell
you
she
is
in
those
rooms
protested
cleves
she
must
be
there
sir
i
saw
her
go
in
a
few
seconds
before
you
came
up
at
that
moment
the
other
matron
arrived
there
was
no
use
arguing
he
left
the
explanation
of
the
situation
to
the
woman
who
was
going
off
duty
and
hastening
his
steps
he
returned
to
apartment
the
door
which
he
had
left
open
had
swung
shut
again
he
fitted
the
entered
paused
on
the
threshold
looked
around
nervously
his
nostrils
suddenly
filled
with
a
puff
of
perfume
and
there
on
the
table
by
the
bed
he
saw
a
glass
bowl
filled
with
a
mass
of
chinese
orchids
great
odorous
clusters
of
orange
and
bloom
that
saturated
all
the
room
with
their
freshening
scent
so
astounded
was
he
that
he
stood
stock
still
one
hand
still
on
the
then
in
a
trice
he
had
closed
and
locked
the
door
from
inside
was
in
that
apartment
there
could
be
no
doubt
about
it
he
dropped
his
right
hand
into
his
overcoat
pocket
and
took
hold
of
his
automatic
pistol
for
ten
minutes
he
stood
so
listening
peering
about
the
room
from
bed
to
curtains
and
out
into
the
parlour
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
place
nothing
stirred
now
grasping
his
pistol
but
not
drawing
it
he
began
another
stealthy
tour
of
the
apartment
exploring
every
nook
and
cranny
and
at
the
end
had
discovered
nothing
new
when
at
length
he
realised
that
as
far
as
he
could
discover
there
was
not
a
living
thing
in
the
place
excepting
himself
a
very
faint
chill
grew
along
his
neck
and
shoulders
and
he
caught
his
breath
suddenly
deeply
he
had
come
back
to
the
bedroom
now
the
perfume
of
the
orchids
saturated
the
still
air
and
as
he
stood
staring
at
them
all
of
a
sudden
he
saw
where
their
twisted
stalks
rested
in
the
transparent
bowl
of
water
something
moving
something
brilliant
as
a
live
ember
gliding
out
from
among
the
mass
of
submerged
stems
a
living
fish
glowing
in
scarlet
hues
and
winnowing
the
water
with
grotesquely
trailing
fins
as
delicate
as
filaments
of
scarlet
lace
to
and
fro
swam
the
fish
among
the
maze
of
orchid
stalks
even
its
eyes
were
hot
and
red
as
molten
rubies
and
as
its
crimson
gills
swelled
and
relaxed
and
swelled
tints
of
waxed
and
waned
over
its
fat
and
glowing
body
and
vaguely
now
in
the
perfume
saturated
air
cleves
seemed
to
sense
a
subtle
taint
of
evil
something
sinister
in
the
intense
stillness
of
the
place
in
the
jewelled
fish
gliding
so
silently
in
and
out
among
the
pallid
convolutions
of
the
drowned
stems
as
he
stood
staring
at
the
fish
the
drugged
odour
of
the
orchids
heavy
in
his
throat
and
lungs
something
stirred
very
lightly
in
the
room
chills
crawling
over
every
limb
he
looked
around
across
his
shoulder
there
was
a
figure
seated
in
the
middle
of
the
bed
then
in
the
perfumed
silence
the
girl
laughed
for
a
full
minute
neither
of
them
moved
no
sound
had
echoed
her
low
laughter
save
the
deadened
pulsations
of
his
own
heart
but
now
there
grew
a
faint
ripple
of
water
in
the
bowl
where
the
scarlet
fish
suddenly
restless
was
swimming
hither
and
thither
as
though
pursued
by
an
invisible
hand
with
the
slight
noise
of
splashing
water
in
his
ears
cleves
stood
staring
at
the
figure
on
the
bed
under
her
chinchilla
the
girl
seemed
to
be
all
a
pale
golden
tint
hair
skin
eyes
the
scant
shred
of
an
evening
gown
she
wore
the
jewels
at
her
throat
and
breast
all
were
yellow
and
amber
and
and
now
looking
him
in
the
eyes
she
leisurely
disengaged
the
robe
of
silver
fur
from
her
naked
shoulders
and
let
it
fall
around
her
on
the
bed
for
a
second
the
lithe
willowy
golden
thing
gathered
there
as
gracefully
as
a
coiled
snake
filled
him
with
swift
loathing
then
almost
instantly
the
beauty
of
the
lissome
creature
fascinated
him
she
leaned
forward
and
set
her
elbows
on
her
two
knees
and
rested
her
face
between
her
hands
like
a
gold
between
two
ivory
petals
he
thought
dismayed
by
this
young
thing
beauty
shaken
by
the
dull
confusion
of
his
own
heart
battering
his
breast
like
the
blows
of
a
rising
tide
what
do
you
wish
she
inquired
in
her
soft
young
voice
why
have
you
come
secretly
into
my
rooms
to
search
and
clasping
in
your
hand
a
loaded
pistol
deep
within
your
pocket
why
have
you
hidden
yourself
until
now
he
retorted
in
a
dull
and
laboured
voice
i
have
been
here
where
here
looking
at
you
and
watching
my
scarlet
fish
his
name
is
dzelim
he
is
nearly
a
thousand
years
old
and
as
wise
as
a
magician
look
upon
him
my
lord
see
how
rapidly
he
darts
around
his
tiny
crystal
world
like
a
comet
through
outer
running
the
eternal
race
with
time
and
yonder
is
a
chair
will
my
lord
be
seated
at
his
new
servant
feet
a
strange
physical
weariness
seemed
to
weight
his
limbs
and
shoulders
he
seated
himself
near
the
bed
never
taking
his
heavy
gaze
from
the
smiling
golden
thing
which
squatted
there
watching
him
so
intently
whose
limousine
was
that
which
you
entered
and
then
left
so
abruptly
he
asked
my
own
what
was
the
yezidee
togrul
kahn
doing
in
it
did
you
see
anybody
in
my
car
she
asked
veiling
her
eyes
a
little
with
their
tawny
lashes
i
saw
a
man
with
a
thick
beard
dyed
red
with
henna
and
the
bony
face
and
slant
eyes
of
togrul
the
yezidee
may
my
soul
be
ransom
for
yours
my
lord
but
you
lie
she
said
softly
her
lips
parted
in
a
smile
but
her
eyes
were
brilliant
as
two
topazes
is
that
your
answer
she
lifted
one
hand
and
with
her
forefinger
made
signs
from
right
to
left
and
then
downward
as
though
writing
in
turkish
and
in
chinese
characters
it
is
written
she
said
in
a
low
voice
that
we
belong
to
god
and
we
return
to
him
look
out
what
you
are
about
my
lord
he
drew
his
pistol
from
his
overcoat
and
holding
it
rested
his
hand
on
his
knee
now
he
said
hoarsely
while
we
await
the
coming
of
togrul
kahn
you
shall
remain
exactly
where
you
are
and
you
shall
tell
me
exactly
who
you
are
in
order
that
i
may
decide
whether
to
arrest
you
as
an
alien
enemy
inciting
my
countrymen
to
murder
or
to
let
you
go
as
a
foreigner
who
is
able
to
prove
her
honesty
and
innocence
the
girl
laughed
be
careful
she
said
my
danger
lies
in
your
youth
and
mine
somewhere
between
your
lips
and
mine
lies
my
only
danger
from
you
my
lord
a
dull
flush
mounted
to
his
temples
and
burned
there
i
am
the
golden
comrade
to
she
said
still
smiling
i
am
the
third
immaum
in
the
necklace
keuke
wears
where
yulun
hangs
as
a
and
sansa
as
a
pearl
on
fire
look
upon
me
my
lord
there
was
a
golden
light
in
his
eyes
which
seemed
to
stiffen
the
muscles
and
confuse
his
vision
he
heard
her
voice
again
as
though
very
far
away
it
is
written
that
we
shall
love
my
lord
thou
and
i
this
night
this
night
listen
attentively
i
am
thy
slave
my
lips
shall
touch
thy
feet
look
upon
me
my
lord
there
was
a
dazzling
blindness
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
brain
he
swayed
a
little
still
striving
to
fix
her
with
his
failing
gaze
his
pistol
hand
slipped
sideways
from
his
knee
fell
limply
and
the
weapon
dropped
to
the
thick
carpet
he
could
still
see
the
glimmering
golden
shape
of
her
still
hear
her
distant
voice
it
is
written
that
we
belong
to
god
tokhta
over
his
knees
was
settling
a
sheet
on
it
in
his
lap
lay
a
naked
knife
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
room
save
the
rushing
and
splashing
of
the
scarlet
fish
in
its
crystal
bowl
bending
nearer
the
girl
fixed
her
yellow
eyes
on
the
man
who
looked
back
at
her
with
dying
gaze
sitting
upright
and
knee
deep
in
his
shroud
then
noiselessly
she
uncoiled
her
supple
golden
body
extending
her
right
arm
toward
the
knife
throw
back
thy
head
my
lord
and
stretch
thy
throat
to
the
sweet
edge
she
whispered
caressingly
no
do
not
close
your
eyes
look
upon
me
look
into
my
eyes
i
am
aoula
temple
girl
of
the
baroulass
i
am
mistress
to
the
slayer
of
souls
i
am
a
golden
plaything
to
sanang
noïane
prince
of
the
yezidees
look
upon
me
attentively
my
lord
her
smooth
little
hand
closed
on
the
hilt
the
scarlet
fish
splashed
furiously
in
the
bowl
dislodging
a
blossom
or
two
which
fell
to
the
carpet
and
slowly
faded
into
mist
now
she
grasped
the
knife
and
she
slipped
from
the
bed
to
the
floor
and
stood
before
the
dazed
man
this
is
the
she
said
in
her
silky
voice
behold
this
is
the
appointed
place
of
prayer
gaze
around
you
my
lord
these
are
the
shadows
of
mighty
men
who
come
here
to
see
you
die
in
the
place
of
prayer
cleves
head
had
fallen
back
but
his
eyes
were
open
the
baroulass
girl
took
his
head
in
both
hands
and
turned
it
hither
and
thither
and
his
glazing
eyes
seemed
to
sweep
a
throng
of
shadowy
men
crowding
the
room
and
he
saw
the
bloodless
symmetrical
visage
of
sanang
among
them
and
the
great
red
beard
of
togrul
and
his
stiffening
lips
parted
in
an
uttered
cry
and
sagged
open
flaccid
and
soundless
the
baroulass
sorceress
lifted
the
shroud
from
his
knees
and
spread
it
on
the
carpet
moving
with
leisurely
grace
about
her
business
and
softly
intoning
the
prayers
for
the
dead
then
having
made
her
arrangements
she
took
her
knife
into
her
right
hand
again
and
came
back
to
the
man
and
stood
close
in
front
of
him
bending
near
and
looking
curiously
into
his
dimmed
eyes
ayah
she
said
smilingly
this
is
the
place
of
prayer
and
you
shall
add
your
prayer
to
ours
before
i
use
my
knife
so
i
give
you
back
your
power
of
speech
pronounce
the
name
of
erlik
very
slowly
his
dry
lips
moved
and
his
dry
tongue
trembled
the
word
they
formed
was
tressa
instantly
the
girl
yellow
eyes
grew
incandescent
and
her
lovely
mouth
became
distorted
with
her
left
hand
she
caught
his
chin
forced
his
head
back
exposing
his
throat
and
using
all
her
strength
drew
the
knife
edge
across
it
but
it
was
only
her
clenched
fingers
that
swept
the
taut
throat
clenched
and
empty
fingers
in
which
the
knife
had
vanished
and
when
the
baroulass
girl
saw
that
her
clenched
hand
was
empty
felt
her
own
pointed
nails
cutting
into
the
tender
flesh
of
her
own
palm
she
stared
at
her
fingers
in
sudden
terror
stared
spread
them
shrieked
where
she
stood
and
writhed
there
trembling
and
screaming
as
though
gripped
in
an
invisible
trap
but
she
fell
silent
when
the
door
of
the
room
opened
noiselessly
behind
her
and
it
was
as
though
she
dared
not
turn
her
head
to
face
the
end
of
all
things
which
had
entered
the
room
and
was
drawing
nearer
in
utter
silence
suddenly
she
saw
its
shadow
on
the
wall
and
her
voice
burst
from
her
lips
in
a
last
shuddering
scream
then
the
end
came
slowly
without
a
sound
and
she
sank
at
the
knees
gently
to
a
kneeling
posture
then
backward
extending
her
supple
golden
shape
across
the
shroud
and
lay
there
limp
as
a
dead
snake
tressa
went
to
the
bowl
of
water
and
drew
from
it
every
blossom
the
scarlet
fish
was
now
thrashing
the
water
to
an
iridescent
spume
and
tressa
plunged
in
her
hands
and
seized
it
and
flung
it
out
squirming
and
wheezing
crimson
foam
on
the
shroud
beside
the
golden
girl
of
the
baroulass
then
very
slowly
she
drew
the
shroud
over
the
dying
things
stepped
back
to
the
chair
where
her
husband
lay
unconscious
knelt
down
beside
him
and
took
his
head
on
her
shoulder
gazing
all
the
while
at
the
outline
of
the
dead
girl
under
the
snowy
shroud
after
a
long
while
cleves
stirred
and
opened
his
eyes
presently
he
turned
his
head
sideways
on
her
shoulder
tressa
he
whispered
hush
she
whispered
all
is
well
now
but
she
did
not
move
her
eyes
from
the
shroud
which
now
outlined
the
still
shapes
of
human
figures
john
recklow
she
called
in
a
low
voice
recklow
entered
noiselessly
with
drawn
pistol
she
motioned
to
him
he
bent
and
lifted
the
edge
of
the
shroud
cautiously
a
bushy
red
beard
protruded
togrul
he
exclaimed
but
who
is
this
young
creature
lying
dead
beside
him
then
tressa
caught
the
collar
of
her
tunic
in
her
left
hand
and
flung
back
her
lovely
face
looking
upward
out
of
eyes
like
sapphires
wet
with
rain
in
the
name
of
the
one
and
only
god
she
sobbed
if
there
be
no
resurrection
for
dead
souls
then
i
have
slain
this
night
in
vain
for
what
does
it
profit
a
girl
if
her
soul
be
lost
to
a
lover
and
her
body
be
saved
for
her
husband
she
rose
from
her
knees
the
tears
still
falling
and
went
and
looked
down
at
the
outlined
shapes
beneath
the
shroud
recklow
had
gone
to
the
telephone
to
summon
his
own
men
and
an
ambulance
now
turning
toward
tressa
from
his
chair
god
knows
what
we
do
without
you
cleves
i
believe
this
accounts
for
all
the
yezidees
except
sanang
excepting
prince
sanang
she
said
drearily
then
she
went
slowly
to
where
her
husband
lay
in
his
armchair
and
sank
down
on
the
floor
and
laid
her
cheek
across
his
feet

the
of

struck
the

from

to

john
recklow
and
his
men
hunted
sanang
the
last
of
the
yezidees
and
sanang
clung
like
a
demon
to
the
country
which
he
had
doomed
to
destruction
imbedding
each
claw
again
as
it
was
torn
loose
battling
for
the
supremacy
of
evil
with
all
his
dreadful
psychic
power
striving
still
to
seize

and
slay
the
bodies
and

of
a

million
americans
again
he
scattered
the
uncounted
myriads
of

once
more
the

swept
over

thousands
on

died

now
the

were
fighting
with

this
gruesome
epidemic
which
had
come
into
the
world
from
they

not
where

national

foulness
that

struck
deeper
into

than
any

had
supposed

it
seemed
at
last
as
though
the
red
plague
too
was
about
to
be
stamped
out
along
with
the
black
death
called
influenza
but
only
a
small
group
of
secret
service
men
knew
that
a
resurgence
of
these
horrors
was
inevitable
unless
sanang
the
slayer
of

was
destroyed
and
they
knew
too
that

person
in

could
hope
to
destroy
sanang
the
last
of

that

the
epidemic
suddenly
blazed
up
and
in
these
places
of
death
the
secret
service
men
always
found
a
clew
and
there
they
hunted
sanang
the
yezidee
to
kill
him
without
mercy
where
they
might
find
him
but
they
never
found

slender
dark
young
man
whose
eyes
slanted
a
trifle
in
his
face
who
dressed
fashionably
lived
fastidiously
and
spoke
english
perfectly
in
a
delightfully
modulated
voice
and
to
new
york
thrice
stricken
by
anarchy
by
plague
and
now
by
god
hurried
from
all
parts
of
the
nation
thousands
of
secret
agents
who
had
been
hunting
sanang
in
distant
cities
or
who
had
been
raiding
the
traitorous
and
secret
gatherings
of
his
mental
dupes
agent
who
was
volunteer
agent
james
benton
came
from
boston
with
his
new
bride
who
had
just
arrived
by
way
of
england
a
young
girl
named
yulun
who
landed
swathed
in
sables
and
stretched
out
both
lovely
little
hands
to
benton
the
instant
she
caught
sight
of
him
on
the
pier
whereupon
he
took
the
slim
figure
in
furs
into
his
arms
which
was
interesting
because
they
had
never
before
met
in
the
flesh
so
their
honeymoon
scarce
begun
benton
and
yulun
came
from
boston
in
answer
to
recklow
emergency
call
and
all
the
way
across
from
san
francisco
came
volunteer
agent
otherwise
alek
selden
bringing
with
him
a
girl
named
sansa
whom
he
had
gone
to
the
coast
to
meet
and
whom
he
had
immediately
married
after
she
had
landed
from
the
japanese
steamer
which
also
was
remarkable
because
although
they
recognised
each
other
instantly
and
their
hands
and
lips
clung
as
they
met
neither
had
ever
before
beheld
the
living
body
of
the
other
the
third
man
who
came
to
new
york
at
recklow
summons
was
volunteer
agent
otherwise
victor
cleves
his
young
wife
suffering
from
nervous
shock
after
the
deaths
of
togrul
khan
and
of
the
baroulass
girl
aoula
had
been
convalescing
in
a
private
sanitarium
in
westchester
until
the
summons
came
to
her
husband
from
recklow
she
had
seen
him
only
for
a
few
moments
every
day
but
the
call
to
duty
seemed
to
have
effected
a
miraculous
cure
in
the
slender
girl
who
had
lain
all
day
long
day
after
day
in
her
still
sunny
room
scarcely
unclosing
her
eyes
at
all
save
only
when
her
husband
was
permitted
to
enter
for
the
few
minutes
allowed
them
every
day
the
physician
had
just
left
after
admitting
that
cleves
seemed
to
be
well
enough
to
travel
if
she
insisted
and
she
and
her
maid
had
already
begun
to
pack
when
her
husband
came
into
her
room
she
looked
around
over
her
shoulder
then
rose
from
her
knees
flung
an
armful
of
clothing
into
the
trunk
before
which
she
had
been
kneeling
and
came
across
the
room
to
him
then
she
dismissed
her
maid
from
the
room
and
when
the
girl
had
gone
i
am
well
victor
she
said
in
a
low
voice
why
are
you
troubled
i
ca
bear
to
have
you
drawn
into
this
horrible
affair
once
more
who
else
is
there
to
discover
and
overcome
sanang
she
asked
calmly
he
remained
silent
so
for
a
few
moments
they
stood
confronting
each
other
there
in
the
still
sunny
chamber
husband
and
wife
who
had
never
even
exchanged
the
first
kiss
two
young
creatures
more
vitally
and
intimately
bound
together
than
any
two
on
earth
yet
utterly
separated
body
and
soul
from
each
other
two
solitary
spirits
which
had
never
merged
two
bodies
virginal
and
inviolate
tressa
spoke
first
i
must
go
that
was
our
bargain
the
word
made
him
wince
as
though
it
had
been
a
sudden
blow
then
his
face
flushed
red
bargain
or
no
bargain
he
said
i
do
want
you
to
go
because
afraid
you
can
not
endure
another
shock
like
the
last
one
and
every
time
you
have
thrown
your
own
mind
and
body
between
this
nation
and
destruction
you
have
nearly
died
of
it
and
if
i
die
she
said
in
a
low
voice
what
answer
she
awaited
perhaps
hoped
for
was
not
the
one
he
made
he
said
if
you
die
in
what
you
believe
to
be
your
line
of
duty
then
it
will
be
i
who
have
killed
you
that
would
not
be
true
it
is
you
who
have
saved
me
i
have
not
i
have
done
nothing
except
to
lead
you
into
danger
of
death
since
i
first
met
you
if
you
mean
spiritually
that
also
is
untrue
you
have
saved
yourself
if
that
indeed
were
necessary
you
have
redeemed
yourself
if
it
is
true
you
needed
redemption
which
i
never
believed
oh
she
sighed
swiftly
sanang
surprised
my
soul
when
it
was
free
of
my
body
followed
my
soul
into
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
caught
it
there
all
alone
and
slew
it
his
lips
and
throat
had
gone
dry
as
he
watched
the
pallid
terror
grow
in
her
face
presently
he
recovered
his
voice
you
call
that
yezidee
the
slayer
of
souls
he
said
but
i
tell
you
there
is
no
such
creature
no
such
power
i
suppose
i
i
know
what
you
mean
having
seen
what
we
call
souls
dissociated
from
their
physical
bodies
but
that
this
yezidee
could
do
you
any
spiritual
damage
i
do
not
for
one
instant
believe
the
idea
is
monstrous
i
tell
you
i
i
fought
him
soul
battling
against
soul
she
stammered
breathing
faster
and
irregularly
i
struggled
with
sanang
there
in
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
i
called
on
god
i
called
on
my
two
great
dogs
bars
and
alaga
i
recited
the
fatha
with
all
my
strength
fighting
convulsively
whenever
his
soul
seized
mine
i
cried
out
the
name
of
khidr
begging
for
wisdom
i
called
on
the
ten
imaums
on
ali
the
lion
on
the
blessed
companions
then
i
tore
my
spirit
out
of
the
grasp
of
his
soul
but
there
was
no
escape
no
escape
she
wailed
for
on
every
side
i
saw
the
rampart
of
gog
and
magog
and
the
woods
rang
with
erlik
laughter
the
dissonant
mirth
of
hell
she
began
to
shudder
and
sway
a
little
then
with
an
effort
she
controlled
herself
in
a
measure
there
never
has
been
she
began
again
with
lips
that
quivered
in
spite
of
her
there
never
has
been
one
moment
in
our
married
lives
when
my
soul
dared
forget
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
dared
seek
yours
god
lives
but
so
does
erlik
there
are
angels
but
there
are
as
many
demons
my
soul
is
ashamed
and
very
lonely
very
lonely
but
no
fit
companion
for
yours
her
hands
dropped
listlessly
beside
her
and
her
chin
sank
so
you
believe
that
yezidee
devil
caught
your
soul
when
it
was
wandering
somewhere
out
of
your
body
and
destroyed
it
he
said
she
did
not
answer
did
not
even
lift
her
eyes
until
he
had
stepped
close
to
her
closer
than
he
had
ever
come
then
she
looked
up
at
him
but
closed
her
eyes
as
he
swept
her
into
his
arms
and
crushed
her
face
and
body
against
his
own
now
her
red
lips
were
on
his
now
her
face
and
heart
and
limbs
and
breast
melted
into
his
her
breath
her
pulse
her
strength
flowed
into
his
and
became
part
of
their
single
being
and
single
pulse
and
breath
and
she
felt
their
two
souls
flame
and
fuse
together
and
burn
together
in
one
heavenly
blaze
felt
the
swift
conflagration
mount
overwhelm
and
sweep
her
clean
of
the
last
lingering
taint
felt
her
soul
unafraid
clasp
her
husband
spirit
in
its
white
embrace
clung
to
him
uplifted
out
of
hell
rising
into
the
blinding
light
of
paradise
far
far
away
she
heard
her
own
voice
in
singing
whispers
heard
her
lips
pronounce
ata
ata
allahou
her
blue
eyes
unclosed
through
a
mist
in
which
she
saw
her
face
grew
a
vast
metallic
clamour
in
her
ears
her
husband
kissed
her
long
silently
then
retaining
her
hand
he
turned
and
lifted
the
receiver
from
the
clamouring
telephone
yes
yes
this
is
yes
is
with
me
when
very
well
yes
we
come
at
once
yes
we
can
get
a
train
in
a
few
minutes
all
right
he
took
his
wife
into
his
arms
again
dearest
of
all
in
the
world
he
said
sanang
is
cornered
in
a
row
of
houses
near
the
east
river
and
recklow
has
flung
a
cordon
around
the
entire
block
good
god
i
take
you
there
then
tressa
smiled
drew
his
head
down
looked
into
his
face
till
the
clear
blue
splendour
of
her
gaze
stilled
the
tumult
in
his
brain
i
alone
know
how
to
deal
with
prince
sanang
she
said
quietly
and
if
john
recklow
or
you
or
benton
or
selden
should
kill
him
with
your
pistols
it
would
be
only
his
body
you
slay
not
the
evil
thing
that
would
escape
you
and
return
to
erlik
you
do
this
thing
tressa
yes
i
must
do
it
but
if
our
pistols
can
not
kill
this
sorcerer
how
are
you
going
to
deal
with
him
i
know
how
have
you
the
strength
yes
the
bodily
and
the
spiritual
do
you
know
that
i
am
already
part
of
you
we
shall
be
nearer
still
he
murmured
she
flushed
but
met
his
gaze
yes
we
shall
be
but
one
being
utterly
for
already
our
hearts
and
souls
are
one
and
we
shall
become
of
one
mind
and
one
body
i
am
no
longer
afraid
of
sanang
noïane
no
longer
afraid
to
slay
him
he
asked
quietly
a
blue
light
flashed
in
her
eyes
and
her
face
grew
still
and
white
and
terrible
death
to
the
body
that
is
nothing
my
lord
she
said
in
a
hard
sweet
voice
it
is
written
that
we
belong
to
god
and
that
we
return
to
him
all
living
things
must
die
heart
of
the
world
it
is
only
the
death
of
souls
that
matters
and
it
has
arrived
at
a
time
in
the
history
of
mankind
i
think
when
the
slayer
of
souls
shall
slay
no
more
she
looked
at
him
flushed
withdrew
her
hand
and
went
slowly
across
the
room
to
the
big
bay
window
where
potted
flowers
were
in
bloom
from
a
she
took
a
pinch
of
dry
soil
and
dropped
it
into
the
bosom
of
her
gown
then
facing
the
east
with
lowered
arms
and
palms
turned
outward
there
is
no
god
but
god
she
whispered
the
merciful
the
the
compassionate
the
just
for
it
is
written
that
when
the
heavens
are
rolled
together
like
a
scroll
every
soul
shall
know
what
it
hath
wrought
and
those
souls
that
are
dead
in
jehannum
shall
arise
from
the
dead
and
shall
have
their
day
in
court
nor
shall
erlik
stay
them
till
all
has
been
said
and
on
that
day
the
soul
of
a
girl
that
hath
been
put
to
death
shall
ask
for
what
reason
it
was
slain
thus
it
has
been
written
then
tressa
dropped
to
her
knees
touched
the
carpet
with
her
forehead
straightened
her
lithe
body
and
looking
over
her
shoulder
clapped
her
hands
together
sharply
her
maid
opened
the
door
hasten
with
my
lord
luggage
she
cried
happily
and
still
kneeling
lifted
her
head
to
her
husband
and
laughed
up
into
his
eyes
you
should
call
the
porter
for
we
are
nearly
ready
shall
we
go
to
the
station
in
a
sleigh
oh
wonderful
she
leaped
to
her
feet
extended
her
hand
and
caught
his
horses
for
the
lord
of
the
yiort
she
cried
laughingly
kosh
take
me
out
into
this
new
white
world
that
has
been
born
of
the
ten
purities
and
the
ten
thousand
felicities
it
has
been
made
anew
for
you
and
me
who
also
have
been
born
this
day
he
scarcely
knew
this
sparkling
laughing
girl
with
her
quick
grace
and
her
thousand
swift
little
moods
and
gaieties
porters
came
to
take
his
luggage
from
his
own
room
and
then
her
trunk
and
bags
were
ready
and
were
taken
away
the
baggage
sleigh
drove
off
their
own
jingling
sleigh
followed
and
tressa
buried
in
furs
looked
out
upon
a
dazzling
unblemished
world
lying
silvery
white
under
a
sky
as
azure
as
her
eyes
keuke
mongol
heavenly
azure
he
whispered
close
to
her
crimsoned
cheek
do
you
know
how
i
have
loved
you
always
always
no
i
did
not
know
that
she
said
nor
i
in
the
beginning
yet
it
happened
also
from
the
beginning
when
i
first
saw
you
that
is
a
delicious
thing
to
be
told
within
me
a
most
heavenly
glow
is
spreading
unglove
your
hand
she
slipped
the
glove
from
her
own
white
fingers
and
felt
for
his
under
the
furs
aie
she
sighed
you
are
more
beautiful
than
ali
more
wonderful
than
the
flaming
pearl
out
of
ice
and
fire
a
new
world
has
been
made
for
us
heavenly
azure
my
darling
she
sighed
your
words
are
sweeter
than
the
breeze
in
yian
i
shall
be
a
bride
to
you
such
as
there
never
has
been
since
the
days
of
the
blessed
companions
may
their
names
be
perfumed
and
shall
i
truly
be
one
with
you
my
lord
mind
soul
and
body
one
being
you
and
i
little
heavenly
azure
between
your
two
hands
you
hold
me
like
a
burning
rose
my
lord
your
sweetness
and
fire
penetrate
my
soul
we
shall
burn
together
then
till
the
be
rolled
up
kosh
we
shall
be
one
and
on
that
day
i
shall
not
be
afraid
the
sleigh
came
to
a
clashing
jingling
halt
the
train
plowed
into
the
depot
buried
in
vast
clouds
of
snowy
steam
but
when
they
had
taken
the
places
reserved
for
them
and
the
train
was
moving
swifter
and
more
swiftly
toward
new
york
fear
suddenly
overwhelmed
victor
cleves
and
his
face
grew
grey
with
the
menacing
tumult
of
his
thoughts
the
girl
seemed
to
comprehend
him
too
and
her
own
features
became
still
and
serious
as
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
it
is
in
god
hands
heart
of
the
world
she
said
in
a
low
voice
we
are
one
thou
and
i
or
nearly
so
nothing
can
harm
my
soul
no
but
the
danger
to
your
life
i
fear
no
yezidee
the
beast
will
surely
try
to
kill
you
and
what
can
i
do
you
say
my
pistol
is
useless
yes
but
i
want
you
near
me
do
you
imagine
i
leave
you
for
a
second
good
god
he
added
in
a
strangled
voice
is
there
any
way
i
can
kill
this
wild
beast
with
my
naked
hands
you
must
leave
him
to
me
victor
and
you
believe
you
can
slay
him
you
she
remained
silent
for
a
long
while
bent
forward
in
her
armchair
and
her
hands
clasped
tightly
on
her
knees
my
husband
she
said
at
last
what
your
astronomers
have
but
just
begun
to
suspect
is
true
and
has
long
long
been
known
to
the
for
near
to
this
world
we
live
in
are
other
worlds
planets
that
do
not
reflect
light
and
there
is
a
dark
world
called
yrimid
close
to
the
earth
a
planet
wrapped
in
darkness
a
black
star
and
upon
it
erlik
dwells
and
it
is
peopled
by
demons
and
from
it
comes
sickness
and
evil
she
moistened
her
lips
sat
for
a
while
gazing
vaguely
straight
before
her
from
this
black
planet
comes
all
evil
upon
earth
she
resumed
in
a
hushed
voice
for
it
is
very
near
to
the
earth
it
is
not
a
hundred
miles
away
all
strange
phenomena
for
which
our
scientists
can
not
account
are
due
to
this
invisible
planet
all
new
and
sudden
pestilences
all
convulsions
of
nature
the
newly
noticed
radio
disturbances
the
new
signals
all
all
have
their
hidden
causes
within
that
black
and
planet
long
known
to
the
yezidees
and
by
them
called
yrimid
or
erlik
world
and
it
is
to
this
black
planet
that
i
shall
send
sanang
slayer
of
souls
i
shall
tear
him
from
this
earth
though
he
cling
to
it
with
every
claw
and
i
shall
fling
his
soul
into
darkness
out
across
the
gulf
drive
his
soul
forth
hurl
it
toward
erlik
like
a
swift
rocket
charred
and
falling
from
the
sky
into
endless
night
so
shall
i
strive
to
deal
with
prince
sanang
sorcerer
of
mount
alamout
the
last
of
the
assassins
and
slayer

in
hell
already
their
train
was
rolling
into
the
great
terminal
recklow
was
awaiting
them
he
took
tressa
hands
in
his
and
gazed
earnestly
into
her
face
have
you
come
to
show
us
how
to
conclude
this
murderous
business
he
asked
grimly
i
shall
try
she
said
calmly
where

you
cornered
sanang
could
you
and
victor
come
at
once
yes
she
turned
and
looked
at
her
husband
who
had
become
quite
pale
recklow
saw
the
look
they
exchanged
there
could
be
no
misunderstanding
what
had
happened
to
these
two
their
tragedy
had
ended
they
were
united
at
last
he
understood
it
instantly
realised
how
terrible
was
this
new
and
tragic
situation
for
them
both
yet
he
knew
also
that
the
salvation
of
civilisation
itself
now
depended
upon
this
girl
she
must
face
sanang
there
was
nothing
else
possible
the
streets
are
choked
with
snow
he
said
but
i
have
a
coupé
and
two
strong
horses
waiting
he
nodded
to
one
of
his
men
standing
near
cleves
gave
him
the
hand
luggage
and
checks
all
right
he
said
in
a
low
voice
to
recklow
and
passed
one
arm
through
tressa
the
coupé
was
waiting
on
street
guarded
by
a
policeman
when
they
had
entered
and
were
seated
two
mounted
policemen
rode
ahead
of
the
lurching
vehicle
picking
a
way
amid
the
monstrous
and
headed
for
the
east
river
we
got
him
somewhere
in
a
wretched
row
of
empty
houses
not
far
from
east
river
park
i
taking
you
there
i
drawn
a
cordon
of
my
men
around
the
entire
block
he
ca
get
away
but
i
dared
take
no
chances
with
this
yezidee
sorcerer
dared
not
let
one
of
my
men
go
in
to
look
for
him
go
anywhere
near
him
until
i
could
lay
the
situation
before
you
mrs
cleves
yes
she
said
calmly
it
was
the
only
way
recklow
there
would
have
been
no
use
shooting
him
no
use
taking
him
prisoner
a
prisoner
he
remains
as
deadly
as
ever
dead
his
mind
still
lives
and
breeds
evil
you
are
quite
right
it
is
for
me
to
deal
with
sanang
recklow
shuddered
in
spite
of
himself
can
you
tear
his
claws
from
the
vitals
of
the
world
and
free
the
sick
brains
of
a
million
people
from
the
slavery
of
this
monster
mind
the
girl
said
seriously
even
satan
was
stoned
it
is
so
written
and
was
cast
out
and
dwells
forever
and
ever
in
abaddon
no
star
lights
that
pit
none
lights
the
black
planet
yrimid
it
is
where
evil
dwells
and
there
sanang
noïane
belongs
and
now
beyond
the
dirty
edges
of
the
city
under
an
icy
mist
they
caught
sight
of
the
river
where
ships
lay
blockaded
by
frozen
floes
gulls
circled
over
it
ghostly
factory
chimneys
on
the
further
shore
loomed
up
gigantic
ranged
like
minarettes
the
coupé
jolting
along
behind
the
mounted
policemen
struggled
up
toward
the
sidewalk
and
stopped
the
two
horses
stood
steaming
knee
deep
in
snow
recklow
sprang
out
tressa
gave
him
one
hand
and
stepped
lithely
to
the
sidewalk
then
cleves
got
out
and
came
and
took
hold
of
his
wife
arm
again
well
he
said
harshly
to
recklow
where
is
this
damned
yezidee
hidden
recklow
pointed
in
silence
but
he
and
tressa
had
already
lifted
their
gaze
to
the
stark
shabby
row
of
abandoned
houses
where
every
dirty
blind
was
closed
they
to
be
demolished
and
model
tenements
built
he
said
briefly
a
man
muffled
in
a
fur
overcoat
came
up
and
took
tressa
hand
and
kissed
it
she
smiled
palely
at
benton
spoke
of
yulun
wished
him
happiness
while
she
was
yet
speaking
selden
approached
and
bent
over
her
gloved
hand
she
spoke
to
him
very
sweetly
of
sansa
expressing
pleasure
at
the
prospect
of
seeing
her
again
in
the
body
the
seldens
and
ourselves
have
adjoining
apartments
at
the
ritz
said
benton
we
have
reserved
a
third
suite
for
you
and
victor
she
inclined
her
lovely
head
gravely
then
turned
to
recklow
saying
that
she
was
ready
it
makes
no
difference
which
front
door
i
unlock
he
said
all
these
tenements
are
connected
by
human
and
hidden
runways
leading
from
one
house
to
another
how
many
men
do
you
want
i
want
you
four
men
nobody
else
recklow
led
the
way
up
a
stoop
drew
a
key
from
his
pocket
fitted
it
and
pulled
open
the
door
a
musty
chill
struck
their
faces
as
they
entered
the
darkened
and
empty
hallway
involuntarily
every
man
drew
his
pistol
i
must
ask
you
to
do
exactly
what
i
tell
you
to
do
she
said
calmly
certainly
said
recklow
caressing
his
white
moustache
and
striving
to
pierce
the
gloom
with
his
keen
eyes
then
tressa
took
her
husband
hand
come
she
said
they
mounted
the
stairway
together
and
the
three
others
followed
with
pistols
lifted
there
was
a
vague
grey
light
on
the
second
floor
the
broken
rear
shutters
let
it
in
as
though
she
seemed
to
know
her
way
the
girl
led
them
forward
opened
a
door
in
the
wall
and
disclosed
a
bare
dusty
room
in
the
next
house
through
this
she
stepped
the
others
crept
after
her
with
weapons
ready
she
opened
a
second
door
turned
to
the
four
men
wait
here
for
me
come
only
when
i
call
she
whispered
for
god
sake
take
me
with
you
burst
out
cleves
in
god
name
stay
where
you
are
till
you
hear
me
call
your
name
she
said
almost
breathlessly
then
suddenly
she
turned
swiftly
retracing
her
steps
and
they
saw
her
pass
through
the
first
door
and
disappear
into
the
first
house
they
had
entered
a
terrible
silence
fell
among
them
the
sound
of
her
steps
on
the
bare
boards
had
died
away
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
chilly
dusk
minute
after
minute
dragged
by
one
by
one
the
men
peered
fearfully
at
cleves
his
visage
was
ghastly
and
they
could
see
his
trembling
twice
recklow
looked
at
his
wrist
watch
the
third
time
he
said
unsteadily
she
has
been
gone
of
an
hour
then
far
away
they
heard
a
heavy
tread
on
the
stairs
nearer
and
nearer
came
the
footsteps
every
pistol
was
levelled
at
the
first
door
as
a
man
bulky
form
darkened
it
it
one
of
my
men
said
recklow
in
a
voice
like
a
low
groan
where
on
earth
is
mrs
cleves
i
came
to
tell
you
said
the
agent
cleves
came
out
of
the
first
house
nearly
an
hour
ago
she
got
into
the
coupé
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
ritz
what
gasped
recklow
she
gone
to
the
ritz
repeated
the
agent
no
one
else
has
come
out
and
i
began
to
worry
hearing
nothing
of
you
recklow
so
i
stepped
in
to
see
you
say
that
cleves
went
out
of
the
house
we
entered
got
into
the
coupé
and
told
the
driver
to
go
to
the
ritz
demanded
cleves
astounded
yes
sir
where
is
that
coupé
did
it
return
it
had
not
returned
when
i
came
in
here
go
back
and
look
for
it
look
in
the
other
street
said
recklow
sharply
the
agent
hurried
away
over
the
creaking
boards
the
four
men
gazed
at
one
another
the
thing
to
do
is
to
obey
her
and
stay
where
we
are
said
recklow
grimly
who
knows
what
peril
we
may
cause
her
if
we
move
from
his
words
froze
on
his
lips
as
tressa
voice
rang
out
from
the
darkness
beyond
the
door
they
were
guarding
victor
i
i
i
need
you
come
to
me
my
husband
as
cleves
sprang
through
the
door
into
the
darkness
beyond
benton
smashed
a
window
sash
with
all
the
force
of
his
shoulder
and
reaching
out
through
the
shattered
glass
tore
the
rotting
blinds
from
their
hinges
letting
in
a
flood
of
sickly
light
against
the
bare
wall
stood
tressa
both
arms
extended
her
hands
flat
against
the
plaster
and
each
hand
transfixed
and
pinned
to
the
wall
by
a
knife
a
white
sheet
lay
at
her
feet
on
it
rested
a
third
knife
and
bending
on
one
knee
to
pick
it
up
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
slender
young
man
in
fashionable
afternoon
attire
who
as
they
entered
with
the
crash
of
the
shattered
window
in
their
ears
sprang
to
his
nimble
feet
and
stood
confronting
them
knife
in
hand
instantly
every
man
fired
at
him
and
the
bullets
whipped
the
plaster
to
a
smoke
behind
him
but
the
slender
dark
skinned
young
man
stood
motionless
looking
at
them
out
of
brilliant
eyes
that
slanted
a
trifle
again
the
racket
of
the
fusillade
swept
him
and
filled
the
room
with
plaster
dust
cleves
frantic
with
horror
laid
hold
of
the
knives
that
pinned
his
wife
hands
to
the
wall
and
dragged
them
out
but
there
was
no
blood
no
wound
to
be
seen
on
her
soft
palms
she
took
the
murderous
looking
blades
from
him
threw
one
terrible
look
at
sanang
kicked
the
shroud
across
the
floor
toward
him
and
flung
both
knives
upon
it
the
place
was
still
dim
with
plaster
dust
and
pistol
fumes
as
she
stepped
forward
through
the
acrid
mist
motioning
the
four
men
aside
sanang
she
cried
in
a
clear
voice
may
god
remember
you
in
hell
for
my
feet
have
spurned
your
shroud
and
your
knives
which
could
not
scar
my
palms
shall
never
pierce
my
heart
look
out
for
yourself
prince
sanang
tokhta
he
said
calmly
my
soul
be
ransom
for
yours
that
is
a
lie
my
soul
is
already
ransomed
my
mind
is
the
more
powerful
it
has
already
halted
yours
it
is
conquering
yours
it
is
seizing
your
mind
and
enslaving
it
it
is
mastering
your
will
sanang
your
mind
bends
before
mine
you
know
it
you
know
it
is
bending
you
feel
it
is
breaking
down
sanang
eyes
began
to
glitter
but
his
pale
brown
face
had
grown
almost
white
i
slew
you
once
in
the
wood
of
the
white
moth
he
said
huskily
there
is
no
resurrection
from
such
a
death
little
heavenly
azure
look
upon
me
my
soul
and
yours
are
one
you
are
looking
upon
my
soul
she
said
a
lie
you
are
in
your
body
the
girl
laughed
my
body
lies
asleep
in
the
ritz
upon
my
bed
she
said
my
body
is
his
my
mind
belongs
to
him
my
soul
is
already
one
with
his
do
you
not
know
it
dog
of
a
yezidee
look
upon
me
sanang
noïane
look
upon
my
unwounded
hands
my
shroud
lies
at
your
feet
and
there
lie
the
knives
that
could
not
pierce
my
heart
i
am
thrice
clean
listen
to
my
words
sanang
there
is
no
other
god
but
god
the
young
man
visage
grew
pasty
and
loose
and
horrible
his
lips
became
flaccid
like
dewlaps
but
out
of
these
sagging
folds
of
livid
skin
his
voice
burst
whistling
screaming
as
though
wrenched
from
his
very
belly
may
erlik
strangle
you
may
you
rot
where
you
stand
may
your
face
become
a
writhing
mass
of
maggots
and
your
body
a
corruption
of
living
worms
for
what
you
are
doing
to
me
this
day
may
every
demon
in
hell
torment
you
have
a
care
what
you
are
about
he
screeched
you
are
slaying
my
mind
you
sorceress
you
have
seized
my
mind
and
are
crushing
it
you
are
putting
out
its
light
you
yezidee
witch
you
are
quenching
the
last
spark
of
reason
in
me
sanang
his
knife
fell
clattering
to
the
floor
but
he
stood
stock
still
his
hands
clutching
his
head
stood
motionless
while
scream
on
scream
tore
through
the
loose
and
gaping
lips
blowing
them
into
ghastly
distorted
folds
sanang
noïane
she
cried
in
her
clear
voice
the
eight
towers
are
darkened
the
rampart
of
gog
and
magog
is
fallen
on
mount
alamout
nothing
is
living
the
minds
of
mankind
are
free
again
she
stepped
forward
slowly
and
stood
near
him
chanting
in
a
low
voice
the
prayers
for
the
dead
she
bent
down
and
unrolled
the
shroud
laid
it
on
his
shoulders
and
drew
it
up
and
across
his
face
covering
his
dying
eyes
and
swathed
him
so
slowly
from
head
to
foot
then
she
gathered
up
the
three
knives
cast
them
upward
into
the
air
they
did
not
fall
again
they
disappeared
and
all
the
while
under
her
breath
the
girl
was
chanting
the
prayers
for
the
dead
as
she
moved
silently
about
her
business
shrouded
to
the
forehead
in
its
white
cerements
the
muffled
figure
of
sanang
stood
upright
motionless
as
a
swathed
and
frozen
corpse
outside
the
daylight
had
become
greyer
it
had
begun
to
snow
again
and
a
few
flakes
blew
in
through
the
shattered
windows
and
clung
to
the
winding
sheet
of
sanang
and
now
tressa
drew
close
to
the
shrouded
shape
and
stood
before
it
gazing
intently
upon
the
outlined
features
of
the
last
of
the
yezidees
sanang
she
said
very
softly
i
hear
your
soul
bidding
your
body
farewell
tokhta
then
under
the
strained
gaze
of
the
four
men
gathered
there
the
shroud
fell
to
the
floor
in
a
loose
heap
of
white
folds
there
was
nobody
under
it
no
trace
of
sanang
the
human
shape
of
the
yezidee
had
disappeared
but
a
greyish
mist
had
filled
the
room
wavering
up
like
smoke
from
the
shroud
and
like
smoke
blowing
in
a
long
streamer
toward
the
window
where
the
draught
drew
it
out
through
the
falling
snow
and
scattered
the
last
shred
of
it
against
the
greying
sky
in
the
room
the
mist
thinned
swiftly
the
four
men
could
now
see
one
another
but
tressa
was
no
longer
in
the
room
and
in
place
of
the
white
shroud
a
piece
of
filthy
tattered
carpet
lay
on
the
floor
and
a
dead
rat
flattened
out
dry
and
dusty
lay
upon
it
for
god
sake
whispered
recklow
hoarsely
let
us
get
out
of
this
cleves
his
pistol
clutched
convulsively
stared
at
him
in
terror
but
recklow
took
him
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
away
muttering
that
tressa
was
waiting
for
him
and
might
be
ill
and
that
there
was
nothing
further
to
expect
in
this
ghastly
spot
they
went
with
cleves
to
the
ritz
at
the
desk
the
clerk
said
that
cleves
had
the
keys
and
was
in
her
apartment
the
three
men
entered
the
corridor
with
him
watched
him
try
the
door
saw
him
open
it
lingered
a
moment
after
it
had
closed
heard
the
key
turn
at
the
sound
of
the
door
closing
the
maid
came
madame
is
asleep
in
her
room
she
whispered
when
did
she
come
in
more
than
two
hours
ago
sir
i
have
drawn
her
bath
but
when
i
opened
the
door
a
few
moments
ago
madame
was
still
asleep
he
nodded
he
was
trembling
when
he
put
off
his
overcoat
and
dropped
hat
and
gloves
on
the
carpet
from
the
little
rose
and
ivory
reception
room
he
could
see
the
closed
door
of
his
wife
chamber
and
for
a
while
he
stood
staring
at
it
then
slowly
he
crossed
this
room
opened
the
door
entered
in
her
bedroom
the
tinted
twilight
was
like
ashes
of
roses
he
went
to
the
bed
and
looked
down
at
her
shadowy
face
gazed
intently
listened
then
in
sudden
terror
bent
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
heart
it
was
beating
as
tranquilly
as
a
child
but
as
she
stirred
turned
her
head
and
unclosed
her
eyes
under
his
hand
her
heart
leaped
like
a
wild
thing
caught
unawares
and
the
snowy
skin
glowed
with
an
exquisite
and
deepening
tint
as
she
lifted
her
arms
and
clasped
them
around
her
husband
neck
drawing
his
quivering
face
against
her
own
the
end
