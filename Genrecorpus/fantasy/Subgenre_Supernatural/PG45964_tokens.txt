as
he
got
out
of
the
train
at
the
little
wayside
station
he
remembered
the
conversation
as
if
it
had
been
yesterday
instead
of
fifteen
years
ago
and
his
heart
went
thumping
against
his
ribs
so
violently
that
he
almost
heard
it
the
original
thrill
came
over
him
again
with
all
its
infinite
yearning
he
felt
it
as
he
had
felt
it
not
with
that
tragic
lessening
the
interval
had
brought
to
each
repetition
of
its
memory
here
in
the
familiar
scenery
of
its
birth
he
realised
with
mingled
pain
and
wonder
that
the
subsequent
years
had
not
destroyed
but
only
dimmed
it
the
forgotten
rapture
flamed
back
with
all
the
fierce
beauty
of
its
genesis
desire
at
white
heat
and
the
shock
of
the
abrupt
discovery
shattered
time
fifteen
years
became
a
negligible
moment
the
crowded
experiences
that
had
intervened
seemed
but
a
dream
the
farewell
scene
the
conversation
on
the
steamer
deck
were
clear
as
of
the
day
before
he
saw
the
hand
holding
her
big
hat
that
fluttered
in
the
wind
saw
the
flowers
on
the
dress
where
the
long
coat
was
blown
open
a
moment
recalled
the
face
of
a
hurrying
steward
who
had
jostled
them
he
even
heard
the
voices
his
own
and
hers
yes
she
said
simply
i
promise
you
you
have
my
word
i
wait
till
i
come
back
to
find
you
he
interrupted
steadfastly
she
repeated
his
actual
words
then
added
here
at
home
that
is
i
come
to
the
garden
gate
as
usual
he
told
her
trying
to
smile
i
knock
you
open
the
gate
as
usual
and
come
out
to
me
these
words
too
she
attempted
to
repeat
but
her
voice
failed
her
eyes
filled
suddenly
with
tears
she
looked
into
his
face
and
nodded
it
was
just
then
that
her
little
hand
went
up
to
hold
the
hat
on
he
saw
the
very
gesture
still
he
remembered
that
he
was
vehemently
tempted
to
tear
his
ticket
up
there
and
then
to
go
ashore
with
her
to
stay
in
england
to
brave
all
opposition
when
the
siren
roared
its
third
horrible
warning
and
the
ship
put
out
to
sea
fifteen
years
thick
with
various
incident
had
passed
between
them
since
that
moment
his
life
had
risen
fallen
crashed
then
risen
again
he
had
come
back
at
last
fortune
won
by
a
lucky
coup
at
had
come
back
to
find
her
come
back
above
all
to
keep
his
word
once
every
three
months
they
had
exchanged
the
brief
letter
agreed
upon
i
am
well
i
am
waiting
i
am
happy
i
am
unmarried
yours
for
his
youthful
wisdom
had
insisted
that
no
man
had
the
right
to
keep
any
woman
too
long
waiting
and
she
thinking
that
letter
brave
and
splendid
had
insisted
likewise
that
he
was
free
if
freedom
called
him
they
had
laughed
over
this
last
phrase
in
their
agreement
they
put
five
years
as
the
possible
limit
of
separation
by
then
he
would
have
won
success
and
obstinate
parents
would
have
nothing
more
to
say
but
when
the
five
years
ended
he
was
on
his
uppers
in
a
western
mining
town
and
with
the
end
of
ten
in
sight
those
uppers
though
changed
were
little
better
apparently
than
patched
and
mended
and
it
was
just
then
too
that
the
change
which
had
been
stealing
over
him
betrayed
itself
he
realised
it
abruptly
a
sense
of
shame
and
horror
in
him
the
discovery
was
made
unconsciously
it
disclosed
itself
he
was
reading
her
letter
as
a
labourer
on
a
californian
fruit
farm
funny
she
does
marry
some
one
else
he
heard
himself
say
the
words
were
out
before
he
knew
it
and
certainly
before
he
could
suppress
them
they
just
slipped
out
startling
him
into
the
truth
and
he
knew
instantly
that
the
thought
was
fathered
in
him
by
a
hidden
wish
he
was
older
he
had
lived
it
was
a
memory
he
loved
despising
himself
in
a
contradictory
fashion
both
vaguely
and
fiercely
he
yet
held
true
to
his
boyhood
promise
he
did
not
write
and
offer
to
release
her
as
he
knew
they
did
in
stories
he
persuaded
himself
that
he
meant
to
keep
his
word
there
was
this
fine
stupid
selfish
obstinacy
in
his
character
in
any
case
she
would
misunderstand
and
think
he
wanted
to
set
free
himself
besides
still
awfully
fond
of
her
he
asserted
and
it
was
true
only
the
love
it
seemed
had
gone
its
way
not
that
another
woman
took
it
he
kept
himself
clean
held
firm
as
steel
the
love
apparently
just
faded
of
its
own
accord
her
image
dimmed
her
letters
ceased
to
thrill
then
ceased
to
interest
him
subsequent
reflection
made
him
realise
other
details
about
himself
in
the
interval
he
had
suffered
hardships
had
learned
the
uncertainty
of
life
that
depends
for
its
continuance
on
a
little
food
but
that
food
often
hard
to
come
by
and
had
seen
so
many
others
go
under
that
he
held
it
more
cheaply
than
of
old
the
wandering
instinct
too
had
caught
him
slowly
killing
the
domestic
impulse
he
lost
his
desire
for
a
settled
place
of
abode
the
desire
for
children
of
his
own
lost
the
desire
to
marry
at
all
also
he
reminded
himself
with
a
smile
he
had
lost
other
things
the
expression
of
youth
was
accustomed
to
and
held
always
in
her
thoughts
of
him
two
fingers
of
one
hand
his
hair
he
wore
glasses
too
the
of
life
get
scarred
in
those
wild
places
where
he
lived
he
saw
himself
a
rather
battered
specimen
well
on
the
way
to
middle
age
there
was
confusion
in
his
mind
however
in
his
heart
a
struggling
complex
of
emotions
that
made
it
difficult
to
know
exactly
what
he
did
feel
the
dominant
clue
concealed
itself
feelings
shifted
a
single
clear
determinant
did
not
offer
he
was
an
honest
fellow
i
ca
quite
make
it
out
he
said
what
is
it
i
really
feel
and
why
his
motive
seemed
confused
to
keep
the
flame
alight
for
ten
long
buffeting
years
was
no
small
achievement
better
men
had
succumbed
in
half
the
time
yet
something
in
him
still
held
fast
to
the
girl
as
with
a
band
of
steel
that
not
let
her
go
entirely
occasionally
there
came
strong
reversions
when
he
ached
with
longing
yearning
hope
when
he
loved
her
again
remembered
passionately
each
detail
of
the
courtship
days
in
the
forbidden
rectory
garden
beyond
the
small
white
garden
gate
or
was
it
merely
the
image
and
the
memory
he
loved
again
he
hardly
knew
himself
he
could
not
tell
that
again
puzzled
him
it
was
the
wrong
word
surely
he
still
wrote
the
promised
letter
however
it
was
so
easy
those
short
sentences
could
not
betray
the
dead
or
dying
fires
one
day
besides
he
would
return
and
claim
her
he
meant
to
keep
his
word
and
he
had
kept
it
here
he
was
this
calm
september
afternoon
within
three
miles
of
the
village
where
he
first
had
kissed
her
where
the
marvel
of
first
love
had
come
to
both
three
short
miles
between
him
and
the
little
white
garden
gate
of
which
at
this
very
moment
she
was
intently
thinking
and
behind
which
some
fifty
minutes
later
she
would
be
standing
waiting
for
him
he
had
purposely
left
the
train
at
an
earlier
station
he
would
walk
over
in
the
dusk
climb
the
familiar
steps
knock
at
the
white
gate
in
the
wall
as
of
old
utter
the
promised
words
i
have
come
back
to
find
you
enter
and
keep
his
word
he
had
written
from
mexico
a
week
before
he
sailed
he
had
made
careful
even
accurate
calculations
in
the
dusk
on
the
sixteenth
of
september
i
shall
come
and
knock
he
added
to
the
usual
sentences
the
knowledge
of
his
coming
therefore
had
been
in
her
possession
seven
days
just
before
sailing
moreover
he
had
heard
from
her
though
not
in
answer
naturally
she
was
well
she
was
happy
she
was
unmarried
she
was
waiting
and
now
as
by
some
magical
process
of
restoration
possible
to
deep
hearts
only
perhaps
though
even
by
them
quite
inexplicable
the
state
of
first
love
had
blazed
up
again
in
him
in
all
its
radiant
beauty
it
lit
his
heart
burned
unextinguished
in
his
soul
set
body
and
mind
on
fire
the
years
had
merely
veiled
it
it
burst
upon
him
captured
overwhelmed
him
with
the
suddenness
of
a
dream
he
stepped
from
the
train
he
met
it
in
the
face
it
took
him
prisoner
the
familiar
trees
and
hedges
the
unchanged
countryside
the
known
in
infancy
all
these
with
something
subtly
added
to
them
rolled
back
the
passion
of
his
youth
upon
him
in
a
flood
no
longer
was
he
bound
upon
what
he
deemed
perhaps
an
act
of
honourable
duty
it
was
love
that
drove
him
as
it
drove
him
fifteen
years
before
and
it
drove
him
with
the
accumulated
passion
of
desire
long
forcibly
repressed
almost
as
if
out
of
some
fancied
notion
of
fairness
to
the
girl
he
had
deliberately
yet
still
unconsciously
said
no
to
it
that
had
not
faded
but
that
he
had
decided
must
forget
her
that
sentence
why
does
she
marry
some
one
else
had
not
betrayed
change
in
himself
it
surprised
another
motive
it
not
fair
to
her
his
mind
worked
with
a
curious
rapidity
but
worked
within
one
circle
only
the
stress
of
sudden
emotion
was
extraordinary
he
remembered
a
thousand
things
yet
chief
among
them
those
occasional
reversions
when
he
had
felt
he
loved
her
again
had
he
not
after
all
deceived
himself
had
she
ever
really
faded
at
all
had
he
not
felt
he
ought
to
let
her
fade
release
her
that
way
and
the
change
in
himself
that
sentence
on
the
californian
what
did
they
mean
which
had
been
true
the
fading
or
the
love
the
confusion
in
his
mind
was
hopeless
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
think
at
all
he
only
the
momentum
besides
was
irresistible
and
before
the
shattering
onset
of
the
sweet
revival
he
did
not
stop
to
analyse
the
strange
result
he
knew
certain
things
and
cared
to
know
no
others
that
his
heart
was
leaping
his
blood
running
with
the
heat
of
twenty
that
joy
recaptured
him
that
he
must
see
hear
touch
her
hold
her
in
his
arms
and
marry
her
for
the
fifteen
years
had
crumbled
to
a
little
thing
and
at
he
felt
himself
but
twenty
rapturously
deliciously
in
love
he
went
quickly
eagerly
down
the
little
street
to
the
inn
still
feeling
only
not
thinking
anything
the
vehement
uprush
of
the
old
emotion
made
reflection
of
any
kind
impossible
he
gave
no
further
thought
to
those
long
years
out
there
when
her
name
her
letters
the
very
image
of
her
in
his
mind
had
found
him
if
not
cold
at
least
without
keen
response
all
that
was
forgotten
as
though
it
had
not
been
the
steadfast
thing
in
him
this
strong
holding
to
a
promise
which
had
never
wilted
ousted
the
recollection
of
fading
and
decay
that
whatever
caused
them
certainly
existed
and
this
steadfast
thing
now
took
command
this
enduring
quality
in
his
character
led
him
it
was
only
towards
the
end
of
the
hurried
tea
he
first
received
the
singular
impression
vague
indeed
but
undeniably
persistent
the
strange
impression
that
he
was
led
yet
though
aware
of
this
he
did
not
pause
to
argue
or
reflect
the
emotional
displacement
in
him
of
course
had
been
more
than
considerable
there
had
been
upheaval
a
change
whose
abruptness
was
even
dislocating
fundamental
in
a
sense
he
could
not
estimate
shock
yet
he
took
no
count
of
anything
but
the
one
mastering
desire
to
get
to
her
as
soon
as
possible
knock
at
the
small
white
garden
gate
hear
her
answering
voice
see
the
low
wooden
door
swing
open
take
her
there
was
joy
and
glory
in
his
heart
and
a
yearning
sweet
delight
at
this
very
moment
she
was
expecting
him
and
he
had
come
behind
these
positive
emotions
however
there
lay
concealed
all
the
time
others
that
were
of
a
negative
character
consciously
he
was
not
aware
of
them
but
they
were
there
they
revealed
their
presence
in
various
little
ways
that
puzzled
him
he
recognised
them
absentmindedly
as
it
were
did
not
analyse
or
investigate
them
for
through
the
confusion
upon
his
faculties
rose
also
a
certain
hint
of
insecurity
that
betrayed
itself
by
a
slight
hesitancy
or
miscalculation
in
one
or
two
unimportant
actions
there
was
a
touch
of
melancholy
too
a
sense
of
something
lost
it
lay
perhaps
in
that
tinge
of
sadness
which
accompanies
the
twilight
of
an
autumn
day
when
a
gentler
mournful
beauty
veils
a
greater
beauty
that
is
past
some
trick
of
memory
connected
it
with
a
scene
of
early
boyhood
when
meaning
to
see
the
sunrise
he
overslept
and
by
a
brief
was
just
too
late
he
noted
it
merely
then
passed
on
he
did
not
understand
it
he
hurried
all
the
more
this
hurry
the
only
sign
that
it
noted
i
must
be
quick
flashed
up
across
his
strongly
positive
emotions
and
due
to
this
hurry
possibly
were
the
slight
miscalculations
that
he
made
they
were
very
trivial
he
rang
for
sugar
though
the
bowl
stood
just
before
his
eyes
yet
when
the
girl
came
in
he
forgot
completely
what
he
rang
for
and
inquired
instead
about
the
evening
trains
to
london
and
when
the
was
laid
before
him
he
examined
it
without
intelligence
then
looked
up
suddenly
into
the
maid
face
with
a
question
about
flowers
were
there
flowers
to
be
had
in
the
village
anywhere
what
kind
of
flowers
oh
a
bouquet
or
a
he
hesitated
searching
for
a
word
that
tried
to
present
itself
yet
was
not
the
word
wanted
to
make
use
of
or
a
wreath
of
some
sort
he
finished
he
took
the
very
word
he
did
not
want
to
take
in
several
things
he
did
and
said
this
hesitancy
and
miscalculation
betrayed
themselves
such
trivial
things
yet
significant
in
an
elusive
way
that
he
disliked
there
was
sadness
insecurity
somewhere
in
them
and
he
resented
them
aware
of
their
existence
only
because
they
qualified
his
joy
there
was
a
whispered
no
floating
somewhere
in
the
dusk
almost
he
felt
disquiet
he
hurried
more
and
more
eager
to
be
off
upon
his
journey
the
final
part
of
it
moreover
there
were
other
signs
of
an
odd
miscalculation
dislocation
perhaps
properly
speaking
in
him
though
the
inn
was
familiar
from
his
boyhood
days
kept
by
the
same
old
couple
too
he
volunteered
no
information
about
himself
nor
asked
a
single
question
about
the
village
he
was
bound
for
he
did
not
even
inquire
if
the
rector
her
father
still
were
living
and
when
he
left
he
entirely
neglected
the
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
of
plush
dusty
in
waterless
vases
on
either
side
it
did
not
matter
apparently
whether
he
looked
well
or
ill
tidy
or
untidy
he
forgot
that
when
his
cap
was
off
the
absence
of
thick
accustomed
hair
must
alter
him
considerably
forgot
also
that
two
fingers
were
missing
from
one
hand
the
right
hand
the
hand
that
she
would
presently
clasp
nor
did
it
occur
to
him
that
he
wore
glasses
which
must
change
his
expression
and
add
to
the
appearance
of
the
years
he
bore
none
of
these
obvious
and
natural
things
seemed
to
come
into
his
thoughts
at
all
he
was
in
a
hurry
to
be
off
he
did
not
think
but
though
his
mind
may
not
have
noted
these
slight
betrayals
with
actual
sentences
his
attitude
nevertheless
expressed
them
this
was
it
seemed
the
in
him
what
could
such
details
matter
to
her
why
indeed
should
he
give
to
them
a
single
thought
it
was
himself
she
loved
and
waited
for
not
separate
items
of
his
external
physical
image
as
well
think
of
the
fact
that
she
too
must
have
altered
outwardly
it
never
once
occurred
to
him
such
details
were
of
he
was
only
impatient
to
come
to
her
quickly
very
quickly
instantly
if
possible
he
hurried
there
was
a
flood
of
boyhood
joy
in
him
he
paid
for
his
tea
giving
a
tip
that
was
twice
the
price
of
the
meal
and
set
out
gaily
and
impetuously
along
the
winding
lane
charged
to
the
brim
with
a
sweet
picture
of
a
small
white
garden
gate
the
loved
face
close
behind
it
he
went
forward
at
a
headlong
pace
singing
nancy
lee
as
he
used
to
sing
it
fifteen
years
before
with
action
then
the
negative
sensations
hid
themselves
obliterated
by
the
positive
ones
that
took
command
the
former
however
merely
lay
concealed
they
waited
thus
perhaps
does
vital
emotion
overlong
restrained
denied
indeed
of
its
blossoming
altogether
take
revenge
repressed
elements
in
his
psychic
life
asserted
themselves
selecting
as
though
naturally
a
dramatic
form
the
dusk
fell
rapidly
mist
rose
in
floating
strips
along
the
meadows
by
the
stream
the
old
familiar
details
beckoned
him
forwards
then
drove
him
from
behind
as
he
went
swiftly
past
them
he
recognised
others
rising
through
the
thickening
air
beyond
they
nodded
peered
and
whispered
sometimes
they
almost
sang
and
each
added
to
his
inner
happiness
each
brought
its
sweet
and
precious
contribution
and
built
it
into
the
reconstructed
picture
of
the
earlier
rapture
it
was
an
enticing
and
enchanted
journey
that
he
made
something
impossibly
blissful
in
it
something
too
that
seemed
curiously
inevitable
for
the
scenery
had
not
altered
all
these
years
the
details
of
the
country
were
unchanged
everything
he
saw
was
rich
with
dear
and
precious
association
increasing
the
momentum
of
the
tide
that
carried
him
along
yonder
was
the
stile
over
whose
broken
step
he
had
helped
her
yesterday
and
there
the
slippery
plank
across
the
stream
where
she
looked
above
her
shoulder
to
ask
for
his
support
he
saw
the
very
bramble
bushes
where
she
scratched
her
hand
the
day
before
and
finally
the
signpost
to
the
rectory
it
pointed
to
the
path
through
the
dangerous
field
where
farmer
sparrow
bull
provided
such
a
sweet
excuse
for
holding
leading
protecting
her
from
the
entire
landscape
rose
a
steam
of
recent
memory
each
incident
alive
each
little
detail
brimmed
with
its
cargo
of
fond
association
he
read
the
rough
black
lettering
on
the
crooked
arm
it
was
rather
faded
but
he
knew
it
too
well
to
miss
a
single
letter
and
hurried
forward
along
the
muddy
track
he
looked
about
him
for
a
sign
of
farmer
sparrow
bull
he
even
felt
in
the
misty
air
for
the
little
hand
that
he
might
take
and
lead
her
into
safety
the
thought
of
her
drew
him
on
with
such
irresistible
anticipation
that
it
seemed
as
if
the
cumulative
drive
of
vanished
and
unsated
years
evoked
the
tangible
phantom
almost
he
actually
felt
it
soft
and
warm
and
clinging
in
his
own
that
was
no
longer
incomplete
and
mutilated
yet
it
was
not
he
who
led
and
guided
now
but
more
and
more
he
who
was
being
led
the
hint
had
first
betrayed
its
presence
at
the
inn
it
now
openly
declared
itself
it
had
crossed
the
frontier
into
a
positive
sensation
its
growth
swiftly
increasing
all
this
time
had
accomplished
itself
he
had
ignored
somehow
both
its
genesis
and
quick
development
the
result
he
plainly
recognised
she
was
expecting
him
indeed
but
it
was
more
than
expectation
there
was
calling
in
it
she
summoned
him
her
thought
and
longing
reached
him
along
that
old
invisible
track
love
builds
so
easily
between
true
faithful
hearts
all
the
forces
of
her
being
her
very
voice
came
towards
him
through
the
deepening
autumn
twilight
he
had
not
noticed
the
curious
physical
restoration
in
his
hand
but
he
was
vividly
aware
of
this
more
magical
alteration
that
led
and
guided
him
drawing
him
ever
more
swiftly
towards
the
little
white
garden
gate
where
she
stood
at
this
very
moment
waiting
her
sweet
strength
compelled
him
there
was
this
new
touch
of
something
irresistible
about
the
familiar
journey
where
formerly
had
been
delicious
yielding
only
shy
tentative
advance
he
realised
it
inevitable
his
footsteps
hurried
faster
and
ever
faster
so
deep
was
the
allurement
in
his
blood
he
almost
ran
he
reached
the
narrow
winding
lane
and
raced
along
it
he
knew
each
bend
each
angle
of
the
holly
hedge
each
separate
incident
of
ditch
and
stone
he
could
have
plunged
blindfold
down
it
at
top
speed
the
familiar
perfumes
rushed
at
him
dead
leaves
and
mossy
earth
and
ferns
and
dock
leaves
bringing
the
bewildering
currents
of
strong
emotion
in
him
all
together
as
in
a
rising
wave
he
saw
then
the
crumbling
wall
the
cedars
topping
it
with
spreading
branches
the
chimneys
of
the
rectory
on
his
right
bulked
the
outline
of
the
old
grey
church
the
twisted
ancient
yews
the
company
of
gravestones
upright
and
leaning
dotting
the
ground
like
listening
figures
but
he
looked
at
none
of
these
for
on
his
left
he
already
saw
the
five
rough
steps
of
stone
that
led
from
the
lane
towards
a
small
white
garden
gate
that
gate
at
last
shone
before
him
rising
through
the
misty
air
he
reached
it
he
stopped
dead
a
moment
his
heart
it
seemed
stopped
too
then
took
to
violent
hammering
in
his
brain
there
was
a
roaring
in
his
mind
and
yet
a
marvellous
silence
just
behind
it
then
the
roar
of
emotion
died
away
there
was
utter
stillness
this
stillness
silence
was
all
about
him
the
world
seemed
preternaturally
quiet
but
the
pause
was
too
brief
to
measure
for
the
tide
of
emotion
had
receded
only
to
come
on
again
with
redoubled
power
he
turned
leaped
forward
clambered
impetuously
up
the
rough
stone
steps
and
flung
himself
breathless
and
exhausted
against
the
trivial
barrier
that
stood
between
his
eyes
and
hers
in
his
wild
half
violent
impatience
however
he
stumbled
that
roaring
too
confused
him
he
fell
forward
it
seemed
for
twilight
had
merged
in
darkness
and
he
misjudged
the
steps
the
distances
he
yet
knew
so
well
for
a
moment
certainly
he
lay
at
full
length
upon
the
uneven
ground
against
the
wall
the
steps
had
tripped
him
and
then
he
raised
himself
and
knocked
his
right
hand
struck
upon
the
small
white
garden
gate
upon
the
two
lost
fingers
he
felt
the
impact
i
am
here
he
cried
with
a
deep
sound
in
his
throat
as
though
utterance
was
choked
and
difficult
i
have
come
back
to
find
you
for
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
waited
while
the
world
stood
still
and
waited
with
him
but
there
was
no
delay
her
answer
came
at
once
i
am
well
i
am
happy
i
am
waiting
and
the
voice
was
dear
and
marvellous
as
of
old
though
the
words
were
strange
reminding
him
of
something
dreamed
forgotten
lost
it
seemed
he
did
not
take
special
note
of
them
he
only
wondered
that
she
did
not
open
instantly
that
he
might
see
her
speech
could
follow
but
sight
came
surely
first
there
was
this
of
disappointment
in
him
ah
she
was
lengthening
out
the
marvellous
moment
as
often
and
often
she
had
done
before
it
was
to
tease
him
that
she
made
him
wait
he
knocked
again
he
pushed
against
the
unyielding
surface
for
he
noticed
that
it
was
unyielding
and
there
was
a
depth
in
the
tender
voice
that
he
could
not
understand
open
he
cried
again
but
louder
than
before
i
have
come
back
to
find
you
and
as
he
said
it
the
mist
struck
cold
and
thick
against
his
face
but
her
answer
froze
his
blood
i
can
not
open
and
a
sudden
anguish
of
despair
rose
over
him
the
sound
of
her
voice
was
strange
in
it
was
faintness
distance
as
well
as
depth
it
seemed
to
echo
something
frantic
seized
him
then
the
panic
sense
open
open
come
out
to
me
he
tried
to
shout
his
voice
failed
oddly
there
was
no
power
in
it
something
appalling
struck
him
between
the
eyes
for
god
sake
open
i
waiting
here
open
and
come
out
to
me
the
reply
was
muffled
by
distance
that
already
seemed
increasing
he
was
conscious
of
freezing
cold
about
him
in
his
heart
i
can
not
open
you
must
come
in
to
me
i
here
and
waiting
always
he
knew
not
exactly
then
what
happened
for
the
cold
grew
deeper
and
the
icy
mist
was
in
his
throat
no
words
would
come
he
rose
to
his
knees
and
from
his
knees
to
his
feet
he
stooped
with
all
his
force
he
knocked
again
in
a
blind
frenzy
of
despair
he
hammered
and
beat
against
the
unyielding
barrier
of
the
small
white
garden
gate
he
battered
it
till
the
skin
of
his
knuckles
was
torn
and
bleeding
the
first
two
fingers
of
a
hand
already
mutilated
he
remembers
the
torn
and
broken
skin
for
he
noticed
in
the
gloom
that
stains
upon
the
gate
bore
witness
to
his
violence
it
was
not
till
afterwards
that
he
remembered
the
other
fact
that
the
hand
had
already
suffered
mutilation
long
long
years
ago
the
power
of
sound
was
feebly
in
him
he
called
aloud
there
was
no
answer
he
tried
to
scream
but
the
scream
was
muffled
in
his
throat
before
it
issued
properly
it
was
a
nightmare
scream
as
a
last
resort
he
flung
himself
bodily
upon
the
unyielding
gate
with
such
precipitate
violence
moreover
that
his
face
struck
against
its
surface
from
the
friction
then
along
the
whole
length
of
his
cheek
he
knew
that
the
surface
was
not
smooth
cold
and
rough
that
surface
was
but
also
it
was
not
of
wood
moreover
there
was
writing
on
it
he
had
not
seen
before
how
he
deciphered
it
in
the
gloom
he
never
knew
the
lettering
was
deeply
cut
perhaps
he
traced
it
with
his
fingers
his
right
hand
certainly
lay
stretched
upon
it
he
made
out
a
name
a
date
a
broken
verse
from
the
bible
and
the
words
died
peacefully
the
lettering
was
sharply
cut
with
edges
that
were
new
for
the
date
was
of
a
week
ago
the
broken
verse
ran
when
the
shadows
flee
away
and
the
small
white
garden
gate
was
unyielding
because
it
was
of
stone
at
the
inn
he
found
himself
staring
at
a
table
from
which
the
tea
things
had
not
been
cleared
away
there
was
a
railway
in
his
hands
and
his
head
was
bent
forwards
over
it
trying
to
decipher
the
lettering
in
the
growing
twilight
beside
him
still
fingering
a
shilling
stood
the
her
other
hand
held
a
brown
tray
with
a
running
dog
painted
upon
its
dented
surface
it
swung
to
and
fro
a
little
as
she
spoke
evidently
continuing
a
conversation
her
customer
had
begun
for
she
was
giving
information
in
the
colourless
disinterested
voice
such
persons
use
we
all
went
to
the
funeral
sir
all
the
country
people
went
the
grave
was
her
father
the
family
grave
then
seeing
that
her
customer
was
too
absorbed
in
the
to
listen
further
she
said
no
more
but
began
to
pile
the
tea
things
on
to
the
tray
with
noisy
clatter
ten
minutes
later
in
the
road
he
stood
hesitating
the
signal
at
the
station
just
opposite
was
already
down
the
autumn
mist
was
rising
he
looked
along
the
winding
road
that
melted
away
into
the
distance
then
slowly
turned
and
reached
the
platform
just
as
the
london
train
came
in
he
felt
very
old
too
old
to
walk
six
miles
ii
the
touch
of
pan
an
idiot
heber
understood
was
a
person
in
whom
intelligence
had
been
arrested
instinct
acted
but
not
reason
a
lunatic
on
the
other
hand
was
some
one
whose
reason
had
gone
awry
the
mechanism
of
the
brain
was
injured
the
lunatic
was
out
of
relation
with
his
environment
the
idiot
had
merely
been
delayed
be
that
as
it
might
he
knew
at
any
rate
that
a
lunatic
was
not
to
be
listened
to
whereas
an
idiot
well
the
one
he
fell
in
love
with
certainly
had
the
secret
of
some
instinctual
knowledge
that
was
not
only
joy
but
a
kind
of
sheer
natural
joy
probably
it
was
that
sheer
natural
joy
of
living
that
reason
argues
to
be
untaught
degraded
in
any
case
at
thirty
he
married
her
instead
of
the
daughter
of
a
duchess
he
was
engaged
to
they
lead
that
happy
natural
vagabond
life
called
idiotic
unmindful
of
that
world
the
majority
of
reasonable
people
live
only
to
remember
though
born
into
an
artificial
social
clique
that
made
it
difficult
heber
had
always
loved
the
simple
things
nature
especially
meant
much
to
him
he
would
rather
see
a
woodland
misty
with
bluebells
than
all
the
châteaux
on
the
loire
the
thought
of
a
mountain
valley
in
the
dawn
made
his
feet
lonely
in
the
grandest
houses
yet
in
these
very
houses
was
his
home
established
not
that
he
worldly
things
their
value
was
too
obvious
but
that
it
was
another
thing
he
wanted
only
he
did
not
know
precisely
he
wanted
until
this
particular
idiot
made
it
plain
her
case
was
a
mild
one
possibly
the
title
bestowed
by
implication
rather
than
by
specific
mention
her
family
did
not
say
that
she
was
imbecile
or
but
that
she
was
not
all
there
they
probably
did
say
perhaps
she
saw
men
as
trees
walking
perhaps
she
saw
through
a
glass
darkly
heber
who
had
met
her
once
or
twice
though
never
yet
to
speak
to
did
not
analyse
her
degree
of
sight
for
in
him
personally
she
woke
a
secret
joy
and
wonder
that
almost
involved
a
touch
of
awe
the
part
of
her
that
was
not
all
there
dwelt
in
an
elsewhere
that
he
longed
to
know
about
he
wanted
to
share
it
with
her
she
seemed
aware
of
certain
happy
and
desirable
things
that
reason
and
too
much
thinking
hide
he
just
felt
this
instinctively
without
analysis
the
values
they
set
upon
the
prizes
of
life
were
similar
money
to
her
was
just
stamped
metal
fame
a
loud
noise
of
sorts
position
nothing
of
people
she
was
aware
as
a
dog
or
bird
might
be
aware
they
were
kind
or
unkind
her
parents
having
collected
much
metal
and
achieved
position
proceeded
to
make
a
loud
noise
of
sorts
with
some
success
and
since
she
did
not
contribute
either
by
her
appearance
or
her
tastes
to
their
ambitions
they
neglected
her
and
made
excuses
they
were
ashamed
of
her
existence
her
father
in
particular
justified
nietzsche
shrewd
remark
that
no
one
with
a
loud
voice
can
listen
to
subtle
thoughts
she
was
perhaps
sixteen
for
though
she
looked
it
eighteen
or
nineteen
was
probably
more
in
accord
with
her
birth
certificate
her
mother
was
content
however
that
she
should
dress
the
lesser
age
preferring
to
tell
strangers
that
she
was
childish
rather
than
admit
that
she
was
backward
you
never
marry
at
all
child
much
less
marry
as
you
might
she
said
if
you
go
about
with
that
rabbit
expression
on
your
face
not
the
way
to
catch
a
nice
young
man
of
the
sort
we
get
down
to
stay
with
us
now
many
a
with
less
than
you
got
has
caught
them
easily
enough
your
sister
done
well
why
not
do
the
same
there
nothing
to
be
shy
or
frightened
about
but
i
not
shy
or
frightened
mother
i
bored
i
mean
bore
me
it
made
no
difference
to
the
girl
she
was
herself
the
bored
expression
in
the
eyes
the
rabbit
expression
gave
place
sometimes
to
another
look
yet
not
often
nor
with
anybody
it
was
this
other
look
that
stirred
the
strange
joy
in
the
man
who
fell
in
love
with
her
it
is
not
to
be
easily
described
it
was
very
wonderful
whether
sixteen
or
nineteen
she
then
looked
a
thousand
the
was
of
that
kind
prevalent
in
world
husbands
and
wives
were
not
asked
together
there
was
a
cynical
disregard
of
the
decent
not
the
stupid
conventions
that
savoured
of
abandon
perhaps
of
decadence
he
only
went
himself
in
the
hope
of
seeing
the
backward
daughter
once
again
her
millionaire
parents
afflicted
him
the
smart
folk
tired
him
their
peculiar
affectation
of
a
special
language
their
strange
belief
that
they
were
of
importance
their
treatment
of
the
servants
their
calculated
all
jarred
upon
him
more
than
usual
at
bottom
he
heartily
despised
the
whole
vapid
set
he
felt
uncomfortable
and
out
of
place
though
not
a
prig
he
abhorred
the
way
these
folk
believed
themselves
the
climax
of
fine
living
their
open
immorality
disgusted
him
their
indiscriminate
was
merely
rather
nasty
he
watched
the
very
girl
he
was
at
last
to
settle
down
with
behaving
as
the
tone
of
the
clique
expected
over
her
final
fling
and
bored
by
the
strain
of
so
much
modernity
he
tried
to
get
away
tea
was
long
over
the
sunset
interval
invited
he
felt
hungry
for
trees
and
fields
that
were
not
and
he
escaped
the
flaming
june
day
was
turning
chill
dusk
hovered
over
the
ancient
house
veiling
the
pretentious
new
wing
that
had
been
added
and
he
came
across
the
idiot
girl
at
the
bend
of
the
drive
where
the
birch
trees
shivered
in
the
evening
wind
his
heart
gave
a
leap
she
was
leaning
against
one
of
the
dreadful
statues
it
was
a
satyr
that
sprinkled
the
lawn
her
back
was
to
him
she
gazed
at
a
group
of
broken
pine
trees
in
the
park
beyond
he
paused
an
instant
then
went
on
quickly
while
his
mind
scurried
to
recall
her
name
they
were
within
easy
speaking
range
miss
elizabeth
he
cried
yet
not
too
loudly
lest
she
might
vanish
as
suddenly
as
she
had
appeared
she
turned
at
once
her
eyes
and
lips
were
smiling
welcome
at
him
without
pretence
she
showed
no
surprise
you
the
first
one
of
the
lot
who
said
it
properly
she
exclaimed
as
he
came
up
everybody
calls
me
elizabeth
instead
of
elspeth
it
idiotic
they
do
even
take
the
trouble
to
get
a
name
right
it
is
he
agreed
quite
idiotic
he
did
not
correct
her
possibly
he
had
said
elspeth
after
all
the
names
were
similar
her
perfectly
natural
voice
was
grateful
to
his
ear
and
soothing
he
looked
at
her
all
over
with
an
open
admiration
that
she
noticed
and
without
concealment
liked
she
was
very
untidy
the
grey
stockings
on
her
vigorous
legs
were
torn
her
short
skirt
was
spattered
with
mud
her
hair
glossy
and
plentiful
flew
loose
about
neck
and
shoulders
in
place
of
the
usual
belt
she
had
tied
a
coloured
handkerchief
round
her
waist
she
wore
no
hat
what
she
had
been
doing
to
get
in
such
a
state
while
her
parents
entertained
a
distinguished
party
he
did
not
know
but
it
was
not
difficult
to
guess
climbing
trees
or
riding
bareback
and
astride
was
probably
the
truth
yet
her
dishevelled
state
became
her
well
and
the
welcome
in
her
face
delighted
him
she
remembered
him
she
was
glad
he
too
was
glad
and
a
sense
both
happy
and
reckless
stirred
in
his
heart
like
a
wild
animal
he
said
you
come
out
in
the
dusk
to
play
with
my
kind
she
answered
in
a
flash
throwing
him
a
glance
of
invitation
that
made
his
blood
go
dancing
he
leaned
against
the
statue
a
moment
asking
himself
why
this
young
cinderella
of
a
parvenu
family
delighted
him
when
all
the
london
beauties
left
him
cold
there
was
a
lift
through
his
whole
being
as
he
watched
her
slim
and
supple
grace
shining
through
the
untidy
modern
garb
almost
as
though
she
wore
no
clothes
he
thought
of
a
panther
standing
upright
her
poise
was
so
alert
one
arm
upon
the
marble
ledge
one
leg
bent
across
the
other
the
showing
like
a
bird
curved
wing
wild
animal
or
bird
flashed
across
his
mind
something
untamed
and
natural
another
second
and
she
might
leap
away
or
spring
into
his
arms
it
was
a
deep
stirring
sensation
in
him
that
produced
the
mental
picture
pure
and
natural
a
voice
whispered
with
it
in
his
heart
as
surely
as
are
just
the
other
thing
and
the
thrill
struck
with
unerring
aim
at
the
very
root
of
that
unrest
he
had
always
known
in
the
state
of
life
to
which
he
was
called
she
made
it
natural
clean
and
pure
this
girl
and
himself
were
somehow
kin
the
primitive
thing
broke
loose
in
him
in
two
seconds
while
he
stood
with
her
beside
the
vulgar
statue
these
thoughts
passed
through
his
mind
but
he
did
not
at
first
give
utterance
to
any
of
them
he
spoke
more
formally
although
laughter
due
to
his
happiness
lay
behind
they
have
asked
you
to
the
party
then
or
you
do
care
about
it
which
is
it
both
she
said
looking
fearlessly
into
his
face
but
i
been
here
ten
minutes
already
why
were
you
so
long
this
outspoken
honesty
was
hardly
what
he
expected
yet
in
another
sense
he
was
not
surprised
her
eyes
were
very
penetrating
very
innocent
very
frank
he
felt
her
as
clean
and
sweet
as
some
young
fawn
that
asks
plainly
to
be
stroked
and
fondled
he
told
the
truth
i
could
get
away
before
i
had
to
play
about
and
when
she
interrupted
with
impatience
do
really
want
you
she
exclaimed
scornfully
i
do
and
before
he
could
choose
one
out
of
the
several
answers
that
rushed
into
his
mind
she
nudged
him
with
her
foot
holding
it
out
a
little
so
that
he
saw
the
shoelace
was
unfastened
she
nodded
her
head
towards
it
and
pulled
her
skirt
up
half
an
inch
as
he
at
once
stooped
down
and
anyhow
she
went
on
as
he
fumbled
with
the
lace
touching
her
ankle
with
his
hand
you
going
to
marry
one
of
them
i
read
it
in
the
paper
it
idiotic
you
be
miserable
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
but
whether
owing
to
his
stooping
or
to
something
else
he
could
not
say
i
only
came
i
only
accepted
he
said
quickly
because
i
wanted
to
see
again
of
course
i
made
mother
ask
you
he
did
an
impulsive
thing
kneeling
as
he
was
he
bent
his
head
a
little
lower
and
suddenly
kissed
the
soft
grey
stocking
then
stood
up
and
looked
her
in
the
face
she
was
laughing
happily
no
sign
of
embarrassment
in
her
anywhere
no
trace
of
outraged
modesty
she
just
looked
very
pleased
i
tied
a
knot
that
wo
come
undone
in
a
hurry
he
began
then
stopped
dead
for
as
he
said
it
gazing
into
her
smiling
face
another
expression
looked
forth
at
him
from
the
two
big
eyes
of
hazel
something
rushed
from
his
heart
to
meet
it
it
may
have
been
that
playful
kiss
it
may
have
been
the
way
she
took
it
but
at
any
rate
there
was
a
strength
in
the
new
emotion
that
made
him
unsure
of
who
he
was
and
of
whom
he
looked
at
he
forgot
the
place
the
time
his
own
identity
and
hers
the
lawn
swept
from
beneath
his
feet
the
english
sunset
with
it
he
forgot
his
host
and
hostess
his
fellow
guests
even
his
father
name
and
his
own
into
the
bargain
he
was
carried
away
upon
a
great
tide
the
girl
always
beside
him
he
left
the
in
the
distance
already
half
forgotten
the
of
his
education
learning
manners
social
point
of
view
everything
to
which
his
father
had
most
carefully
brought
him
up
as
the
scion
of
an
english
family
this
girl
had
torn
up
the
anchor
only
the
anchor
had
previously
been
loosened
a
little
by
his
own
unconscious
and
restless
efforts
where
was
she
taking
him
to
upon
what
island
would
they
land
i
younger
than
you
a
good
deal
she
broke
in
upon
his
rushing
mood
but
that
does
matter
a
bit
does
it
we
about
the
same
age
really
with
the
happy
sound
of
her
voice
the
extraordinary
sensation
passed
or
rather
it
became
normal
but
that
it
had
lasted
an
appreciable
time
was
proved
by
the
fact
that
they
had
left
the
statue
on
the
lawn
the
house
was
no
longer
visible
behind
them
and
they
were
walking
side
by
side
between
the
massive
rhododendron
clumps
they
brought
up
against
a
gate
into
the
park
they
leaned
upon
the
topmost
bar
and
he
felt
her
shoulder
touching
his
edging
into
it
as
they
looked
across
to
the
grove
of
pines
i
feel
absurdly
young
he
said
without
a
sign
of
affectation
and
yet
i
been
looking
for
you
a
thousand
years
and
more
the
afterglow
lit
up
her
face
it
fell
on
her
loose
hair
and
tumbled
blouse
turning
them
amber
red
she
looked
not
only
soft
and
comely
but
extraordinarily
beautiful
the
strange
expression
haunted
the
deep
eyes
again
the
lips
were
a
little
parted
the
young
breast
heaving
slightly
joy
and
excitement
in
her
whole
presentment
and
as
he
watched
her
he
knew
that
all
he
had
just
felt
was
due
to
her
close
presence
to
her
atmosphere
her
perfume
her
physical
warmth
and
vigour
it
had
emanated
directly
from
her
being
of
course
she
said
and
laughed
so
that
he
felt
her
breath
upon
his
face
he
bent
lower
to
bring
his
own
on
a
level
gazing
straight
into
her
eyes
that
were
fixed
upon
the
field
beyond
they
were
clear
and
luminous
as
pools
of
water
and
in
their
centre
sharp
as
a
photograph
he
saw
the
reflection
of
the
pine
grove
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
away
with
detailed
accuracy
he
saw
it
empty
and
motionless
in
the
glimmering
june
dusk
then
something
caught
his
eye
he
examined
the
picture
more
closely
he
drew
slightly
nearer
he
almost
touched
her
face
with
his
own
forgetting
for
a
moment
whose
were
the
eyes
that
served
him
for
a
mirror
for
looking
intently
thus
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
a
movement
a
passing
to
and
fro
a
stirring
as
of
figures
among
the
trees
then
suddenly
the
entire
picture
was
obliterated
she
had
dropped
her
lids
he
heard
her
speaking
the
warm
breath
was
again
upon
his
face
in
the
heart
of
that
wood
dwell
i
his
heart
gave
another
leap
more
violent
than
the
first
for
the
wonder
and
beauty
of
the
sentence
caught
him
like
a
spell
there
was
a
lilt
and
rhythm
in
the
words
that
made
it
poetry
she
laid
emphasis
upon
the
pronoun
and
the
nouns
it
seemed
the
last
line
of
some
delicious
runic
verse
in
the
of
the
dwell
and
it
flashed
across
him
that
living
moving
inhabited
pine
wood
was
her
thought
it
was
thus
she
saw
it
her
nature
flung
back
to
a
life
she
understood
a
life
that
needed
claimed
her
the
ostentatious
and
artificial
values
that
surrounded
her
she
denied
even
as
the
distinguished
of
her
ambitious
masquerading
family
neglected
her
of
course
she
was
unnoticed
by
them
just
as
a
swallow
or
a
were
unnoticed
he
knew
her
secret
then
for
she
had
told
it
to
him
it
was
his
own
secret
too
they
were
akin
as
the
birds
and
animals
were
akin
they
belonged
together
in
some
free
and
open
life
natural
wild
untamed
that
unhampered
life
was
flowing
about
them
now
rising
beating
with
delicious
tumult
in
her
veins
and
his
yet
innocent
as
the
sunlight
and
the
wind
because
it
was
as
freely
recognised
elspeth
he
cried
come
take
me
with
you
we
go
at
once
come
hurry
before
we
forget
to
be
happy
or
remember
to
be
wise
again
his
words
stopped
towards
completion
for
a
perfume
floated
past
him
born
of
the
summer
dusk
perhaps
yet
sweet
with
a
penetrating
magic
that
made
his
senses
reel
with
some
remembered
joy
no
flower
no
scented
garden
bush
delivered
it
it
was
the
perfume
of
young
spendthrift
life
sweet
with
the
purity
that
reason
had
not
yet
stained
the
girl
moved
closer
gathering
her
loose
hair
between
her
fingers
she
brushed
his
cheeks
and
eyes
with
it
her
slim
warm
body
pressing
against
him
as
she
leaned
over
laughingly
in
the
darkness
she
whispered
in
his
ear
when
the
moon
puts
the
house
upon
the
statue
and
he
understood
her
world
lay
behind
the
vulgar
staring
day
he
turned
he
heard
the
flutter
of
skirts
just
caught
the
grey
stockings
swift
and
light
as
they
flew
behind
the
rhododendron
masses
and
she
was
gone
he
stood
a
long
time
leaning
upon
that
gate
it
was
the
that
recalled
him
at
length
to
what
seemed
the
present
by
the
conservatory
door
as
he
went
slowly
in
he
met
his
distinguished
cousin
who
was
helping
the
girl
he
himself
was
to
marry
to
enjoy
her
final
fling
he
looked
at
his
cousin
he
realised
suddenly
that
he
was
merely
vicious
there
was
no
sun
and
wind
no
flowers
there
was
depravity
only
lust
instead
of
laughter
excitement
in
place
of
happiness
it
was
calculated
not
spontaneous
his
mind
was
in
it
without
joy
it
was
he
was
not
natural
not
a
girl
in
the
whole
lot
fit
to
look
at
he
exclaimed
with
peevish
boredom
excusing
himself
stupidly
for
his
illicit
conduct
off
in
the
morning
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
these
millionaires
their
shooting
all
right
but
their
bah
his
gesture
completed
all
he
had
to
say
about
this
one
in
particular
he
glanced
sharply
nastily
at
his
companion
look
as
if
you
found
something
he
added
with
a
suggestive
grin
or
have
you
seen
the
ghost
that
was
paid
for
with
the
house
and
he
guffawed
and
let
his
eyeglass
drop
lady
hermione
will
be
asking
for
an
explanation
eh
idiot
replied
heber
and
ran
upstairs
to
dress
for
dinner
but
the
word
was
wrong
he
remembered
as
he
closed
his
door
it
was
lunatic
he
had
meant
to
say
yet
something
more
as
well
he
saw
the
smart
modern
philanderer
somehow
as
a
beast
it
was
nearly
midnight
when
he
went
up
to
bed
after
an
evening
of
intolerable
amusement
the
abandoned
moral
attitude
the
common
rudeness
the
contempt
of
all
others
but
themselves
the
ugly
jests
the
horseplay
of
tasteless
minds
that
passed
for
gaiety
above
all
the
shamelessness
of
the
women
that
behind
the
cover
of
fine
breeding
aped
emancipation
afflicted
him
to
a
boredom
that
touched
desperation
he
understood
now
with
a
clarity
unknown
before
as
with
his
cousin
so
with
these
they
took
life
he
saw
with
a
brazen
effrontery
they
thought
was
freedom
while
yet
it
was
life
that
they
denied
he
felt
vampired
and
degraded
spontaneity
went
out
of
him
the
fact
that
the
geography
of
bedrooms
was
studied
openly
seemed
an
affirmation
of
vice
that
sickened
him
their
ways
were
nauseous
merely
he
escaped
unnoticed
he
locked
his
door
went
to
the
open
window
and
looked
out
into
the
night
then
started
for
silver
dressed
the
lawn
and
park
the
shadow
of
the
building
lay
dark
across
the
elaborate
garden
and
the
moon
he
noticed
was
just
high
enough
to
put
the
house
upon
the
statue
the
edged
the
pedestal
precisely
odd
he
exclaimed
odd
that
i
should
come
at
the
very
moment
then
smiled
as
he
realised
how
his
proposed
adventure
would
be
misinterpreted
its
natural
innocence
and
spirit
ruined
if
he
were
seen
and
some
one
would
be
sure
to
see
me
on
a
night
like
this
there
are
couples
still
hanging
about
in
the
garden
and
he
glanced
at
the
shrubberies
and
secret
paths
that
seemed
to
float
upon
the
warm
june
air
like
islands
he
stood
for
a
moment
framed
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
light
then
turned
back
into
the
room
and
at
that
instant
a
low
sound
like
a
rose
from
the
lawn
below
it
was
soft
and
flutey
as
though
some
one
played
two
notes
upon
a
reed
a
piping
sound
he
had
been
seen
and
she
was
waiting
for
him
before
he
knew
it
he
had
made
an
answering
call
of
oddly
similar
kind
then
switched
the
light
out
three
minutes
later
dressed
in
simpler
clothes
with
a
cap
pulled
over
his
eyes
he
reached
the
back
lawn
by
means
of
the
conservatory
and
the
he
paused
a
moment
to
look
about
him
there
was
no
one
although
the
lights
were
still
ablaze
i
am
an
idiot
he
chuckled
to
himself
i
acting
on
instinct
he
ran
the
sweet
night
air
bathed
him
from
head
to
foot
there
was
strength
and
cleansing
in
it
the
lawn
shone
wet
with
dew
he
could
almost
smell
the
perfume
of
the
stars
the
fumes
of
wine
cigars
and
artificial
scent
were
left
behind
the
atmosphere
exhaled
by
civilisation
by
heavy
thoughts
by
bodies
overdressed
unwisely
stimulated
all
all
forgotten
he
passed
into
a
world
of
magical
enchantment
the
hush
of
the
open
sky
came
down
in
black
and
white
the
garden
lay
brimmed
full
with
beauty
shot
by
the
ancient
silver
of
the
moon
spangled
with
the
stars
and
the
night
wind
rustled
in
the
rhododendron
masses
as
he
flew
between
them
in
a
moment
he
was
beside
the
statue
engulfed
now
by
the
shadow
of
the
building
and
the
girl
detached
herself
silently
from
the
blur
of
darkness
two
arms
were
flung
about
his
neck
a
shower
of
soft
hair
fell
on
his
cheek
with
a
heady
scent
of
earth
and
leaves
and
grass
and
the
same
instant
they
were
away
together
at
full
speed
towards
the
pine
wood
their
feet
were
soundless
on
the
soaking
grass
they
went
so
swiftly
that
they
made
a
whir
of
following
wind
that
blew
her
hair
across
his
eyes
and
the
sudden
contrast
caused
a
shock
that
put
a
blank
perhaps
upon
his
mind
so
that
he
lost
the
standard
of
remembered
things
for
it
was
no
longer
merely
a
particular
adventure
it
seemed
a
habit
and
a
natural
joy
resumed
it
was
not
new
he
knew
the
momentum
of
an
accustomed
happiness
mislaid
it
may
be
but
certainly
familiar
they
sped
across
the
gravel
paths
that
intersected
the
lawn
they
leaped
the
so
laboriously
shaped
in
mockery
they
clambered
over
the
ornamental
iron
railings
scorning
the
easier
gate
into
the
park
the
longer
grass
then
shook
the
dew
in
soaking
showers
against
his
knees
he
stooped
as
though
in
some
foolish
effort
to
turn
up
something
then
realised
that
his
legs
of
course
were
bare
garment
was
already
high
and
free
for
she
too
was
barelegged
like
himself
he
saw
her
little
ankles
wet
and
shining
in
the
moonlight
and
flinging
himself
down
he
kissed
them
happily
plunging
his
face
into
the
dripping
perfumed
grass
her
ringing
laughter
mingled
with
his
own
as
she
stooped
beside
him
the
same
instant
her
hair
hung
in
a
silver
cloud
her
eyes
gleamed
through
its
curtain
into
his
then
suddenly
she
soaked
her
hands
in
the
heavy
dew
and
passed
them
over
his
face
with
a
softness
that
was
like
the
touch
of
some
scented
southern
wind
now
you
are
anointed
with
the
night
she
cried
no
one
will
know
you
you
are
forgotten
of
the
world
kiss
me
we
play
for
ever
and
ever
he
cried
the
eternal
game
that
was
old
when
the
world
was
yet
young
and
lifting
her
in
his
arms
he
kissed
her
eyes
and
lips
there
was
some
natural
bliss
of
song
and
dance
and
laughter
in
his
heart
an
elemental
bliss
that
caught
them
together
as
wind
and
sunlight
catch
the
branches
of
a
tree
she
leaped
from
the
ground
to
meet
his
swinging
arms
he
ran
with
her
then
tossed
her
off
and
caught
her
neatly
as
she
fell
evading
a
second
capture
she
danced
ahead
holding
out
one
shining
arm
that
he
might
follow
hand
in
hand
they
raced
on
together
through
the
clean
summer
moonlight
yet
there
remained
a
smooth
softness
as
of
fur
against
his
neck
and
shoulders
and
he
saw
then
that
she
wore
skins
of
tawny
colour
that
clung
to
her
body
closely
that
he
wore
them
too
and
that
her
skin
like
his
own
was
of
a
sweet
dusky
brown
then
pulling
her
towards
him
he
stared
into
her
face
she
suffered
the
close
gaze
a
second
but
no
longer
for
with
a
burst
of
sparkling
laughter
again
she
leaped
into
his
arms
and
before
he
shook
her
free
she
had
pulled
and
tweaked
the
two
small
horns
that
hid
in
the
thick
curly
hair
behind
and
just
above
the
ears
and
that
wilful
tweaking
turned
him
wild
and
reckless
that
touch
ran
down
him
deep
into
the
mothering
earth
he
leaped
and
ran
and
sang
with
a
great
laughing
sound
the
wine
of
eternal
youth
flushed
all
his
veins
with
joy
and
the
old
old
world
was
young
again
with
every
impulse
of
natural
happiness
intensified
with
the
earth
own
foaming
tide
of
life
from
head
to
foot
he
tingled
with
the
delight
of
spring
prodigal
with
creative
power
of
course
he
could
fly
the
bushes
and
fling
wild
across
the
open
of
course
the
wind
and
moonlight
fitted
close
and
soft
about
him
like
a
skin
of
course
he
had
youth
and
beauty
for
playmates
with
dancing
laughter
singing
and
a
thousand
kisses
for
he
and
she
were
natural
once
again
they
were
free
together
of
those
days
when
pan
leaped
through
the
roses
in
the
month
of
june
with
the
girl
swaying
this
way
and
that
upon
his
shoulders
tweaking
his
horns
with
mischief
and
desire
hanging
her
flying
hair
before
his
eyes
then
bending
swiftly
over
again
to
lift
it
he
danced
to
join
the
rest
of
their
companions
in
the
little
moonlit
grove
of
pines
beyond
they
rose
somewhat
pointed
perhaps
against
the
moonlight
those
english
pines
more
with
the
shape
of
cypresses
some
might
have
thought
a
stream
gushed
down
between
their
roots
there
were
mossy
ferns
and
rough
grey
boulders
with
lichen
on
them
but
there
was
no
dimness
for
the
silver
of
the
moon
sprinkled
freely
through
the
branches
like
the
faint
sunlight
that
it
really
was
and
the
air
ran
out
to
meet
them
with
a
heady
fragrance
that
was
wiser
far
than
wine
the
girl
in
an
instant
was
whirled
from
her
perch
on
his
shoulders
and
caught
by
a
dozen
arms
that
bore
her
into
the
heart
of
the
jolly
careless
throng
whisht
whew
whir
she
was
gone
but
another
fairer
still
was
in
her
place
with
skins
as
soft
and
knees
that
clung
as
tightly
her
eyes
were
liquid
amber
grapes
hung
between
her
little
breasts
her
arms
entwined
about
him
smoother
than
marble
and
as
cool
she
had
a
crystal
laugh
but
he
flung
her
off
so
that
she
fell
plump
among
a
group
of
bigger
figures
lolling
against
a
twisted
root
and
roaring
with
a
jollity
that
boomed
like
wind
through
the
chorus
of
a
song
they
seized
her
kissed
her
then
sent
her
flying
they
were
happier
with
their
glad
singing
they
held
stone
goblets
red
and
foaming
in
their
hands
the
mountains
lie
behind
us
cried
a
figure
dancing
past
we
are
come
at
last
into
our
valley
of
delight
grapes
breasts
and
rich
red
lips
ho
ho
it
is
time
to
press
them
that
the
juice
of
life
may
run
he
waved
a
cluster
of
ferns
across
the
air
and
vanished
amid
a
cloud
of
song
and
laughter
it
is
ours
use
it
answered
a
deep
ringing
voice
the
valleys
are
our
own
no
climbing
now
and
a
wind
of
echoing
cries
gave
answer
from
all
sides
life
life
life
abundant
flowing
over
use
it
use
it
a
troop
of
nymphs
rushed
forth
escaped
from
clustering
arms
and
lips
they
yet
openly
desired
he
chased
them
in
and
out
among
the
waving
branches
while
she
who
had
brought
him
ever
followed
and
sped
past
him
and
away
again
he
caught
three
gleaming
soft
brown
bodies
then
fell
beneath
them
smothered
bubbling
with
joyous
laughter
next
freed
himself
and
while
they
sought
to
drag
him
captive
again
escaped
and
raced
with
a
leap
upon
a
slimmer
sweeter
outline
that
swung
up
only
just
in
time
upon
a
lower
bough
whence
she
leaned
down
above
him
with
hanging
net
of
hair
and
merry
eyes
a
few
feet
beyond
his
reach
she
laughed
and
teased
him
the
one
who
had
brought
him
in
the
one
he
ever
sought
and
who
for
ever
sought
him
too
it
became
a
riotous
glory
of
wild
children
who
romped
and
played
with
an
impassioned
glee
beneath
the
moon
for
the
world
was
young
and
they
her
happy
offspring
glowed
with
the
life
she
poured
so
freely
into
them
all
intermingled
the
laughing
voices
rose
into
a
foam
of
song
that
broke
against
the
stars
the
difficult
mountains
had
been
climbed
and
were
forgotten
good
then
enjoy
the
luxuriant
fruitful
valley
and
be
glad
and
glad
they
were
brimful
with
spontaneous
energy
natural
as
birds
and
animals
that
obeyed
the
big
deep
rhythm
of
a
simpler
age
natural
as
wind
and
innocent
as
sunshine
yet
for
all
the
untamed
riot
there
was
a
lift
of
beauty
pulsing
underneath
even
when
the
wildest
abandon
approached
the
heat
of
orgy
when
the
recklessness
appeared
excess
there
hid
that
marvellous
touch
of
loveliness
which
makes
the
natural
sacred
there
was
coherence
purpose
the
fulfilling
of
an
exquisite
law
there
was
worship
the
form
it
took
haply
was
strange
as
well
as
riotous
yet
in
its
strangeness
dreamed
innocence
and
purity
and
in
its
very
riot
flamed
that
spirit
which
is
divine
for
he
found
himself
at
length
beside
her
once
again
breathless
and
panting
her
sweet
brown
limbs
aglow
from
the
excitement
of
escape
denied
eyes
shining
like
a
blaze
of
stars
and
pulses
beating
with
tumultuous
life
helpless
and
yielding
against
the
strength
that
pinned
her
down
between
the
roots
his
eyes
put
mastery
on
her
own
she
looked
up
into
his
face
obedient
happy
soft
with
love
surrendered
with
the
same
delicious
abandon
that
had
swept
her
for
a
moment
into
other
arms
you
caught
me
in
the
end
she
sighed
i
only
played
awhile
i
hold
you
for
ever
he
replied
half
wondering
at
the
rough
power
in
his
voice
it
was
here
the
hush
of
worship
stole
upon
her
little
face
into
her
obedient
eyes
about
her
parted
lips
she
ceased
her
wilful
struggling
listen
she
whispered
i
hear
a
step
upon
the
glades
beyond
the
iris
and
the
lily
open
the
earth
is
ready
waiting
we
must
be
ready
too
is
coming
he
released
her
and
sprang
up
the
entire
company
rose
too
all
stood
all
bowed
the
head
there
was
an
instant
subtle
panic
but
it
was
the
panic
of
reverent
awe
that
preludes
a
descent
of
deity
for
a
wind
passed
through
the
branches
with
a
sound
that
is
the
oldest
in
the
world
and
so
the
youngest
above
it
there
rose
the
shrill
faint
piping
of
a
little
reed
only
the
first
true
sounds
were
audible
wind
and
water
the
tinkling
of
the
dewdrops
as
they
fell
the
murmur
of
the
trees
against
the
air
this
was
the
piping
that
they
heard
and
in
the
hush
the
stars
bent
down
to
hear
the
riot
paused
the
orgy
passed
and
died
the
figures
waited
kneeling
then
with
one
accord
they
listened
with
the
earth
he
comes
he
comes
the
valley
breathed
about
them
there
was
a
footfall
from
far
away
treading
across
a
world
unruined
and
unstained
it
fell
with
the
wind
and
water
sweetening
the
valley
into
life
as
it
approached
across
the
rivers
and
forests
it
came
gently
tenderly
but
swiftly
and
with
a
power
that
knew
majesty
he
comes
he
comes
rose
with
the
murmur
of
the
wind
and
water
from
the
host
of
lowered
heads
the
footfall
came
nearer
treading
a
world
grown
soft
with
worship
it
reached
the
grove
it
entered
there
was
a
sense
of
intolerable
loveliness
of
brimming
life
of
rapture
the
thousand
faces
lifted
like
a
cloud
they
heard
the
piping
close
and
so
he
came
but
he
came
with
blessing
with
the
stupendous
presence
there
was
joy
the
joy
of
abundant
natural
life
pure
as
the
sunlight
and
the
wind
he
passed
among
them
there
was
great
movement
as
of
a
forest
shaking
as
of
deep
water
falling
as
of
a
cornfield
swaying
to
the
wind
yet
gentle
as
of
a
harebell
shedding
its
burden
of
dew
that
it
has
held
too
long
because
of
love
he
passed
among
them
touching
every
head
the
great
hand
swept
with
tenderness
each
face
lingered
a
moment
on
each
beating
heart
there
was
sweetness
peace
and
loveliness
but
above
all
there
was
life
he
sanctioned
every
natural
joy
in
them
and
blessed
each
passion
with
his
power
of
creation
yet
each
one
saw
him
differently
some
as
a
wife
or
maiden
desired
with
fire
some
as
a
youth
or
stalwart
husband
others
as
a
figure
veiled
with
stars
or
cloaked
in
luminous
mist
hardly
attainable
others
again
the
fewest
these
not
more
than
two
or
three
as
that
mysterious
wonder
which
tempts
the
heart
away
from
known
familiar
sweetness
into
a
wilderness
of
undecipherable
magic
without
flesh
and
blood
to
two
in
particular
he
came
so
near
that
they
could
feel
his
breath
of
hills
and
fields
upon
their
eyes
he
touched
them
with
both
mighty
hands
he
stroked
the
marble
breasts
he
felt
the
little
hidden
horns
and
as
they
bent
lower
so
that
their
lips
met
together
for
an
instant
he
took
her
arms
and
twined
them
about
the
curved
brown
neck
that
she
might
hold
him
closer
still
again
a
footfall
sounded
far
away
upon
an
unruined
world
and
he
was
gone
back
into
the
wind
and
water
whence
he
came
the
thousand
faces
lifted
all
stood
up
the
hush
of
worship
still
among
them
there
was
a
quiet
as
of
the
dawn
the
piping
floated
over
woods
and
fields
fading
into
silence
all
looked
at
one
another
and
then
once
more
the
laughter
and
the
play
broke
loose
we
go
she
cried
and
peep
upon
that
other
world
where
life
hangs
like
a
prison
on
their
eyes
and
in
a
moment
they
were
across
the
soaking
grass
the
lawn
and
and
close
to
the
walls
of
the
heavy
mansion
he
peered
in
through
a
window
lifting
her
up
to
peer
in
with
him
he
recognised
the
world
to
which
outwardly
he
belonged
he
understood
a
little
gasp
escaped
him
and
a
slight
shiver
ran
down
the
girl
body
into
his
own
she
turned
her
eyes
away
see
she
murmured
in
his
ear
it
ugly
it
not
natural
they
feel
guilty
and
ashamed
there
is
no
innocence
she
saw
the
men
it
was
the
women
that
he
saw
chiefly
lolling
ungracefully
with
a
kind
of
boldness
that
asserted
independence
the
women
smoked
their
cigarettes
with
an
air
of
invitation
they
sought
to
conceal
and
yet
showed
plainly
he
saw
his
familiar
world
in
nakedness
their
backs
were
bare
for
all
the
elaborate
clothes
they
wore
they
hung
their
breasts
uncleanly
in
their
eyes
shone
light
that
had
never
known
the
open
sun
hoping
they
were
alluring
and
desirable
they
feigned
a
guilty
ignorance
of
that
hope
they
all
pretended
instead
of
wind
and
dew
upon
their
hair
he
saw
flowers
grown
artificially
to
ape
wild
beauty
tresses
without
lustre
borrowed
from
the
slums
of
city
factories
he
watched
them
manoeuvring
with
the
men
heard
dark
sentences
caught
gestures
half
delivered
whose
meaning
should
just
convey
that
glimpse
of
guilt
they
deemed
to
increase
pleasure
the
women
were
calculating
but
nowhere
glad
the
men
experienced
but
nowhere
joyous
pretended
innocence
lay
cloaked
with
a
veil
of
something
that
whispered
secretly
clandestine
ashamed
yet
with
a
brazen
air
that
laid
mockery
instead
of
sunshine
in
their
smiles
vice
masqueraded
in
the
ugly
shape
of
pleasure
beauty
was
degraded
into
calculated
tricks
they
were
not
natural
they
knew
not
joy
the
forward
ones
the
civilised
she
laughed
in
his
ear
tweaking
his
horns
with
energy
are
the
backward
unclean
he
muttered
recalling
a
catchword
of
the
world
he
gazed
upon
they
were
the
civilised
they
were
refined
and
educated
advanced
generations
of
careful
breeding
mate
cautiously
selecting
mate
laid
the
polish
of
caste
upon
their
hands
and
faces
where
gleamed
ridiculous
untaught
jewels
rings
bracelets
necklaces
hanging
absurdly
from
every
possible
angle
but
they
are
dressed
up
for
fun
he
exclaimed
more
to
himself
than
to
the
girl
in
skins
who
clung
to
his
shoulders
with
her
naked
arms
she
answered
putting
her
brown
hand
in
play
across
his
eyes
only
they
have
forgotten
even
that
and
another
shiver
passed
through
her
into
him
he
turned
and
hid
his
face
against
the
soft
skins
that
touched
his
cheek
he
kissed
her
body
seizing
his
horns
she
pressed
him
to
her
laughing
happily
look
she
whispered
raising
her
head
again
they
coming
out
and
he
saw
that
two
of
them
a
man
and
a
girl
with
an
interchange
of
secret
glances
had
stolen
from
the
room
and
were
already
by
the
door
of
the
conservatory
that
led
into
the
garden
it
was
his
wife
to
be
and
his
distinguished
cousin
oh
pan
she
cried
in
mischief
the
girl
sprang
from
his
arms
and
pointed
we
will
follow
them
we
will
put
natural
life
into
their
little
veins
or
panic
terror
he
answered
catching
the
yellow
panther
skin
and
following
her
swiftly
round
the
building
he
kept
in
the
shadow
though
she
ran
full
into
the
blaze
of
moonlight
but
they
ca
see
us
she
called
looking
over
her
shoulder
a
moment
they
can
only
feel
our
presence
perhaps
and
as
she
danced
across
the
lawn
it
seemed
a
moonbeam
slipped
from
a
sapling
birch
tree
that
the
wind
curved
earthwards
then
tossed
back
against
the
sky
keeping
just
ahead
they
led
the
pair
by
methods
known
instinctively
to
elemental
blood
yet
not
translatable
led
them
towards
the
little
grove
of
waiting
pines
the
night
wind
murmured
in
the
branches
a
bird
woke
into
a
sudden
burst
of
song
these
sounds
were
plainly
audible
but
four
little
pointed
ears
caught
other
wilder
notes
behind
the
wind
and
music
of
the
bird
the
cries
and
ringing
laughter
the
leaping
footsteps
and
the
happy
singing
of
their
merry
kin
within
the
wood
and
the
throng
paused
then
amid
the
revels
to
watch
the
civilised
draw
near
they
presently
reached
the
trees
halted
looked
about
them
hesitated
a
moment
then
with
a
hurried
movement
as
of
shame
and
fear
lest
they
be
caught
entered
the
zone
of
shadow
let
go
in
here
said
the
man
without
music
in
his
voice
it
dry
on
the
pine
needles
and
we
ca
be
seen
he
led
the
way
she
picked
up
her
skirts
and
followed
over
the
strip
of
long
wet
grass
here
a
log
all
ready
for
us
he
added
sat
down
and
drew
her
into
his
arms
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
sit
on
my
knee
it
warmer
for
your
pretty
figure
he
chuckled
evidently
they
were
on
familiar
terms
for
though
she
hesitated
pretending
to
be
coy
there
was
no
real
resistance
in
her
and
she
allowed
the
ungraceful
roughness
but
are
we
safe
are
you
sure
she
asked
between
his
kisses
what
does
it
matter
even
if
we
not
he
replied
establishing
her
more
securely
on
his
knees
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
safer
here
than
in
my
own
house
he
kissed
her
hungrily
by
jove
hermione
but
you
divine
he
cried
passionately
divinely
beautiful
i
love
you
with
every
atom
of
my
being
with
my
soul
yes
dear
i
know
i
mean
i
know
you
do
but
but
what
he
asked
impatiently
those
detectives
he
laughed
yet
it
seemed
to
annoy
him
my
wife
is
a
beast
she
to
have
me
watched
like
that
he
said
quickly
they
everywhere
she
replied
a
sudden
hush
in
her
tone
she
looked
at
the
encircling
trees
a
moment
then
added
bitterly
i
hate
her
simply
her
i
love
you
he
cried
crushing
her
to
him
that
all
that
matters
now
do
let
waste
time
talking
about
the
rest
she
contrived
to
shudder
and
hid
her
face
against
his
coat
while
he
showered
kisses
on
her
neck
and
hair
and
the
solemn
pine
trees
watched
them
the
silvery
moonlight
fell
on
their
faces
the
scent
of
hay
went
floating
past
i
love
you
with
my
very
soul
he
repeated
with
intense
conviction
i
do
anything
give
up
anything
bear
anything
just
to
give
you
a
moment
happiness
i
swear
it
before
god
there
was
a
faint
sound
among
the
trees
behind
them
and
the
girl
sat
up
alert
she
would
have
scrambled
to
her
feet
but
that
he
held
her
tight
what
the
devil
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
in
a
different
tone
his
vexation
plainly
audible
you
as
nervy
as
if
were
being
watched
instead
of
me
she
paused
before
she
answered
her
finger
on
her
lip
then
she
said
slowly
hushing
her
voice
a
little
watched
that
exactly
what
i
did
feel
i
felt
it
ever
since
we
came
into
the
wood
nonsense
hermione
it
too
many
cigarettes
he
drew
her
back
into
his
arms
forcing
her
head
up
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
better
i
suppose
it
is
nonsense
she
said
smiling
it
gone
now
anyhow
he
began
admiring
her
hair
her
dress
her
shoes
her
pretty
ankles
while
she
resisted
in
a
way
that
proved
her
practice
it
not
you
love
she
pouted
yet
drinking
in
his
praise
she
listened
to
his
repeated
assurances
that
he
loved
her
with
his
soul
and
was
prepared
for
any
sacrifice
i
feel
so
safe
with
you
she
murmured
knowing
the
moves
in
the
game
as
well
as
he
did
she
looked
up
guiltily
into
his
face
and
he
looked
down
with
a
passion
that
he
thought
perhaps
was
joy
you
be
married
before
the
summer
out
he
said
and
all
the
thrill
and
excitement
will
be
over
poor
hermione
she
lay
back
in
his
arms
drawing
his
face
down
with
both
hands
and
kissing
him
on
the
lips
you
have
more
of
him
than
you
can
do
with
eh
as
much
as
you
care
about
anyhow
i
shall
be
much
more
free
she
whispered
things
will
be
easier
and
i
got
to
marry
some
one
she
broke
off
with
another
start
there
was
a
sound
again
behind
them
the
man
heard
nothing
the
blood
in
his
temples
pulsed
too
loudly
doubtless
well
what
is
it
this
time
he
asked
sharply
she
was
peering
into
the
wood
where
the
patches
of
dark
shadow
and
moonlit
spaces
made
odd
irregular
patterns
in
the
air
a
low
branch
waved
slightly
in
the
wind
did
you
hear
that
she
asked
nervously
wind
he
replied
annoyed
that
her
change
of
mood
disturbed
his
pleasure
but
something
moved
only
a
branch
we
quite
alone
quite
safe
i
tell
you
and
there
was
a
rasping
sound
in
his
voice
as
he
said
it
do
be
so
imaginative
i
can
take
care
of
you
she
sprang
up
the
moonlight
caught
her
figure
revealing
its
exquisite
young
curves
beneath
the
smother
of
the
costly
clothing
her
hair
had
dropped
a
little
in
the
struggle
the
man
eyed
her
eagerly
making
a
quick
impatient
gesture
towards
her
then
stopped
abruptly
he
saw
the
terror
in
her
eyes
oh
hark
what
that
she
whispered
in
a
startled
voice
she
put
her
finger
up
oh
let
go
back
i
do
like
this
wood
i
frightened
rubbish
he
said
and
tried
to
catch
her
by
the
waist
it
safer
in
the
house
my
room
or
yours
she
broke
off
again
there
it
is
do
you
hear
it
a
footstep
her
face
was
whiter
than
the
moon
i
tell
you
it
the
wind
in
the
branches
he
repeated
gruffly
oh
come
on
we
were
just
getting
jolly
together
there
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
ca
you
believe
me
he
tried
to
pull
her
down
upon
his
knee
again
with
force
his
face
wore
an
unpleasant
expression
that
was
half
leer
half
grin
but
the
girl
stood
away
from
him
she
continued
to
peer
nervously
about
her
she
listened
you
give
me
the
creeps
he
exclaimed
crossly
clawing
at
her
waist
again
with
passionate
eagerness
that
now
betrayed
exasperation
his
disappointment
turned
him
coarse
the
girl
made
a
quick
movement
of
escape
turning
so
as
to
look
in
every
direction
she
gave
a
little
scream
that
a
step
oh
oh
it
close
beside
us
i
heard
it
being
watched
she
cried
in
terror
she
darted
towards
him
then
shrank
back
he
did
not
try
to
touch
her
this
time
moonshine
he
growled
you
spoilt
my
spoilt
our
chance
with
your
silly
nerves
but
she
did
not
hear
him
apparently
she
stood
there
shivering
as
with
sudden
cold
there
i
saw
it
again
i
sure
of
it
something
went
past
me
through
the
air
and
the
man
still
thinking
only
of
his
own
pleasure
frustrated
got
up
heavily
something
like
anger
in
his
eyes
all
right
he
said
testily
if
you
going
to
make
a
fuss
we
better
go
the
house
safer
possibly
as
you
say
you
know
my
room
come
along
even
that
risk
he
would
not
take
he
loved
her
with
his
soul
they
crept
stealthily
out
of
the
wood
the
girl
slightly
in
front
of
him
casting
frightened
backward
glances
afraid
guilty
ashamed
with
an
air
as
though
they
had
been
detected
they
stole
back
towards
the
garden
and
the
house
and
disappeared
from
view
and
a
wind
rose
suddenly
with
a
rushing
sound
poured
through
the
wood
as
though
to
cleanse
it
swept
out
the
artificial
scent
and
trace
of
shame
and
brought
back
again
the
song
the
laughter
and
the
happy
revels
it
roared
across
the
park
it
shook
the
windows
of
the
house
then
sank
away
as
quickly
as
it
came
the
trees
stood
motionless
again
guarding
their
secret
in
the
clean
sweet
moonlight
that
held
the
world
in
dream
until
the
dawn
stole
up
and
sunshine
took
the
earth
with
joy
iii
the
wings
of
horus
binovitch
had
the
bird
in
him
somewhere
in
his
features
certainly
with
his
piercing
eye
and
nose
in
his
movements
with
his
quick
way
of
flitting
hopping
darting
in
the
way
he
perched
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
the
manner
he
pecked
at
his
food
in
his
twittering
voice
as
well
and
above
all
in
his
mind
he
skimmed
all
subjects
and
picked
their
heart
out
neatly
as
a
bird
skims
lawn
or
air
to
snatch
its
prey
he
had
the
view
of
everything
he
loved
birds
and
understood
them
instinctively
could
imitate
their
whistling
notes
with
astonishing
accuracy
their
one
quality
he
had
not
was
poise
and
balance
he
was
a
nervous
little
man
he
was
neurasthenic
and
he
was
in
egypt
by
doctor
orders
such
imaginative
unnecessary
ideas
he
had
such
uncommon
beliefs
the
old
egyptians
he
said
laughingly
yet
with
a
touch
of
solemn
conviction
in
his
manner
were
a
great
people
their
consciousness
was
different
from
ours
the
bird
idea
for
instance
conveyed
a
sense
of
deity
to
them
of
bird
deity
that
is
they
had
sacred
birds
hawks
ibis
and
so
forth
and
worshipped
them
and
he
put
his
tongue
out
as
though
to
say
with
challenge
ha
ha
they
also
worshipped
cats
and
crocodiles
and
cows
grinned
palazov
binovitch
seemed
to
dart
across
the
table
at
his
adversary
his
eyes
flashed
his
nose
pecked
the
air
almost
one
could
imagine
the
beating
of
his
angry
wings
because
everything
alive
he
half
screamed
was
a
symbol
of
some
spiritual
power
to
them
your
mind
is
as
literal
as
a
dictionary
and
as
incoherent
pages
of
ink
without
connected
meaning
verb
always
in
the
infinitive
if
you
were
an
old
egyptian
you
you
he
flashed
and
spluttered
his
tongue
shot
out
again
his
keen
eyes
blazed
you
might
take
all
those
words
and
spin
them
into
a
great
interpretation
of
life
a
cosmic
romance
as
they
did
instead
you
get
the
bitter
dead
taste
of
ink
in
your
mouth
and
spit
it
over
us
like
that
he
made
a
quick
movement
of
his
whole
body
as
a
bird
that
shakes
itself
in
empty
phrases
khilkoff
ordered
another
bottle
of
champagne
while
vera
his
sister
said
half
nervously
let
go
for
a
drive
it
moonlight
there
was
enthusiasm
at
once
another
of
the
party
called
the
head
waiter
and
told
him
to
pack
food
and
drink
in
baskets
it
was
only
eleven
they
would
drive
out
into
the
desert
have
a
meal
at
two
in
the
morning
tell
stories
sing
and
see
the
dawn
it
was
in
one
of
those
cosmopolitan
hotels
in
egypt
which
attract
the
ordinary
tourists
as
well
as
those
who
are
doing
a
cure
and
all
these
russians
were
ill
with
one
thing
or
another
all
were
ordered
out
for
their
health
and
all
were
the
despair
of
their
doctors
they
were
as
unmanageable
as
a
bazaar
and
as
incoherent
excess
and
bed
were
their
routine
they
lived
but
none
of
them
got
better
equally
none
of
them
got
angry
they
talked
in
this
strange
personal
way
without
a
shred
of
malice
or
offence
the
english
french
and
germans
in
the
hotel
watched
them
with
remote
amazement
referring
to
them
as
that
russian
lot
their
energy
was
elemental
they
never
stopped
they
merely
disappeared
when
the
pace
became
too
fast
then
reappeared
again
after
a
day
or
two
and
resumed
their
living
as
before
binovitch
despite
his
neurasthenia
was
the
life
of
the
party
he
was
also
a
special
patient
of
plitzinger
the
famous
psychiatrist
who
took
a
peculiar
interest
in
his
case
it
was
not
surprising
binovitch
was
a
man
of
unusual
ability
and
of
genuine
deep
culture
but
there
was
something
more
about
him
that
stimulated
curiosity
there
was
this
striking
originality
he
said
and
did
surprising
things
i
could
fly
if
i
wanted
to
he
said
once
when
the
airmen
came
to
astonish
the
natives
with
their
biplanes
over
the
desert
but
without
all
that
machinery
and
noise
it
only
a
question
of
believing
and
understanding
show
us
they
cried
let
see
you
fly
he
got
it
he
off
again
one
of
his
impossible
moments
these
occasions
when
binovitch
let
himself
go
always
proved
wildly
entertaining
he
said
monstrously
incredible
things
as
though
he
really
did
believe
them
they
loved
his
madness
for
it
gave
them
new
sensations
it
only
levitation
after
all
this
flying
he
exclaimed
shooting
out
his
tongue
between
the
words
as
his
habit
was
when
excited
and
what
is
levitation
but
a
power
of
the
air
none
of
you
can
hang
an
orange
in
space
for
a
second
with
all
your
scientific
knowledge
but
the
moon
is
always
levitated
perfectly
and
the
stars
think
they
swing
on
wires
what
raised
the
enormous
stones
of
ancient
egypt
really
believe
it
was
sand
and
ropes
and
clumsy
leverage
and
all
our
weary
and
laborious
mechanical
contrivances
bah
it
was
levitation
it
was
the
powers
of
the
air
believe
in
those
powers
and
gravity
becomes
a
mere
nursery
trick
true
where
it
is
but
true
nowhere
else
to
know
the
fourth
dimension
is
to
step
out
of
a
locked
room
and
appear
instantly
on
the
roof
or
in
another
country
altogether
to
know
the
powers
of
the
air
similarly
is
to
annihilate
what
you
call
weight
and
fly
show
us
show
us
they
cried
roaring
with
delighted
laughter
it
a
question
of
belief
he
repeated
his
tongue
appearing
and
disappearing
like
a
pointed
shadow
it
in
the
heart
the
power
of
the
air
gets
into
your
whole
being
why
should
i
show
you
why
should
i
ask
my
deity
to
persuade
your
scoffing
little
minds
by
any
miracle
for
it
is
deity
i
tell
you
and
nothing
else
i
it
follow
one
idea
like
that
as
i
follow
my
bird
idea
follow
it
with
the
impetus
and
undeviating
concentration
of
a
projectile
and
you
arrive
at
power
you
know
deity
the
bird
idea
of
deity
that
is
knew
that
the
old
egyptians
knew
it
oh
show
us
show
us
they
shouted
impatiently
wearied
of
his
get
up
and
fly
levitate
yourself
as
they
did
become
a
star
binovitch
turned
suddenly
very
pale
and
an
odd
light
shone
in
his
keen
brown
eyes
he
rose
slowly
from
the
edge
of
the
chair
where
he
was
perched
something
about
him
changed
there
was
silence
instantly
i
show
you
he
said
calmly
to
their
intense
amazement
not
to
convince
your
disbelief
but
to
prove
it
to
myself
for
the
powers
of
the
air
are
with
me
here
i
believe
and
horus
great
symbol
is
my
patron
god
the
suppressed
energy
in
his
voice
and
manner
was
indescribable
there
was
a
sense
of
lifting
upheaving
power
about
him
he
raised
his
arms
his
face
turned
upward
he
inflated
his
lungs
with
a
deep
long
breath
and
his
voice
broke
into
a
kind
of
singing
cry
half
prayer
half
chant
o
horus
deity
of
wind
feather
my
soul
though
earth
thick
air
to
know
thy
awful
swiftness
the
russian
is
untranslatable
the
phrase
means
give
my
life
wings
he
broke
off
suddenly
he
climbed
lightly
and
swiftly
upon
the
nearest
table
it
was
in
a
deserted
after
a
game
in
which
he
had
lost
more
pounds
than
there
are
days
in
the
year
and
leaped
into
the
air
he
hovered
a
second
spread
his
arms
and
legs
in
space
appeared
to
float
a
moment
then
buckled
rushed
down
and
forward
and
dropped
in
a
heap
upon
the
floor
while
every
one
roared
with
laughter
but
the
laughter
died
out
quickly
for
there
was
something
in
his
wild
performance
that
was
peculiar
and
unusual
it
was
uncanny
not
quite
natural
his
body
had
seemed
as
with
mordkin
and
nijinski
literally
to
hang
upon
the
air
a
moment
for
a
second
he
gave
the
distressing
impression
of
overcoming
gravity
there
was
a
touch
in
it
of
that
faint
horror
which
appals
by
its
very
vagueness
he
picked
himself
up
unhurt
and
his
face
was
as
grave
as
a
portrait
in
the
academy
but
with
a
new
expression
in
it
that
everybody
noticed
with
this
strange
amazement
and
it
was
this
expression
that
extinguished
the
claps
of
laughter
as
wind
that
takes
away
the
sound
of
bells
like
many
ugly
men
he
was
an
inimitable
actor
and
his
facial
repertory
was
endless
and
incredible
but
this
was
neither
acting
nor
clever
manipulation
of
expressive
features
there
was
something
in
his
curious
russian
physiognomy
that
made
the
heart
beat
slower
and
that
was
why
the
laughter
died
away
so
suddenly
you
ought
to
have
flown
farther
cried
some
one
it
expressed
what
all
had
felt
icarus
did
drink
champagne
another
replied
with
a
laugh
but
nobody
laughed
with
him
you
went
too
near
to
vera
said
palazov
and
passion
melted
the
wax
but
his
face
twitched
oddly
as
he
said
it
there
was
something
he
did
not
understand
and
so
heartily
disliked
the
strange
expression
on
the
features
deepened
it
was
arresting
in
a
disagreeable
almost
in
a
horrible
way
the
talk
stopped
dead
all
stared
there
was
a
feeling
of
dismay
in
everybody
heart
yet
unexplained
some
lowered
their
eyes
or
else
looked
stupidly
elsewhere
but
the
women
of
the
party
felt
a
kind
of
fascination
vera
in
particular
could
not
move
her
sight
away
the
joking
reference
to
his
passionate
admiration
for
her
passed
unnoticed
there
was
a
general
and
individual
sense
of
shock
and
a
chorus
of
whispers
rose
instantly
look
at
binovitch
what
happened
to
his
face
he
changed
he
changing
god
why
he
looks
like
a
bird
but
no
one
laughed
instead
they
chose
the
names
of
birds
hawk
eagle
even
owl
the
figure
of
a
man
leaning
against
the
edge
of
the
door
watching
them
closely
they
did
not
notice
he
had
been
passing
down
the
corridor
had
looked
in
unobserved
and
then
had
paused
he
had
seen
the
whole
performance
he
watched
binovitch
narrowly
now
with
calm
discerning
eyes
it
was
dr
plitzinger
the
great
psychiatrist
for
binovitch
had
picked
himself
up
from
the
floor
in
a
way
that
was
oddly
and
precluded
the
least
possibility
of
the
ludicrous
he
looked
neither
foolish
nor
abashed
he
looked
surprised
but
also
he
looked
half
angry
and
half
frightened
as
some
one
had
said
he
ought
to
have
flown
farther
that
was
the
incredible
impression
his
acrobatics
had
produced
incredible
yet
somehow
actual
this
uncanny
idea
prevailed
as
at
a
séance
where
nothing
genuine
is
expected
to
happen
and
something
genuine
after
all
does
happen
there
was
no
pretence
in
this
binovitch
had
flown
and
now
he
stood
there
white
in
the
face
with
terror
and
with
anger
white
he
looked
extraordinary
this
little
neurasthenic
russian
but
he
looked
at
the
same
time
half
terrific
another
thing
not
commonly
experienced
by
men
was
in
him
breaking
out
of
him
affecting
the
minds
of
his
companions
his
mouth
opened
blood
and
fury
shone
in
his
blazing
eyes
his
tongue
shot
out
like
an
though
even
in
that
the
comic
had
no
place
his
arms
were
spread
like
flapping
wings
and
his
voice
rose
dreadfully
he
failed
me
he
failed
me
he
tried
to
bellow
horus
my
deity
my
power
of
the
air
deserted
me
hell
take
him
hell
burn
his
wings
and
blast
his
piercing
sight
hell
scorch
him
into
dust
for
his
false
prophecies
i
curse
him
i
curse
horus
the
voice
that
should
have
roared
across
the
silent
room
emitted
instead
this
scream
the
added
touch
of
sound
the
reality
it
lent
was
ghastly
yet
it
was
marvellously
done
and
acted
the
entire
thing
was
a
bit
of
instantaneous
inspiration
his
voice
his
words
his
gestures
his
whole
wild
appearance
only
here
was
the
reality
that
caused
the
sense
of
shock
the
expression
on
his
altered
features
was
genuine
was
not
assumed
there
was
something
new
and
alien
in
him
something
cold
and
difficult
to
human
life
something
alert
and
swift
and
cruel
of
another
element
than
earth
a
strange
rapacious
grandeur
had
leaped
upon
the
struggling
features
the
face
looked
and
he
came
forward
suddenly
and
sharply
toward
vera
whose
fixed
staring
eyes
had
never
once
ceased
watching
him
with
a
kind
of
anxious
and
devouring
pain
in
them
she
was
both
drawn
and
beaten
back
binovitch
advanced
on
tiptoe
no
doubt
he
still
was
acting
still
pretending
this
mad
nonsense
that
he
worshipped
horus
the
deity
of
forgotten
days
and
that
horus
had
failed
him
in
his
hour
of
need
but
somehow
there
was
just
a
hint
of
too
much
reality
in
the
way
he
moved
and
looked
the
girl
a
little
creature
with
fluffy
golden
hair
opened
her
lips
her
cigarette
fell
to
the
floor
she
shrank
back
she
looked
for
a
moment
like
some
smaller
coloured
bird
trying
to
escape
from
a
great
pursuing
hawk
she
screamed
binovitch
his
arms
wide
his
face
thrust
forward
had
swooped
upon
her
he
leaped
almost
he
caught
her
no
one
could
say
exactly
what
happened
play
become
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
too
real
confuses
the
emotions
the
change
of
key
was
swift
from
fun
to
terror
is
a
dislocating
jolt
upon
the
mind
some
one
it
was
khilkoff
the
brother
upset
a
chair
everybody
spoke
at
once
everybody
stood
up
an
unaccountable
feeling
of
disaster
was
in
the
air
as
with
those
drinkers
quarrels
that
blaze
out
from
nothing
and
end
in
a
and
death
no
one
able
to
explain
clearly
how
it
came
about
it
was
the
silent
watching
figure
in
the
doorway
who
saved
the
situation
before
any
one
had
noticed
his
approach
there
he
was
among
the
group
laughing
talking
applauding
between
binovitch
and
vera
he
was
vigorously
patting
his
patient
on
the
back
and
his
voice
rose
easily
above
the
general
clamour
he
was
a
strong
quiet
personality
even
in
his
laughter
there
was
authority
and
his
laughter
now
was
the
only
sound
in
the
room
as
though
by
his
mere
presence
peace
and
harmony
were
restored
confidence
came
with
him
the
noise
subsided
vera
was
in
her
chair
again
khilkoff
poured
out
a
glass
of
wine
for
the
great
man
the
czar
said
plitzinger
sipping
his
champagne
while
all
stood
up
delighted
with
his
compliment
and
tact
and
to
your
opening
night
with
the
russian
ballet
he
added
quickly
a
second
toast
or
to
your
first
performance
at
the
moscow
théâtre
des
arts
smiling
significantly
he
glanced
at
binovitch
he
clinked
glasses
with
him
their
arms
were
already
linked
but
it
was
palazov
who
noticed
that
the
doctor
fingers
seemed
rather
tight
upon
the
creased
black
coat
all
drank
looking
with
laughter
yet
with
a
touch
of
respect
toward
binovitch
who
stood
there
dwarfed
beside
the
stalwart
austrian
and
suddenly
as
meek
and
subdued
as
any
mole
apparently
the
abrupt
change
of
key
had
taken
his
mind
successfully
off
something
else
of
course
exclaimed
the
little
man
mentioning
the
famous
russian
ballet
the
very
thing
he
exclaimed
for
he
added
looking
with
devouring
eyes
at
vera
he
was
greatly
pleased
he
began
talking
vociferously
about
dancing
and
the
rationale
of
dancing
they
told
him
he
was
an
undiscovered
master
he
was
delighted
he
winked
at
vera
and
touched
her
glass
again
with
his
we
make
our
début
together
he
cried
we
begin
at
covent
garden
in
london
i
design
the
dresses
and
the
posters
hawk
and
the
dove
i
in
dark
grey
and
you
in
blue
and
gold
ah
dancing
you
know
is
sacred
the
little
self
is
lost
absorbed
it
is
ecstasy
it
is
divine
and
dancing
in
air
the
passion
of
the
birds
and
stars
ah
they
are
the
movements
of
the
gods
you
know
deity
that
way
by
living
it
he
went
on
and
on
his
entire
being
had
shifted
with
a
leap
upon
this
new
subject
the
idea
of
realising
divinity
by
dancing
it
absorbed
him
the
party
discussed
it
with
him
as
though
nothing
else
existed
in
the
world
all
sitting
now
and
talking
eagerly
together
vera
took
the
cigarette
he
offered
her
lighting
it
from
his
own
their
fingers
touched
he
was
as
harmless
and
normal
as
a
retired
diplomat
in
a
but
it
was
plitzinger
whose
subtle
manoeuvring
had
accomplished
the
change
so
cleverly
and
it
was
plitzinger
who
presently
suggested
a
game
of
billiards
and
led
him
off
full
now
of
a
fresh
enthusiasm
for
cannons
balls
and
pockets
into
another
room
they
departed
arm
in
arm
laughing
and
talking
together
their
departure
it
seemed
made
no
great
difference
at
first
eyes
watched
him
out
of
sight
then
turned
to
listen
to
baron
minski
who
was
describing
with
gusto
how
he
caught
wolves
alive
for
coursing
purposes
the
speed
and
power
of
the
wolf
he
said
was
impossible
to
realise
the
force
of
their
awful
leap
the
strength
of
their
teeth
which
could
bite
through
metal
he
showed
a
scar
on
his
arm
and
another
on
his
lip
he
was
telling
truth
and
everybody
listened
with
deep
interest
the
narrative
lasted
perhaps
ten
minutes
or
more
when
minski
abruptly
stopped
he
had
come
to
an
end
he
looked
about
him
he
saw
his
glass
and
emptied
it
there
was
a
general
pause
another
subject
did
not
at
once
present
itself
sighs
were
heard
several
fidgeted
fresh
cigarettes
were
lighted
but
there
was
no
sign
of
boredom
for
where
one
or
two
russians
are
gathered
together
there
is
always
life
they
produce
gaiety
and
enthusiasm
as
wind
produces
waves
like
great
children
they
plunge
into
whatever
interest
presents
itself
at
the
moment
there
is
a
kind
of
uncouth
gambolling
in
their
way
of
taking
life
it
seems
as
if
they
are
always
fighting
that
deep
underlying
national
sadness
which
creeps
into
their
very
blood
midnight
then
exclaimed
palazov
abruptly
looking
at
his
watch
and
the
others
fell
instantly
to
talking
about
that
watch
admiring
it
and
asking
questions
for
the
moment
that
very
ordinary
timepiece
became
the
centre
of
observation
palazov
mentioned
the
price
it
never
stops
he
said
proudly
not
even
under
water
he
looked
up
at
everybody
challenging
admiration
and
he
told
how
at
a
country
house
he
made
a
bet
that
he
would
swim
to
a
certain
island
in
the
lake
and
won
the
bet
he
and
a
girl
were
the
winners
but
as
it
was
a
horse
they
had
bet
he
got
nothing
out
of
it
for
himself
giving
the
horse
to
her
it
was
a
genuine
grievance
in
him
one
felt
he
could
have
cried
as
he
spoke
of
it
but
the
watch
went
all
the
time
he
said
delightedly
holding
the
object
in
his
hand
to
show
and
i
was
twelve
minutes
in
the
water
with
my
clothes
on
yet
this
fragmentary
talk
was
nothing
but
pretence
the
sound
of
clicking
was
audible
from
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
there
was
another
pause
the
pause
however
was
intentional
it
was
not
vacuity
of
mind
or
absence
of
ideas
that
caused
it
there
was
another
subject
an
unfinished
subject
that
each
member
of
the
group
was
still
considering
only
no
one
cared
to
begin
about
it
till
at
last
unable
to
resist
the
strain
any
longer
palazov
turned
to
khilkoff
who
was
saying
he
would
take
a
as
the
champagne
was
too
sweet
and
whispered
something
beneath
his
breath
whereupon
khilkoff
forgetting
his
drink
glanced
at
his
sister
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
made
a
curious
grimace
he
all
right
now
his
reply
was
just
audible
he
with
plitzinger
he
cocked
his
head
sidewise
to
indicate
that
the
clicking
of
the
still
was
going
on
the
subject
was
out
all
turned
their
heads
voices
hummed
and
buzzed
questions
were
asked
and
answered
or
half
answered
eyebrows
were
raised
shoulders
shrugged
hands
spread
out
expressively
there
came
into
the
atmosphere
a
feeling
of
presentiment
of
mystery
of
things
half
understood
primitive
buried
instinct
stirred
a
little
the
kind
of
racial
dread
of
vague
emotions
that
might
gain
the
upper
hand
if
encouraged
they
shrank
from
looking
something
in
the
face
while
yet
this
unwelcome
influence
drew
closer
round
them
all
they
discussed
binovitch
and
his
astonishing
performance
pretty
little
vera
listened
with
large
and
troubled
eyes
though
saying
nothing
the
arab
waiter
had
put
out
the
lights
in
the
corridor
and
only
a
solitary
cluster
burned
now
above
their
heads
leaving
their
faces
in
shadow
in
the
distance
the
clicking
of
the
still
continued
it
was
not
play
it
was
real
exclaimed
minski
vehemently
i
can
catch
wolves
he
blurted
but
birds
ugh
and
human
birds
he
was
half
inarticulate
he
had
witnessed
something
he
could
not
understand
and
it
had
touched
instinctive
terror
in
him
it
was
the
way
he
leaped
that
put
the
wolf
first
into
my
mind
only
it
was
not
a
wolf
at
all
the
others
agreed
and
disagreed
it
was
play
at
first
but
it
was
reality
at
the
end
another
whispered
and
it
was
no
animal
he
mimicked
but
a
bird
and
a
bird
of
prey
at
that
vera
thrilled
in
the
russian
woman
hides
that
touch
of
savagery
which
loves
to
be
caught
mastered
swept
helplessly
away
captured
utterly
and
deliciously
by
the
one
strong
enough
to
do
it
thoroughly
she
left
her
chair
and
sat
down
beside
an
older
woman
in
the
party
who
took
her
arm
quietly
at
once
her
little
face
wore
a
perplexed
expression
mournful
yet
somehow
wild
it
was
clear
that
binovitch
was
not
indifferent
to
her
it
become
an
with
him
this
older
woman
said
the
bird
idea
lives
in
his
mind
he
lives
it
in
his
imagination
ever
since
that
time
at
edfu
when
he
pretended
to
worship
the
great
stone
falcons
outside
the
temple
the
horus
figures
he
been
full
of
it
she
stopped
the
way
binovitch
had
behaved
at
edfu
was
better
left
unmentioned
at
the
moment
perhaps
a
slight
shiver
ran
round
the
listening
group
each
one
waiting
for
some
one
else
to
focus
their
emotion
and
so
explain
it
by
saying
the
convincing
thing
only
no
one
ventured
then
vera
abruptly
gave
a
little
jump
hark
she
exclaimed
in
a
staccato
whisper
speaking
for
the
first
time
she
sat
bolt
upright
she
was
listening
hark
she
repeated
there
it
is
again
but
nearer
than
before
it
coming
closer
i
hear
it
she
trembled
her
voice
her
manner
above
all
her
great
staring
eyes
startled
everybody
no
one
spoke
for
several
seconds
all
listened
the
clicking
of
the
had
ceased
the
halls
and
corridors
lay
in
darkness
and
gloom
was
over
the
big
hotel
everybody
was
in
bed
hear
what
asked
the
older
woman
soothingly
yet
with
a
perceptible
quaver
in
her
voice
too
she
was
aware
that
the
girl
arm
shook
upon
her
own
do
you
not
hear
it
too
the
girl
whispered
all
listened
without
speaking
all
watched
her
paling
face
something
wonderful
yet
half
terrible
seemed
in
the
air
about
them
there
was
a
dull
murmur
audible
faint
remote
its
direction
hard
to
tell
it
had
come
suddenly
from
nowhere
they
shivered
that
strange
racial
thrill
again
passed
into
the
group
unwelcome
unexplained
it
was
aboriginal
it
belonged
to
the
unconscious
primitive
mind
half
childish
half
terrifying
do
you
hear
her
brother
asked
angrily
the
irritable
anger
of
nervous
fear
when
he
came
at
me
she
answered
very
low
i
heard
it
first
i
hear
it
now
again
listen
he
coming
and
at
that
minute
out
of
the
dark
mouth
of
the
corridor
emerged
two
human
figures
plitzinger
and
binovitch
their
game
was
over
they
were
going
up
to
bed
they
passed
the
open
door
of
the
but
binovitch
was
being
half
dragged
half
restrained
for
he
was
apparently
attempting
to
run
down
the
passage
with
flying
dancing
leaps
he
bounded
it
was
like
a
huge
bird
trying
to
rise
for
flight
while
his
companion
kept
him
down
by
force
upon
the
earth
as
they
entered
the
strip
of
light
plitzinger
changed
his
own
position
placing
himself
swiftly
between
his
companion
and
the
group
in
the
dark
corner
of
the
room
he
hurried
binovitch
along
as
though
he
sheltered
him
from
view
they
passed
into
the
shadows
down
the
passage
they
disappeared
and
every
one
looked
significantly
questioningly
at
his
neighbour
though
at
first
saying
no
word
it
seemed
that
a
curious
disturbance
of
the
air
had
followed
them
audibly
vera
was
the
first
to
open
her
lips
you
heard
it
she
said
breathlessly
her
face
whiter
than
the
ceiling
damn
exclaimed
her
brother
furiously
it
was
wind
against
the
outside
walls
wind
in
the
desert
the
sand
is
driving
vera
looked
at
him
she
shrank
closer
against
the
side
of
the
older
woman
whose
arm
was
tight
about
her
it
was
wind
she
whispered
simply
she
paused
all
waited
uneasily
for
the
completion
of
her
sentence
they
stared
into
her
face
like
peasants
who
expected
a
miracle
wings
she
whispered
it
was
the
sound
of
enormous
wings
and
at
four
in
the
morning
when
they
all
returned
exhausted
from
their
excursion
into
the
desert
little
binovitch
was
sleeping
soundly
and
peacefully
in
his
bed
they
passed
his
door
on
tiptoe
but
he
did
not
hear
them
he
was
dreaming
his
spirit
was
at
edfu
experiencing
with
that
ancient
deity
who
was
master
of
all
flying
life
those
strange
enjoyments
upon
which
his
own
troubled
human
heart
was
passionately
set
safe
with
that
mighty
falcon
whose
powers
his
lips
had
scorned
a
few
hours
before
his
soul
released
in
vivid
dream
went
sweetly
flying
it
was
amazing
it
was
gorgeous
he
skimmed
the
nile
at
lightning
speed
dashing
down
headlong
from
the
height
of
the
great
pyramid
he
chased
with
faultless
accuracy
a
little
dove
that
sought
vainly
to
hide
from
his
terrific
pursuit
beneath
the
palm
trees
for
what
he
loved
must
worship
where
he
worshipped
and
the
majesty
of
those
tremendous
effigies
had
fired
his
imagination
to
the
creative
point
where
expression
was
imperative
then
suddenly
at
the
very
moment
of
delicious
capture
the
dream
turned
horrible
becoming
awful
with
the
nightmare
touch
the
sky
lost
all
its
blue
and
sunshine
far
far
below
him
the
little
dove
enticed
him
into
nameless
depths
so
that
he
flew
faster
and
faster
yet
never
fast
enough
to
overtake
it
behind
him
came
a
great
thing
down
the
air
black
hovering
with
gigantic
wings
outstretched
it
had
terrific
eyes
and
the
beating
of
its
feathers
stole
his
wind
away
it
followed
him
crowding
space
he
was
aware
of
a
colossal
beak
curved
like
a
scimitar
and
pointed
wickedly
like
a
tooth
of
iron
he
dropped
he
faltered
he
tried
to
scream
through
empty
space
he
fell
caught
by
the
neck
the
huge
spectral
falcon
was
upon
him
the
talons
were
in
his
heart
and
in
sleep
he
remembered
then
that
he
had
cursed
he
recalled
his
reckless
language
the
curse
of
the
ignorant
is
meaningless
that
of
the
worshipper
is
real
this
attack
was
on
his
soul
he
had
invoked
it
he
realised
next
with
a
touch
of
ghastly
horror
that
the
dove
he
chased
was
after
all
the
bait
that
had
lured
him
purposely
to
destruction
and
awoke
with
a
suffocating
terror
upon
him
and
his
entire
body
bathed
in
icy
perspiration
outside
the
open
window
he
heard
a
sound
of
wings
retreating
with
powerful
strokes
into
the
surrounding
darkness
of
the
sky
the
nightmare
made
its
impression
upon
binovitch
impressionable
and
dramatic
temperament
it
aggravated
his
tendencies
he
related
it
next
day
to
mme
de
drühn
the
friend
of
vera
telling
it
with
that
somewhat
boisterous
laughter
some
minds
use
to
disguise
less
kind
emotions
but
he
received
no
encouragement
the
mood
of
the
previous
night
was
not
recoverable
it
was
already
ancient
history
russians
never
make
the
banal
mistake
of
repeating
a
sensation
till
it
is
exhausted
they
hurry
on
to
novelties
life
flashes
and
rushes
with
them
never
standing
still
for
exposure
before
the
cameras
of
their
minds
mme
de
drühn
however
took
the
trouble
to
mention
the
matter
to
plitzinger
for
plitzinger
like
freud
of
vienna
held
that
dreams
revealed
subconscious
tendencies
which
sooner
or
later
must
betray
themselves
in
action
thank
you
for
telling
me
he
smiled
politely
but
i
have
already
heard
it
from
him
he
watched
her
eyes
for
a
moment
really
examining
her
soul
binovitch
you
see
he
continued
apparently
satisfied
with
what
he
saw
i
regard
as
that
rare
phenomenon
a
genius
without
an
outlet
his
spirit
intensely
creative
finds
no
adequate
expression
his
power
of
production
is
enormous
and
prolific
yet
he
accomplishes
nothing
he
paused
an
instant
binovitch
therefore
is
in
danger
of
poisoning
himself
he
looked
steadily
into
her
face
as
a
man
who
weighs
how
much
he
may
confide
now
he
continued
we
can
find
an
outlet
for
him
a
field
wherein
his
bursting
imaginative
genius
can
produce
results
above
all
results
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
man
is
saved
otherwise
he
looked
extraordinarily
impressive
there
is
bound
to
be
sooner
or
later
madness
she
asked
very
quietly
an
explosion
let
us
say
he
replied
gravely
for
instance
take
this
horus
obsession
of
his
quite
wrong
archæologically
though
it
is
it
is
megalomania
of
a
most
unusual
kind
his
passionate
interest
his
love
his
worship
of
birds
wholesome
enough
in
itself
finds
no
satisfying
outlet
a
man
who
loves
birds
neither
keeps
them
in
cages
nor
shoots
them
nor
stuffs
them
what
then
can
he
do
the
commonplace
observes
them
through
glasses
studies
their
habits
then
writes
a
book
about
them
but
a
man
like
binovitch
overflowing
with
this
intense
creative
power
of
mind
and
imagination
is
not
content
with
that
he
wants
to
know
them
from
within
he
wants
to
feel
what
they
feel
to
live
their
life
he
wants
to
them
you
follow
me
not
quite
well
he
seeks
to
be
identified
with
the
object
of
his
sacred
passionate
adoration
all
genius
seeks
to
know
the
thing
itself
from
its
own
point
of
view
it
desires
union
that
tendency
unrecognised
by
himself
perhaps
and
therefore
subconscious
hides
in
his
very
soul
he
paused
a
moment
and
the
sudden
sight
of
those
majestic
figures
at
edfu
that
crystallisation
of
his
in
granite
took
hold
of
this
excess
in
him
so
to
speak
and
is
now
focusing
it
toward
some
definite
act
binovitch
sometimes
feels
himself
a
bird
you
noticed
what
occurred
last
night
she
nodded
a
slight
shiver
passed
over
her
a
most
curious
performance
she
murmured
an
exhibition
i
never
want
to
see
again
the
most
curious
part
replied
the
doctor
coolly
was
its
truth
its
truth
she
exclaimed
beneath
her
breath
she
was
frightened
by
something
in
his
voice
and
by
the
uncommon
gravity
in
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
arrest
her
intelligence
she
felt
upon
the
edge
of
things
beyond
her
you
mean
that
binovitch
did
for
a
moment
hang
in
the
air
the
other
verb
the
right
one
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
use
the
great
man
face
was
enigmatical
he
talked
to
her
sympathy
perhaps
rather
than
to
her
mind
real
genius
he
said
smilingly
is
as
rare
as
talent
even
great
talent
is
common
it
means
that
the
personality
if
only
for
one
second
becomes
everything
becomes
the
universe
becomes
the
soul
of
the
world
it
gets
the
flash
it
is
identified
with
the
universal
life
being
everything
and
everywhere
all
is
possible
to
it
in
that
second
of
vivid
realisation
it
can
brood
with
the
crystal
grow
with
the
plant
leap
with
the
animal
fly
with
the
bird
genius
unifies
all
three
that
is
the
meaning
of
it
is
faith
knowing
it
you
can
pass
through
fire
and
not
be
burned
walk
on
water
and
not
sink
move
a
mountain
fly
because
you
fire
water
earth
air
genius
you
see
is
madness
in
the
magnificent
sense
of
being
superhuman
binovitch
has
it
he
broke
off
abruptly
seeing
he
was
not
understood
some
great
enthusiasm
in
him
he
deliberately
suppressed
the
point
is
he
resumed
speaking
more
carefully
that
we
must
try
to
lead
this
passionate
constructive
genius
of
the
man
into
some
human
channel
that
will
absorb
it
and
therefore
render
it
harmless
he
loves
vera
the
woman
said
bewildered
yet
seizing
this
point
correctly
but
would
he
marry
her
asked
plitzinger
at
once
he
is
already
married
the
doctor
looked
steadily
at
her
a
moment
hesitating
whether
he
should
utter
all
his
thought
in
that
case
he
said
slowly
after
a
pause
it
is
better
he
or
she
should
leave
his
tone
and
manner
were
exceedingly
impressive
you
mean
there
danger
she
asked
i
mean
rather
he
replied
earnestly
that
this
great
creative
flood
in
him
so
curiously
focused
now
upon
his
idea
may
result
in
some
act
of
violence
which
would
be
madness
she
said
looking
hard
at
him
which
would
be
disastrous
he
corrected
her
and
then
he
added
slowly
because
in
the
mental
moment
of
immense
creation
he
might
overlook
material
laws
the
costume
ball
two
nights
later
was
a
great
success
palazov
was
a
bedouin
and
khilkoff
an
apache
mme
de
drühn
wore
a
national
minski
looked
almost
natural
as
don
quixote
and
the
entire
russian
set
was
cleverly
if
somewhat
extravagantly
dressed
but
binovitch
and
vera
were
the
most
successful
of
all
the
two
hundred
dancers
who
took
part
another
figure
a
big
man
dressed
as
a
pierrot
also
claimed
exceptional
attention
for
though
the
costume
was
commonplace
enough
there
was
something
of
dignity
in
his
appearance
that
drew
the
eyes
of
all
upon
him
but
he
wore
a
mask
and
his
identity
was
not
discoverable
it
was
binovitch
and
vera
however
who
must
have
won
the
prize
if
prize
there
had
been
for
they
not
only
looked
their
parts
but
acted
them
as
well
the
former
in
his
dark
grey
feather
tunic
and
his
falcon
mask
complete
even
to
the
brown
hooked
beak
and
tufted
talons
looked
fierce
and
splendid
the
disguise
was
so
admirable
yet
so
entirely
natural
that
it
was
uncommonly
seductive
vera
in
blue
and
gold
a
charming
of
a
dove
upon
her
loosened
hair
and
a
pair
of
little
wings
fluttering
from
her
shoulders
her
tiny
twinkling
feet
and
slender
ankles
well
visible
too
was
equally
successful
and
admired
her
large
and
timid
eyes
her
flitting
movements
her
light
and
dainty
way
of
dancing
all
added
touches
that
made
the
picture
perfect
how
binovitch
contrived
his
dress
remained
a
mystery
for
the
layers
of
wings
upon
his
back
were
real
the
large
black
kites
that
haunt
the
nile
soaring
in
their
hundreds
over
cairo
and
the
bleak
mokattam
hills
had
furnished
them
he
had
procured
them
none
knew
how
they
measured
four
feet
across
from
tip
to
tip
they
swished
and
rustled
as
he
swept
along
they
were
true
falcons
wings
he
danced
with
and
egyptian
princesses
and
rumanian
gipsies
he
danced
well
with
beauty
grace
and
lightness
but
with
vera
he
did
not
dance
at
all
with
her
he
simply
flew
a
kind
of
passionate
abandon
was
in
him
as
he
skimmed
the
floor
with
her
in
a
way
that
made
everybody
turn
to
watch
them
they
seemed
to
leave
the
ground
together
it
was
delightful
an
amazing
sight
but
it
was
peculiar
the
strangeness
of
it
was
on
many
lips
somehow
its
queer
extravagance
communicated
itself
to
the
entire
they
became
the
centre
of
observation
there
were
whispers
there
that
extraordinary
look
he
goes
by
like
a
hawk
and
he
always
after
that
how
marvellously
he
does
it
rather
awful
who
is
he
i
do
envy
people
stood
aside
when
he
rushed
past
they
got
out
of
his
way
he
seemed
forever
pursuing
vera
even
when
dancing
with
another
partner
word
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
a
kind
of
telepathic
interest
was
established
everywhere
it
was
a
shade
too
real
sometimes
something
unduly
earnest
in
the
chasing
wildness
something
unpleasant
there
was
even
alarm
it
rowdy
i
rather
not
see
it
it
quite
disgraceful
was
heard
think
it
horrible
you
can
see
she
terrified
and
once
there
was
a
little
scene
trivial
enough
yet
betraying
this
reality
that
many
noticed
and
disliked
binovitch
came
up
to
claim
a
dance
programme
clutched
in
his
great
tufted
claws
and
at
the
same
moment
the
big
pierrot
appeared
abruptly
round
the
corner
with
a
similar
claim
those
who
saw
it
assert
he
had
been
waiting
and
came
on
purpose
and
that
there
was
something
protective
and
authoritative
in
his
bearing
the
misunderstanding
was
ordinary
enough
both
men
had
written
her
name
against
the
dance
but
no
tango
also
included
the
supper
interval
and
neither
hawk
nor
pierrot
would
give
way
they
were
very
obstinate
both
men
wanted
her
it
was
awkward
the
dove
shall
decide
between
us
smiled
the
hawk
politely
yet
his
taloned
fingers
working
nervously
pierrot
however
more
experienced
in
the
ways
of
dealing
with
women
or
more
bold
said
suavely
i
am
ready
to
abide
by
her
decision
his
voice
poorly
cloaked
this
aggravating
authority
as
though
he
had
the
right
to
her
only
i
engaged
this
dance
before
his
majesty
horus
appeared
upon
the
scene
at
all
and
therefore
it
is
clear
that
pierrot
has
the
right
of
way
at
once
with
a
masterful
air
he
took
her
off
there
was
no
withstanding
him
he
meant
to
have
her
and
he
got
her
she
yielded
meekly
they
vanished
among
the
maze
of
coloured
dancers
leaving
the
hawk
disconsolate
and
vanquished
amid
the
titters
of
the
onlookers
his
swiftness
as
against
this
steady
power
was
of
no
avail
it
was
then
that
the
singular
phenomenon
was
witnessed
first
those
who
saw
it
affirm
that
he
changed
absolutely
into
the
part
he
played
it
was
dreadful
it
was
wicked
a
frightened
whisper
ran
about
the
rooms
and
corridors
an
extraordinary
thing
is
in
the
air
some
shrank
away
while
others
flocked
to
see
there
were
those
who
swore
that
a
curious
rushing
sound
was
audible
the
atmosphere
visibly
disturbed
and
shaken
that
a
shadow
fell
upon
the
spot
the
couple
had
vacated
that
a
cry
was
heard
a
high
wild
searching
cry
horus
bright
deity
of
wind
it
began
then
died
away
one
man
was
positive
that
the
windows
had
been
opened
and
that
something
had
flown
in
it
was
the
obvious
explanation
the
thing
spread
horribly
as
in
a
there
was
consternation
and
excitement
confusion
caught
the
feet
of
all
the
dancers
the
music
fumbled
and
lost
time
the
leading
pair
of
tango
dancers
halted
and
looked
round
it
seemed
that
everybody
pressed
back
hiding
shuffling
eager
to
see
yet
more
eager
not
to
be
seen
as
though
something
dangerous
hostile
terrible
had
broken
loose
in
rows
against
the
wall
they
stood
for
a
great
space
had
made
itself
in
the
middle
of
the
and
into
this
empty
space
appeared
suddenly
the
pierrot
and
the
dove
it
was
like
a
challenge
a
sound
of
applause
half
voices
half
clapping
of
gloved
hands
was
heard
the
couple
danced
exquisitely
into
the
arena
all
stared
there
was
an
impression
that
a
set
piece
had
been
prepared
and
that
this
was
its
beginning
the
music
again
took
heart
pierrot
was
strong
and
dignified
no
whit
nonplussed
by
this
abrupt
publicity
the
dove
though
faltering
was
deliciously
obedient
they
danced
together
like
a
single
outline
she
was
captured
utterly
and
to
the
man
who
needed
her
the
sight
was
naturally
agonizing
the
protective
way
the
pierrot
held
her
the
right
and
strength
of
it
the
mastery
the
complete
possession
he
got
her
some
one
breathed
too
loud
uttering
the
thought
of
all
good
thing
it
not
the
hawk
and
to
the
absolute
amazement
of
the
throng
this
sight
was
then
apparent
a
figure
dropped
through
space
that
high
shrill
cry
again
was
heard
feather
my
soul
to
know
thy
awful
swiftness
its
singing
loveliness
touched
the
heart
its
appealing
passionate
sweetness
was
marvellous
as
from
the
gallery
this
figure
of
a
man
dressed
as
a
strong
dark
bird
shot
down
with
splendid
grace
and
ease
the
feathers
swept
the
swings
spread
out
as
sails
that
take
the
wind
like
a
hawk
that
darts
with
unerring
power
and
aim
upon
its
prey
this
thing
of
mighty
wings
rushed
down
into
the
empty
space
where
the
two
danced
observed
by
all
he
entered
swooping
beautifully
stretching
his
wings
like
any
eagle
he
dropped
he
fixed
his
point
of
landing
with
consummate
skill
close
beside
the
astonished
dancers
he
landed
it
happened
with
such
swiftness
it
brought
the
dazzle
and
blindness
as
when
lightning
strikes
people
in
different
parts
of
the
room
saw
different
details
a
few
saw
nothing
at
all
after
the
first
startling
shock
closing
their
eyes
or
holding
their
arms
before
their
faces
as
in
the
touch
of
panic
fear
caught
the
entire
room
the
nameless
thing
that
all
the
evening
had
been
vaguely
felt
was
come
it
had
suddenly
materialised
for
this
incredible
thing
occurred
in
the
full
blaze
of
light
upon
the
open
floor
binovitch
grown
in
some
sense
formidable
opened
his
dark
big
wings
about
the
girl
the
long
grey
feathers
moved
causing
powerful
draughts
of
wind
that
made
a
rushing
sound
an
aspect
of
the
terrible
was
about
him
like
an
emanation
the
great
beaked
head
was
poised
to
strike
the
tufted
claws
were
raised
like
fingers
that
shut
and
opened
and
the
whole
presentment
of
his
amazing
figure
focused
in
an
attitude
of
attack
that
was
magnificent
and
terrible
no
one
who
saw
it
doubted
yet
there
were
those
who
swore
that
it
was
not
binovitch
at
all
but
that
another
outline
monstrous
and
shadowy
towered
above
him
draping
his
lesser
proportions
with
two
colossal
wings
of
darkness
that
some
touch
of
strange
divinity
lay
in
it
may
be
claimed
however
confused
the
wild
descriptions
afterward
for
many
lowered
their
heads
and
bowed
their
shoulders
there
was
terror
there
was
also
awe
the
onlookers
swayed
as
though
some
power
passed
over
them
through
the
air
a
sound
of
wings
was
certainly
in
the
room
then
some
one
screamed
a
shriek
broke
high
and
clear
and
emotion
ordinary
human
emotion
unaccustomed
to
terrific
things
swept
loose
the
hawk
and
vera
flew
beaten
back
against
the
wall
as
by
a
stroke
of
whirlwind
the
pierrot
staggered
he
watched
them
go
out
of
the
lighted
room
they
flew
out
of
the
crowded
human
atmosphere
out
of
the
heat
and
artificial
light
the
airless
halls
that
were
a
cage
all
this
they
left
behind
they
seemed
things
of
wind
and
air
made
free
happily
of
another
element
earth
held
them
not
toward
the
open
night
they
raced
with
this
extraordinary
lightness
as
of
birds
down
the
long
corridor
and
on
to
the
southern
terrace
where
great
coloured
curtains
were
hung
suspended
from
the
columns
a
moment
they
were
visible
then
the
fringe
of
one
huge
curtain
lifted
by
the
wind
showed
their
dark
outline
for
a
second
against
the
starry
sky
there
was
a
cry
a
leap
the
curtain
flapped
again
and
closed
they
vanished
and
into
the
swept
the
cold
draught
of
night
air
from
the
desert
but
three
figures
instantly
were
close
upon
their
heels
the
throng
of
onlookers
it
seemed
projected
them
as
though
by
some
explosive
force
the
general
mass
held
back
but
like
projectiles
these
three
flung
themselves
after
the
fugitives
down
the
corridor
at
high
speed
the
apache
don
quixote
and
last
of
them
the
pierrot
for
khilkoff
the
brother
and
baron
minski
the
man
who
caught
wolves
alive
had
been
for
some
time
keenly
on
the
watch
while
plitzinger
reading
the
symptoms
clearly
never
far
away
had
been
faithfully
observant
of
every
movement
his
mask
tossed
aside
the
great
psychiatrist
was
now
recognised
by
all
they
reached
the
parapet
just
as
the
curtain
flapped
back
heavily
into
place
the
next
second
all
three
were
out
of
sight
behind
it
khilkoff
was
first
however
urged
forward
at
frantic
speed
by
the
warning
words
the
doctor
had
whispered
as
they
ran
some
thirty
yards
beyond
the
terrace
was
the
brink
of
the
crumbling
cliff
on
which
the
great
hotel
was
built
and
there
was
a
drop
of
sixty
feet
to
the
desert
floor
below
only
a
low
stone
wall
marked
the
edge
accounts
varied
khilkoff
it
seems
arrived
in
time
in
the
nick
of
time
to
seize
his
sister
virtually
hovering
on
the
brink
he
heard
the
loose
stones
strike
the
sand
below
there
was
no
struggle
though
it
appears
she
did
not
thank
him
for
his
interference
at
first
in
a
sense
she
was
beside
outside
herself
and
he
did
a
characteristic
thing
he
not
only
brought
her
back
into
the
but
he
her
back
it
was
admirable
nothing
could
have
calmed
the
general
excitement
better
the
pair
of
them
danced
in
together
as
though
nothing
was
amiss
accustomed
to
the
strenuous
practice
of
his
cossack
regiment
this
young
cavalry
officer
muscles
were
equal
to
the
weight
in
his
arms
at
most
the
onlookers
thought
her
tired
perhaps
confidence
was
restored
such
is
the
psychology
of
a
crowd
and
in
the
middle
of
a
thrilling
viennese
waltz
he
easily
smuggled
her
out
of
the
room
administered
brandy
and
got
her
up
to
bed
the
absence
of
the
hawk
meanwhile
was
hardly
noticed
comments
were
made
and
then
forgotten
it
was
vera
in
whom
the
strange
anxious
sympathy
had
centred
and
with
her
obvious
safety
the
moment
of
primitive
childish
panic
passed
away
don
quixote
too
was
presently
seen
dancing
gaily
as
though
nothing
untoward
had
happened
supper
intervened
the
incident
was
over
it
had
melted
into
the
general
wildness
of
the
evening
irresponsibility
the
fact
that
pierrot
did
not
appear
again
was
noticed
by
no
single
person
but
plitzinger
was
otherwise
engaged
his
heart
and
mind
and
soul
all
deeply
exercised
a
is
not
always
made
out
quite
so
simply
as
the
public
thinks
that
binovitch
had
died
of
suffocation
in
his
swift
descent
through
merely
sixty
feet
of
air
was
not
conceivable
yet
that
his
body
lay
so
neatly
placed
upon
the
desert
after
such
a
fall
was
stranger
still
it
was
not
crumpled
it
was
not
torn
no
single
bone
was
broken
no
muscle
wrenched
there
was
no
bruise
there
was
no
indenture
in
the
sand
the
figure
lay
sidewise
as
though
in
sleep
no
sign
of
violence
visible
anywhere
the
dark
wings
folded
as
a
great
bird
folds
them
when
it
creeps
away
to
die
in
loneliness
beneath
the
horus
mask
the
face
was
smiling
it
seemed
he
had
floated
into
death
upon
the
element
he
loved
and
only
vera
had
seen
the
enormous
wings
that
hovering
invitingly
above
the
dark
abyss
bore
him
so
softly
into
another
world
plitzinger
that
is
saw
them
too
but
he
said
firmly
that
they
belonged
to
the
big
black
falcons
that
haunt
the
mokattam
hills
and
roost
upon
these
ridges
close
beside
the
hotel
at
night
both
he
and
vera
however
agreed
on
one
thing
the
high
sharp
cry
in
the
air
above
them
wild
and
plaintive
was
certainly
the
black
kite
cry
the
note
of
the
falcon
that
passionately
seeks
its
mate
it
was
the
pause
of
a
second
when
she
stood
to
listen
that
made
her
rescue
possible
a
moment
later
and
she
too
would
have
flown
to
death
with
binovitch
iv
initiation
a
few
years
ago
on
a
black
sea
steamer
heading
for
the
caucasus
i
fell
into
conversation
with
an
american
he
mentioned
that
he
was
on
his
way
to
the
baku
oilfields
and
i
replied
that
i
was
going
up
into
the
mountains
he
looked
at
me
questioningly
a
moment
your
first
trip
he
asked
with
interest
i
said
it
was
a
conversation
followed
it
was
continued
the
next
day
and
renewed
the
following
day
until
we
parted
company
at
batoum
i
do
know
why
he
talked
so
freely
to
me
in
particular
normally
he
was
a
taciturn
silent
man
we
had
been
fellow
travellers
from
marseilles
but
after
constantinople
we
had
the
boat
pretty
much
to
ourselves
what
struck
me
about
him
was
his
vehement
almost
passionate
love
of
natural
beauty
in
seas
and
woods
and
sky
but
above
all
in
mountains
it
was
like
a
religion
in
him
his
taciturn
manner
hid
deep
poetic
feeling
and
he
told
me
it
had
not
always
been
so
with
him
a
kind
of
friendship
sprang
up
between
us
he
was
a
new
york
business
man
buying
and
selling
exchange
between
banks
but
was
english
born
he
had
gone
out
thirty
years
before
and
become
naturalised
his
talk
was
exceedingly
american
slangy
and
almost
western
he
said
he
had
roughed
it
in
the
west
for
a
year
or
two
first
but
what
he
chiefly
talked
about
was
mountains
he
said
it
was
in
the
mountains
an
unusual
experience
had
come
to
him
that
had
opened
his
eyes
to
many
things
but
principally
to
the
beauty
that
was
now
everything
to
him
and
to
the
insignificance
of
death
he
knew
the
caucasus
well
where
i
was
going
i
think
that
was
why
he
was
interested
in
me
and
my
journey
up
there
he
said
you
feel
things
and
maybe
find
out
things
you
never
knew
before
what
kind
of
things
i
asked
why
for
one
he
replied
with
emotion
and
enthusiasm
in
his
voice
that
living
and
dying
ai
either
of
them
of
much
account
that
if
you
know
beauty
i
mean
and
beauty
is
in
your
life
you
live
on
in
it
and
with
it
for
others
even
when
you
dead
the
conversation
that
followed
is
too
long
to
give
here
but
it
led
to
his
telling
me
the
experience
in
his
own
life
that
had
opened
his
eyes
to
the
truth
of
what
he
said
beauty
is
imperishable
he
declared
and
if
you
live
with
it
why
you
imperishable
too
the
story
as
he
told
it
verbally
in
his
curious
language
remains
vividly
in
my
memory
but
he
had
written
it
down
too
he
said
and
he
gave
me
the
written
account
with
the
remark
that
i
was
free
to
hand
it
on
to
others
if
i
felt
that
way
he
called
it
initiation
it
runs
as
follows
in
my
own
family
this
happened
for
arthur
was
my
nephew
and
a
remote
alpine
valley
was
the
place
it
did
seem
to
me
in
the
least
suitable
for
such
occurrences
except
that
it
was
catholic
and
the
church
i
understand
at
least
scholars
who
ought
to
know
have
told
me
so
has
subtle
pagan
origins
incorporated
unwittingly
in
its
observations
of
certain
saints
days
as
well
as
in
certain
ceremonials
all
this
kind
of
thing
is
dutch
to
me
a
form
of
poetry
or
superstition
for
i
am
interested
chiefly
in
the
buying
and
selling
of
exchange
with
an
office
in
new
york
city
just
off
wall
street
and
only
come
to
europe
now
occasionally
for
a
holiday
i
like
to
see
the
dear
old
musty
cities
and
go
to
the
opera
and
take
a
motor
run
through
country
or
round
the
lakes
get
in
touch
again
with
london
and
paris
at
the
ritz
hotels
and
then
back
again
to
the
greatest
city
on
earth
where
for
years
now
i
been
making
a
good
thing
out
of
it
repton
and
cambridge
long
since
forgotten
had
their
uses
they
were
all
right
enough
at
the
time
but
i
now
on
the
make
with
a
good
fat
partnership
and
have
left
all
that
truck
behind
me
my
however
he
was
my
senior
and
got
the
cream
of
the
family
wholesale
chemical
works
has
stuck
to
the
trade
in
the
old
country
and
is
making
probably
as
much
as
i
am
he
approved
my
taking
the
chance
that
offered
and
is
only
sore
now
because
his
son
arthur
is
on
the
stupid
side
he
agreed
that
finance
suited
my
temperament
far
better
than
drugs
and
chemicals
though
he
warned
me
that
all
american
finance
was
speculative
and
therefore
dangerous
arthur
is
getting
on
he
said
in
his
last
letter
and
will
some
day
take
the
place
you
would
be
in
now
had
you
cared
to
stay
but
he
a
plodder
rather
that
meant
i
knew
that
arthur
was
a
fool
business
at
any
rate
was
not
suited
to
his
temperament
five
years
ago
when
i
came
home
with
a
month
holiday
to
be
used
in
working
up
connections
in
english
banking
circles
i
saw
the
boy
he
was
fifteen
years
of
age
at
the
time
a
delicate
youth
with
an
artist
dreams
in
his
big
blue
eyes
if
my
memory
goes
for
anything
but
with
a
tangle
of
yellow
hair
and
features
of
classical
beauty
that
would
have
made
half
the
young
girls
of
my
new
york
set
in
love
with
him
and
a
choice
of
heiresses
at
his
disposal
when
he
wanted
them
i
have
a
clear
recollection
of
my
nephew
then
he
struck
me
as
having
grit
and
character
but
as
being
wrongly
placed
he
had
his
grandfather
tastes
he
ought
to
have
been
like
him
a
great
scholar
a
poet
an
editor
of
marvellous
old
writings
in
new
editions
i
could
get
much
out
of
the
boy
except
that
he
liked
the
chemical
business
fairly
and
meant
to
please
his
father
by
knowing
it
thoroughly
so
as
to
qualify
later
for
his
directorship
but
i
have
never
forgotten
the
evening
when
i
caught
him
in
the
hall
staring
up
at
his
grandfather
picture
with
a
kind
of
light
about
his
face
and
the
big
blue
eyes
all
rapt
and
tender
almost
as
if
he
had
been
crying
and
replying
when
i
asked
him
what
was
up
was
worth
living
for
he
brought
beauty
back
into
the
world
yes
i
said
i
guess
that
right
enough
he
did
but
there
was
no
money
in
it
to
speak
of
the
boy
looked
at
me
and
smiled
he
twigged
somehow
or
other
that
deep
down
in
me
somewhere
below
the
instinct
a
poet
but
a
dumb
poet
lay
in
hiding
you
know
what
i
mean
he
said
it
in
you
too
the
picture
was
a
copy
my
father
had
it
made
of
the
presentation
portrait
given
to
baliol
and
the
grandfather
was
celebrated
in
his
day
for
the
translations
he
made
of
anacreon
and
sappho
of
homer
too
if
i
remember
rightly
as
well
as
for
a
number
of
classical
studies
and
essays
that
he
wrote
a
lot
of
stuff
like
that
he
did
and
made
a
name
at
it
too
his
of
the
went
into
six
editions
they
said
the
big
critics
of
his
day
that
he
was
a
poet
who
wrote
no
poetry
yet
lived
it
passionately
in
the
spirit
of
classical
beauty
and
i
know
he
was
a
wonderful
fellow
in
his
way
and
made
the
dons
and
schoolmasters
all
sit
up
we
proud
of
him
all
right
after
years
of
successful
exchange
in
new
york
city
i
confess
i
am
unable
to
appreciate
all
that
feeling
more
in
touch
with
the
commercial
and
financial
spirit
of
the
age
progress
development
and
the
rest
but
still
i
not
ashamed
of
the
classical
old
boy
who
seems
to
have
been
a
good
deal
of
a
pagan
judging
by
the
records
we
have
kept
however
arthur
peering
up
at
that
picture
in
the
dusk
his
eyes
half
moist
with
emotion
and
his
voice
gone
positively
shaky
is
a
thing
i
never
have
forgotten
he
stimulated
my
curiosity
uncommonly
it
stirred
something
deep
down
in
me
that
i
hardly
cared
to
acknowledge
on
wall
street
something
burning
and
the
next
time
i
saw
him
was
in
the
summer
of
when
i
came
to
europe
for
a
two
months
look
around
my
wife
at
newport
with
the
children
and
hearing
that
he
was
in
switzerland
learning
a
bit
of
french
to
help
him
in
the
business
i
made
a
point
of
dropping
in
upon
him
just
to
see
how
he
was
shaping
generally
and
what
new
kinks
his
mind
had
taken
on
there
was
something
in
arthur
i
never
could
quite
forget
whenever
his
face
came
into
my
mind
i
began
to
think
a
kind
of
longing
came
over
me
a
desire
for
beauty
i
guess
it
was
it
made
me
dream
i
found
him
at
an
english
tutor
a
lively
old
dog
with
a
fondness
for
the
cheap
native
wines
and
a
financial
interest
in
the
tourist
development
of
the
village
the
boys
learnt
french
in
the
mornings
possibly
but
for
the
rest
of
the
day
were
free
to
amuse
themselves
exactly
as
they
pleased
and
without
a
trace
of
supervision
provided
the
parents
footed
the
bills
without
demur
this
suited
everybody
all
round
and
as
long
as
the
boys
came
home
with
an
accent
and
a
vocabulary
all
was
well
for
myself
having
learned
in
new
york
to
attend
strictly
to
my
own
business
exchange
between
different
countries
with
a
profit
i
did
not
deem
it
necessary
to
exchange
letters
and
opinions
with
my
brother
with
no
chance
of
profit
anywhere
but
i
got
to
know
arthur
and
had
a
queer
experience
of
my
own
into
the
bargain
oh
there
was
profit
in
it
for
me
i
drawing
big
dividends
to
this
day
on
the
investment
i
put
up
at
the
best
hotel
in
the
village
a
show
differing
from
the
other
inns
only
in
the
prices
charged
for
a
lot
of
cheap
decoration
in
the
and
went
up
to
surprise
my
nephew
with
a
call
the
first
thing
after
dinner
the
tutor
house
stood
some
way
back
from
the
narrow
street
among
fields
where
there
were
more
flowers
than
grass
and
backed
by
a
forest
of
fine
old
timber
that
stretched
up
several
thousand
feet
to
the
snow
the
snow
at
least
was
visible
peeping
out
far
overhead
just
where
the
dark
line
of
forest
stopped
but
in
reality
i
suppose
that
was
an
effect
of
foreshortening
and
whole
valleys
and
pastures
intervened
between
the
trees
and
the
the
sunset
long
since
out
of
the
valley
still
shone
on
those
white
ridges
where
the
peaks
stuck
up
like
the
teeth
of
a
gigantic
saw
i
guess
it
meant
five
or
six
hours
good
climbing
to
get
up
to
them
and
nothing
to
do
when
you
got
there
switzerland
anyway
seemed
a
poor
country
with
its
little
bit
of
sour
wines
and
every
square
yard
hanging
upstairs
at
an
angle
of
degrees
used
for
hay
picture
postcards
chocolate
and
cheap
tourists
kept
it
going
apparently
but
i
dare
say
it
was
all
right
enough
to
learn
french
in
and
cheap
as
hoboken
to
live
in
arthur
was
out
i
just
left
a
card
and
wrote
on
it
that
i
would
be
very
pleased
if
he
cared
to
step
down
to
take
luncheon
with
me
at
my
hotel
next
day
having
nothing
better
to
do
i
strolled
homewards
by
way
of
the
forest
now
what
came
over
me
in
that
bit
of
dark
pine
forest
is
more
than
i
can
quite
explain
but
i
think
it
must
have
been
due
to
the
height
the
village
was
feet
above
and
the
effect
of
the
rarefied
air
upon
my
circulation
the
nearest
thing
to
it
in
my
experience
is
rye
whisky
the
queer
touch
of
wildness
of
a
kind
of
whooping
rapture
and
the
reckless
sensation
of
being
a
tin
god
of
sorts
that
comes
from
a
lot
of
alcohol
a
memory
please
understand
of
years
before
when
i
thought
it
a
grand
thing
to
own
the
earth
and
paint
the
old
town
red
i
seemed
to
walk
on
air
and
there
was
a
smell
about
those
trees
that
made
me
suddenly
well
that
took
my
mind
clean
out
of
its
accustomed
rut
it
was
just
too
lovely
and
wonderful
for
me
to
describe
it
i
had
got
well
into
the
forest
and
lost
my
way
a
bit
the
smell
of
an
garden
was
in
it
it
smelt
to
me
as
if
some
one
had
just
that
minute
turned
out
the
earth
all
fresh
and
new
there
was
moss
and
tannin
a
hint
of
burning
something
between
smoke
and
incense
say
and
a
fine
clean
odour
of
bark
when
the
sun
gets
on
it
after
rain
and
a
flavour
of
the
sea
thrown
in
for
luck
that
was
the
first
i
noticed
for
i
had
never
smelt
anything
half
so
good
since
my
camping
days
on
the
coast
of
maine
and
i
stood
still
to
enjoy
it
i
threw
away
my
cigar
for
fear
of
mixing
things
and
spoiling
it
if
that
could
be
bottled
i
said
to
myself
it
sell
for
two
dollars
a
pint
in
every
city
in
the
union
and
it
was
just
then
while
standing
and
breathing
it
in
that
i
got
the
queer
feeling
of
some
one
watching
me
i
kept
quite
still
some
one
was
moving
near
me
the
sweat
went
trickling
down
my
back
a
kind
of
childhood
thrill
got
hold
of
me
it
was
very
dark
i
was
not
afraid
exactly
but
i
was
a
stranger
in
these
parts
and
knew
nothing
about
the
habits
of
the
mountain
peasants
there
might
be
tough
customers
lurking
around
after
dark
on
the
chance
of
striking
some
guy
of
a
tourist
with
money
in
his
pockets
yet
somehow
that
was
the
kind
of
feeling
that
came
to
me
at
all
for
though
i
had
a
pocket
browning
at
my
hip
the
notion
of
getting
at
it
did
not
even
occur
to
me
the
sensation
was
new
a
kind
of
lifting
exciting
sensation
that
made
my
heart
swell
out
with
exhilaration
there
was
happiness
in
it
a
cloud
that
seemed
to
roll
off
my
mind
same
as
that
mood
when
the
office
door
is
locked
and
i
off
on
a
two
months
holiday
with
gaiety
and
irresponsibility
at
the
back
of
it
it
was
invigorating
i
felt
youth
sweep
over
me
i
stood
there
wondering
what
on
earth
was
coming
on
me
and
half
expecting
that
any
moment
some
one
would
come
out
of
the
darkness
and
show
himself
and
as
i
held
my
breath
and
made
no
movement
at
all
the
queer
sensation
grew
stronger
i
believe
i
even
resisted
a
temptation
to
kick
up
my
heels
and
dance
to
let
out
a
flying
shout
as
a
man
with
liquor
in
him
does
instead
of
this
however
i
just
kept
dead
still
the
wood
was
black
as
ink
all
round
me
too
black
to
see
the
separately
except
far
below
where
the
village
lights
came
up
twinkling
between
them
and
the
only
way
i
kept
the
path
was
by
the
soft
feel
of
the
that
were
thicker
than
a
brussels
carpet
but
nothing
happened
and
no
one
stirred
the
idea
that
i
was
being
watched
remained
only
there
was
no
sound
anywhere
except
the
roar
of
falling
water
that
filled
the
entire
valley
yet
some
one
was
very
close
to
me
in
the
darkness
i
ca
say
how
long
i
might
have
stood
there
but
i
guess
it
was
the
best
part
of
ten
minutes
and
i
remember
it
struck
me
that
i
had
run
up
against
a
pocket
of
air
that
had
a
lot
of
oxygen
in
it
oxygen
or
something
similar
and
that
was
the
cause
of
my
elation
the
idea
was
nonsense
i
have
no
doubt
but
for
the
moment
it
half
explained
the
thing
to
me
i
realised
it
was
all
enough
at
any
rate
and
so
moved
on
it
took
a
longish
time
to
reach
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
a
footpath
led
me
oh
it
was
quite
a
walk
i
tell
you
into
the
village
street
again
i
was
both
glad
and
sorry
to
get
there
i
kept
myself
busy
thinking
the
whole
thing
over
again
what
caught
me
all
of
a
heap
was
that
sense
of
beauty
youth
and
happiness
never
in
my
born
days
had
i
felt
anything
to
touch
it
and
it
had
cost
a
cent
well
i
was
sitting
there
enjoying
my
smoke
and
trying
to
puzzle
it
all
out
and
the
hall
was
pretty
full
of
people
smoking
and
talking
and
reading
papers
and
so
forth
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
looked
up
and
caught
my
breath
with
such
a
jerk
that
i
actually
bit
my
tongue
there
was
grandfather
in
front
of
my
chair
i
looked
into
his
eyes
i
saw
him
as
clear
and
solid
as
the
porter
standing
behind
his
desk
across
the
lounge
and
it
gave
me
a
touch
of
cold
all
down
the
back
that
i
forget
unless
i
want
to
he
was
looking
into
my
face
and
he
had
a
cap
in
his
hand
and
he
was
speaking
to
me
it
was
my
grandfather
picture
come
to
life
only
much
thinner
and
younger
and
a
kind
of
light
in
his
eyes
like
fire
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
uncle
jim
are
you
and
then
with
another
jump
of
my
nerves
i
understood
you
arthur
well
i
jiggered
so
it
is
take
a
chair
boy
right
glad
you
found
me
shake
sit
down
and
i
shook
his
hand
and
pushed
a
chair
up
for
him
i
was
never
so
surprised
in
my
life
the
last
time
i
set
eyes
on
him
he
was
a
boy
now
he
was
a
young
man
and
the
very
image
of
his
ancestor
he
sat
down
fingering
his
cap
he
would
have
a
drink
and
he
would
smoke
all
right
i
said
let
talk
then
i
lots
to
tell
you
and
i
lots
to
hear
how
are
you
boy
he
did
answer
at
first
he
eyed
me
up
and
down
he
hesitated
he
was
as
handsome
as
a
young
greek
god
i
say
uncle
jim
he
began
presently
it
you
just
now
in
the
wood
was
it
it
made
me
start
that
question
put
so
quietly
i
just
come
through
that
wood
up
there
i
answered
pointing
in
the
direction
as
well
as
i
could
remember
if
that
what
you
mean
but
why
were
there
were
you
it
gave
me
a
queer
sort
of
feeling
to
hear
him
say
it
what
in
the
name
of
heaven
did
he
mean
he
sat
back
in
his
chair
with
a
sigh
of
relief
oh
that
all
right
then
he
said
if
it
you
did
you
see
he
asked
suddenly
did
you
see
anything
not
a
thing
i
told
him
honestly
it
was
far
too
dark
i
laughed
i
fancied
i
twigged
his
meaning
but
i
was
not
the
sort
of
uncle
to
come
prying
on
him
life
must
be
dull
enough
i
remembered
in
this
mountain
village
but
he
did
understand
my
laugh
he
did
mean
what
i
meant
and
there
came
a
pause
between
us
i
discovered
that
we
were
talking
different
lingoes
i
leaned
over
towards
him
look
here
arthur
i
said
in
a
lower
voice
what
is
it
and
what
do
you
mean
i
all
right
you
know
and
you
need
be
afraid
of
telling
me
what
mean
by
did
i
see
anything
we
looked
each
other
squarely
in
the
eye
he
saw
he
could
trust
me
and
i
saw
well
a
whole
lot
of
things
perhaps
but
i
felt
chiefly
that
he
liked
me
and
would
tell
me
things
later
all
in
his
own
good
time
i
liked
him
all
the
better
for
that
too
i
only
meant
he
answered
slowly
whether
you
really
anything
no
i
said
straight
i
did
see
a
thing
but
by
the
gods
i
something
he
started
i
started
too
an
astonishing
big
look
came
swimming
over
his
fair
handsome
face
his
eyes
seemed
all
lit
up
he
looked
as
if
he
just
made
a
cool
million
in
wheat
or
cotton
i
knew
you
were
that
sort
he
whispered
though
i
hardly
remembered
what
you
looked
like
then
what
on
earth
was
it
i
asked
his
reply
staggered
me
a
bit
it
was
just
that
he
said
the
earth
and
then
just
when
things
were
getting
interesting
and
promising
a
dividend
he
shut
up
like
a
clam
he
would
say
another
word
he
asked
after
my
family
and
business
my
health
what
kind
of
crossing
i
had
and
all
the
rest
of
the
common
stock
it
fairly
bowled
me
over
and
i
could
change
him
either
i
suppose
in
america
we
get
pretty
free
and
easy
and
do
quite
understand
reserve
but
this
young
man
of
half
my
age
kept
me
in
my
place
as
easily
as
i
might
have
kept
a
nervous
customer
quiet
in
my
own
office
he
just
refused
to
take
me
on
he
was
polite
and
cool
and
distant
as
you
please
and
when
i
got
pressing
sometimes
he
simply
pretended
he
did
understand
i
could
no
more
get
him
back
again
to
the
subject
of
the
wood
than
a
customer
could
have
gotten
me
to
tell
him
about
the
prospects
of
exchange
being
cheap
or
dear
when
i
know
myself
but
would
let
him
see
i
did
know
he
was
charming
he
was
delightful
enthusiastic
and
even
affectionate
downright
glad
to
see
me
too
and
to
chin
with
me
but
i
could
draw
him
worth
a
cent
and
in
the
end
i
gave
up
trying
and
the
moment
i
gave
up
trying
he
let
down
a
little
but
only
a
very
little
you
stay
here
some
time
uncle
jim
wo
you
that
my
idea
i
said
if
i
can
see
you
and
you
can
show
me
round
some
he
laughed
with
pleasure
oh
rather
i
got
lots
of
time
after
three
in
the
afternoon
i
free
till
any
time
you
like
there
a
lot
to
see
he
added
come
along
then
i
said
if
you
ca
take
lunch
perhaps
you
can
come
just
afterwards
you
find
me
waiting
for
you
right
here
i
come
at
three
he
replied
and
we
said
he
turned
up
sharp
at
three
and
i
liked
his
punctuality
i
saw
him
come
swinging
down
the
dusty
road
tall
his
broad
shoulders
a
trifle
high
and
his
head
set
proudly
he
looked
like
a
young
chap
in
training
a
thoroughbred
every
inch
of
him
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
touch
of
something
a
little
too
refined
and
delicate
for
a
man
i
thought
that
was
the
poetic
scholarly
vein
in
him
i
guess
grandfather
cropping
out
this
time
he
wore
no
cap
his
thick
light
hair
not
brushed
back
like
the
london
but
parted
on
the
side
yet
untidy
for
all
that
suited
him
exactly
and
gave
him
a
touch
of
wildness
well
he
asked
what
would
you
like
to
do
uncle
jim
i
at
your
service
and
i
got
the
whole
afternoon
till
supper
at
i
told
him
i
like
to
go
through
that
wood
all
right
he
said
come
along
i
show
you
he
gave
me
one
quick
glance
but
said
no
more
i
like
to
see
if
i
feel
anything
this
time
i
explained
we
locate
the
very
spot
maybe
he
nodded
you
know
where
i
mean
do
you
i
asked
because
you
saw
me
there
he
just
said
yes
and
then
we
started
it
was
hot
and
air
was
scarce
i
remember
that
we
went
uphill
and
that
i
realised
there
was
considerable
difference
in
our
ages
we
crossed
some
fields
first
smothered
in
flowers
so
thick
that
i
wondered
how
much
grass
the
cows
got
out
of
it
and
then
came
to
a
sprinkling
of
fine
young
larches
that
looked
as
soft
as
velvet
there
was
no
path
just
a
wild
mountain
side
i
had
very
little
breath
on
the
steep
zigzags
but
arthur
talked
easily
and
talked
mighty
well
too
the
light
and
shade
the
colouring
and
the
effect
of
all
this
wilderness
of
lonely
beauty
on
the
mind
he
kept
all
this
suppressed
at
home
in
business
it
was
safety
valves
i
twigged
it
was
the
artist
in
him
talking
he
seemed
to
think
there
was
nothing
in
the
world
but
beauty
with
a
big
b
all
the
time
and
the
odd
thing
was
he
took
for
granted
that
i
felt
the
same
it
was
cute
of
him
to
flatter
me
that
way
daulis
and
the
lone
cephissian
vale
i
heard
and
a
few
moments
later
with
a
sort
of
reverence
in
his
voice
like
worship
he
called
out
a
great
singing
name
day
is
her
face
and
midnight
is
her
hair
and
morning
hours
are
but
the
golden
stair
by
which
she
climbs
to
night
it
was
here
first
that
a
queer
change
began
to
grow
upon
me
too
steady
on
boy
i
forgotten
all
my
classics
ages
ago
i
cried
he
turned
and
gazed
down
on
me
his
big
eyes
glowing
and
not
a
sign
of
perspiration
on
his
skin
that
nothing
he
exclaimed
in
his
musical
deep
voice
you
know
it
or
you
never
have
felt
things
in
this
wood
last
night
and
you
would
have
wanted
to
come
out
with
me
how
i
gasped
how
that
you
come
he
continued
quietly
to
the
only
valley
in
this
artificial
country
that
has
atmosphere
this
valley
is
especially
this
end
of
it
there
superstition
here
thank
god
even
the
peasants
know
things
i
stared
at
him
see
here
arthur
i
objected
i
not
a
cath
and
i
do
know
a
thing
at
least
it
all
dead
in
me
and
forgotten
about
poetry
or
classics
or
your
gods
and
pan
pantheism
in
spite
of
grandfather
his
face
turned
like
a
dream
face
hush
he
said
quickly
do
mention
there
a
bit
of
him
in
you
as
well
as
in
me
and
it
was
here
you
know
he
wrote
i
did
hear
the
rest
of
what
he
said
a
creep
came
over
me
i
remembered
that
this
ancestor
of
ours
lived
for
years
in
the
isolation
of
some
swiss
forest
where
he
claimed
he
used
that
setting
for
his
writing
he
had
found
the
exiled
gods
their
ghosts
their
beauty
their
eternal
essences
or
something
astonishing
of
that
sort
i
had
clean
forgotten
it
till
this
moment
it
all
rushed
back
upon
me
a
memory
of
my
boyhood
and
as
i
say
a
creep
came
over
me
something
as
near
to
awe
as
ever
could
be
the
sunshine
on
that
field
of
yellow
daisies
and
blue
turned
pale
that
warm
valley
wind
had
a
touch
of
snow
in
it
and
ashamed
and
frightened
of
my
baby
mood
i
looked
at
arthur
meaning
to
choke
him
off
with
all
this
rubbish
and
then
saw
something
in
his
eyes
that
scared
me
stiff
i
admit
it
what
the
use
there
was
an
expression
on
his
fine
big
face
that
made
my
blood
go
curdled
i
got
cold
feet
right
there
it
mastered
me
in
him
behind
him
near
him
blest
if
i
know
which
him
probably
came
an
enormous
thing
that
turned
me
insignificant
it
downed
me
utterly
it
was
over
in
a
second
the
flash
of
a
wing
i
recovered
instantly
no
mere
boy
should
come
these
muzzy
tricks
on
me
scholar
or
no
scholar
for
the
change
in
me
was
on
the
increase
and
i
shrank
see
here
arthur
i
said
plainly
once
again
i
do
know
what
your
game
is
but
there
something
queer
up
here
i
do
quite
get
at
only
a
business
man
with
classics
and
poetry
all
gone
dry
in
me
twenty
years
ago
and
more
he
looked
at
me
so
strangely
that
i
stopped
confused
but
uncle
jim
he
said
as
quietly
as
though
we
talked
tobacco
brands
you
need
be
alarmed
it
natural
you
should
feel
the
place
you
and
i
belong
to
it
we
both
got
in
us
you
just
as
proud
of
him
as
i
am
only
in
a
different
way
and
then
he
added
with
a
touch
of
disappointment
i
thought
you
like
it
you
afraid
last
night
you
felt
the
beauty
flattery
is
a
darned
subtle
thing
at
any
time
to
see
him
standing
over
me
in
that
superior
way
and
talking
down
at
my
poor
business
mind
well
it
just
came
over
me
that
i
was
laying
my
cards
on
the
table
a
bit
too
early
after
so
many
years
of
city
life
anyway
i
pulled
myself
together
i
was
only
kidding
you
boy
i
laughed
i
feel
this
beauty
just
as
much
as
you
do
only
i
guess
you
more
accustomed
to
it
than
i
am
come
on
now
i
added
with
energy
getting
upon
my
feet
let
push
on
and
see
the
wood
i
want
to
find
that
place
again
he
pulled
me
with
a
hand
of
iron
laughing
as
he
did
so
gee
i
wished
i
had
his
teeth
as
well
as
the
muscles
in
his
arm
yet
i
felt
younger
somehow
too
youth
flowed
more
and
more
into
my
veins
i
had
forgotten
how
sweet
the
winds
and
woods
and
flowers
could
be
something
melted
in
me
for
it
was
spring
and
the
whole
world
was
singing
like
a
dream
beauty
was
creeping
over
me
i
do
know
i
began
to
feel
all
big
and
tender
and
open
to
a
thousand
wonderful
sensations
the
thought
of
streets
and
houses
seemed
like
death
we
went
on
again
not
talking
much
my
breath
got
shorter
and
shorter
and
he
kept
looking
about
him
as
though
he
expected
something
but
we
passed
no
living
soul
not
even
a
peasant
there
were
no
chalets
no
cattle
no
cattle
shelters
even
and
then
i
realised
that
the
valley
lay
at
our
feet
in
haze
and
that
we
had
been
climbing
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
why
last
night
i
got
home
in
twenty
minutes
at
the
outside
i
said
he
shook
his
head
smiling
it
seemed
like
that
he
replied
but
you
really
took
much
longer
it
was
long
after
ten
when
i
found
you
in
the
hall
i
reflected
a
moment
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
you
right
arthur
seems
curious
though
somehow
he
looked
closely
at
me
i
followed
you
all
the
way
he
said
you
followed
me
and
you
went
at
a
good
pace
too
it
was
your
feelings
that
made
it
seem
so
short
you
were
singing
to
yourself
and
happy
as
a
dancing
faun
we
kept
close
behind
you
for
a
long
way
i
think
it
was
we
he
said
but
for
some
reason
or
other
i
did
care
to
ask
maybe
i
answered
shortly
trying
uncomfortably
to
recall
what
particular
capers
i
had
cut
i
guess
that
right
and
then
i
added
something
about
the
loneliness
and
how
deserted
all
this
slope
of
mountain
was
and
he
explained
that
the
peasants
were
afraid
of
it
and
called
it
no
man
land
from
one
year
end
to
another
no
human
foot
went
up
or
down
it
the
hay
was
never
cut
no
cattle
grazed
along
the
splendid
pastures
no
chalet
had
even
been
built
within
a
mile
of
the
wood
we
slowly
made
for
they
superstitious
he
told
me
it
was
just
the
same
a
hundred
years
ago
when
discovered
it
there
was
a
little
natural
cave
on
the
edge
of
the
forest
where
he
used
to
sleep
sometimes
i
show
it
to
you
presently
but
for
generations
this
entire
has
been
undisturbed
you
never
meet
a
living
soul
in
any
part
of
it
he
stopped
and
pointed
above
us
to
where
the
pine
wood
hung
in
like
a
dim
blue
carpet
it
just
the
place
for
them
you
see
and
a
thrill
of
power
went
smashing
through
me
i
ca
describe
it
it
drenched
me
like
a
waterfall
i
thought
of
greece
mount
ida
and
a
thousand
songs
something
in
me
it
was
like
the
click
of
a
shutter
announced
that
the
change
was
suddenly
complete
i
was
another
man
or
rather
a
deeper
part
of
me
took
command
my
very
language
showed
it
the
calm
of
halcyon
weather
lay
over
all
overhead
the
peaks
rose
clear
as
crystal
below
us
the
village
lay
in
a
bluish
smudge
of
smoke
and
haze
as
though
a
great
finger
had
rubbed
them
softly
into
the
earth
absolute
loneliness
fell
upon
me
like
a
clap
from
the
world
of
human
beings
we
seemed
quite
shut
off
and
there
began
to
steal
over
me
again
the
strange
elation
of
the
night
before
we
found
ourselves
almost
at
once
against
the
edge
of
the
wood
it
rose
in
front
of
us
a
big
wall
of
splendid
trees
motionless
as
if
cut
out
of
dark
green
metal
the
branches
hanging
stiff
and
the
crowd
of
trunks
lost
in
the
blue
dimness
underneath
i
shaded
my
eyes
with
one
hand
trying
to
peer
into
the
solemn
gloom
the
contrast
between
the
brilliant
sunshine
on
the
pastures
and
this
region
of
heavy
shadows
blurred
my
sight
it
like
the
entrance
to
another
world
i
whispered
it
is
said
arthur
watching
me
we
will
go
in
you
shall
pluck
asphodel
and
before
i
knew
it
he
had
me
by
the
hand
we
were
advancing
we
left
the
light
behind
us
the
cool
air
dropped
upon
me
like
a
sheet
there
was
a
temple
silence
the
sun
ran
down
behind
the
sky
leaving
a
marvellous
blue
radiance
everywhere
nothing
stirred
but
through
the
stillness
there
rose
power
power
that
has
no
name
power
that
hides
at
the
foundations
somewhere
foundations
that
are
changeless
invisible
everlasting
what
do
i
mean
my
mind
grew
to
the
dimensions
of
a
planet
we
were
among
the
roots
of
life
whence
issues
that
in
infinite
guise
that
seeks
so
many
temporary
names
from
the
protean
minds
of
men
you
shall
pluck
asphodel
in
the
meadows
this
side
of
erebus
arthur
was
chanting
hermes
himself
the
psychopomp
shall
lead
and
malahide
shall
welcome
us
malahide
to
hear
him
use
that
name
the
name
of
our
now
dead
and
buried
close
upon
a
century
the
way
he
half
chanted
it
gave
me
the
i
stopped
against
a
thinking
of
escape
no
words
came
to
me
at
the
moment
for
i
did
know
what
to
say
but
on
turning
to
find
the
bright
green
slopes
just
left
behind
i
saw
only
a
crowd
of
trees
and
shadows
hanging
thick
as
a
curtain
as
though
we
had
walked
a
mile
and
it
was
a
shock
the
way
out
was
lost
the
trees
closed
up
behind
us
like
a
tide
it
all
right
said
arthur
just
keep
an
open
mind
and
a
heart
alive
with
love
it
has
a
shattering
effect
at
first
but
that
will
pass
he
saw
i
was
afraid
for
i
shrank
visibly
enough
he
stood
beside
me
in
his
grey
flannel
suit
with
his
brilliant
eyes
and
his
great
shock
of
hair
looking
more
like
a
column
of
light
than
a
human
being
it
all
quite
right
and
natural
he
repeated
we
have
passed
the
gateway
and
hecate
who
presides
over
gateways
will
let
us
out
again
do
not
make
discord
by
feeling
fear
this
is
a
pine
wood
and
pines
are
the
oldest
simplest
trees
they
are
true
primitives
they
are
an
open
channel
and
in
a
pine
wood
where
no
human
life
has
ever
been
you
shall
often
find
gateways
where
hecate
is
kind
to
such
as
us
he
took
my
hand
he
must
have
felt
mine
trembling
but
his
own
was
cool
and
strong
and
felt
like
silver
and
led
me
forward
into
the
depths
of
a
wood
that
seemed
to
me
quite
endless
it
felt
endless
that
is
to
say
i
do
know
what
came
over
me
fear
slipped
away
and
elation
took
its
place
as
we
advanced
over
ground
that
seemed
level
or
slightly
undulating
i
saw
bright
pools
of
sunshine
here
and
there
upon
the
forest
floor
great
shafts
of
light
dropped
in
slantingly
between
the
trunks
there
was
movement
everywhere
though
i
never
could
see
what
moved
a
delicious
scented
air
stirred
through
the
lower
branches
running
water
sang
not
very
far
away
figures
i
did
not
actually
see
yet
there
were
limbs
and
flowing
draperies
and
flying
hair
from
time
to
time
ever
just
beyond
the
pools
of
sunlight
surprise
went
from
me
too
i
was
on
air
the
atmosphere
of
dream
came
round
me
but
a
dream
of
something
just
hovering
outside
the
world
i
knew
a
dream
wrought
in
gold
and
silver
with
shining
eyes
with
graceful
beckoning
hands
and
with
voices
that
rang
like
bells
of
music
and
the
pools
of
light
grew
larger
merging
one
into
another
until
a
delicate
soft
light
shone
equably
throughout
the
entire
forest
into
this
zone
of
light
we
passed
together
then
something
fell
abruptly
at
our
feet
as
though
thrown
down
two
marvellous
shining
sprays
of
blossom
such
as
i
had
never
seen
in
all
my
days
before
asphodel
cried
my
companion
stooping
to
pick
them
up
and
handing
one
to
me
i
took
it
from
him
with
a
delight
i
could
not
understand
keep
it
he
murmured
it
is
the
sign
that
we
are
welcome
for
malahide
has
dropped
these
on
our
path
and
at
the
use
of
that
ancestral
name
it
seemed
that
a
spirit
passed
before
my
face
and
the
hair
of
my
head
stood
up
there
was
a
sense
of
violent
unhappy
contrast
a
composite
picture
presented
itself
then
rushed
away
what
was
it
my
youth
in
england
music
and
poetry
at
cambridge
and
my
passionate
love
of
greek
that
lasted
two
terms
at
most
when
malahide
great
books
formed
part
of
the
curriculum
over
against
this
then
the
drag
and
smother
of
solid
worldly
business
the
sordid
weight
of
modern
ugliness
the
bitterness
of
an
ambitious
life
and
abruptly
beyond
both
pictures
a
shining
marvellous
beauty
that
scattered
stars
beneath
my
feet
and
scarved
the
universe
with
gold
all
this
flashed
before
me
with
the
utterance
of
that
old
family
name
an
alternative
sprang
up
there
seemed
some
radical
elemental
choice
presented
to
me
to
what
i
used
to
call
my
soul
my
soul
could
take
or
leave
it
as
it
pleased
i
looked
at
arthur
moving
beside
me
like
a
shaft
of
light
what
had
come
over
me
how
had
our
walk
and
talk
and
mood
our
quite
recent
everyday
and
ordinary
view
our
normal
relationship
with
the
things
of
the
world
how
had
it
all
slipped
into
this
so
insensibly
so
easily
so
naturally
was
it
worth
while
the
question
did
ask
it
jumped
up
in
me
of
its
own
accord
was
what
worth
while
why
my
present
life
of
commonplace
and
grubbing
toil
of
course
my
city
existence
with
its
meagre
unremunerative
ambitions
ah
it
was
this
new
beauty
calling
me
this
shining
dream
that
lay
beyond
the
two
pictures
i
have
mentioned
i
did
not
argue
it
even
to
myself
but
i
understood
there
was
a
radical
change
in
me
the
buried
poet
too
long
hidden
rushed
into
the
air
like
some
great
singing
bird
i
glanced
again
at
arthur
moving
along
lightly
by
my
side
half
dancing
almost
in
his
brimming
happiness
wait
till
you
see
them
i
heard
him
singing
wait
till
you
hear
the
call
of
artemis
and
the
footsteps
of
her
flying
nymphs
wait
till
orion
thunders
overhead
and
selene
crowned
with
the
crescent
moon
drives
up
the
zenith
in
her
chariot
the
choice
will
be
beyond
all
question
then
a
great
silent
bird
with
soft
brown
plumage
whirred
across
our
path
pausing
an
instant
as
though
to
peep
then
disappearing
with
a
muted
sound
into
an
eddy
of
the
wind
it
made
the
big
trees
hid
it
it
was
an
owl
the
same
moment
i
heard
a
rush
of
liquid
song
come
pouring
through
the
forest
with
a
gush
of
almost
human
notes
and
a
pair
of
glossy
wings
flashed
past
us
swerving
upwards
to
find
the
open
sky
pointed
wings
his
favourites
exclaimed
my
companion
with
clear
joy
in
his
voice
they
all
are
here
athene
bird
procne
and
philomela
too
the
owl
the
swallow
and
the
nightingale
tereus
and
itys
are
not
far
away
and
the
entire
forest
as
he
said
it
stirred
with
movement
as
though
that
great
bird
quiet
wings
had
waked
the
sea
of
ancient
shadows
there
were
voices
too
ringing
laughing
voices
as
though
his
words
woke
echoes
that
had
been
listening
for
it
for
i
heard
sweet
singing
in
the
distance
the
names
he
had
used
perplexed
me
yet
even
i
stranger
as
i
was
to
such
refined
delights
could
not
mistake
the
passion
of
the
nightingale
and
the
dart
of
the
eager
swallow
that
wild
burst
of
music
that
curve
of
swift
escape
were
unmistakable
and
i
struck
a
stalwart
with
my
open
hand
feeling
the
need
of
hearing
touching
sensing
it
my
link
with
known
remembered
things
was
breaking
i
craved
the
satisfaction
of
the
commonplace
i
got
that
satisfaction
but
i
got
something
more
as
well
for
the
trunk
was
round
and
smooth
and
comely
it
was
no
dead
thing
i
struck
somehow
it
brushed
me
into
intercourse
with
inanimate
nature
and
next
the
desire
came
to
hear
my
voice
my
own
familiar
voice
with
the
twang
and
accent
the
new
world
climate
brings
american
exchange
place
noo
york
city
i
in
that
business
buying
and
selling
of
exchange
between
the
banks
of
two
civilised
countries
one
of
them
stoopid
and
the
other
leading
all
creation
it
was
an
effort
but
i
made
it
firmly
it
sounded
odd
remote
unreal
sunlit
woods
and
a
wind
among
the
branches
followed
close
and
sweet
upon
my
words
but
who
in
the
name
of
wall
street
said
it
england
buying
gold
i
tried
again
we
had
a
private
wire
cut
in
quick
first
national
is
selling
hephæstus
how
ridiculous
it
was
like
saying
i
take
your
scalp
unless
you
give
me
meat
it
was
barbaric
savage
centuries
ago
again
there
came
another
voice
that
caught
up
my
own
and
turned
it
into
common
syntax
some
heady
beauty
of
the
earth
rose
about
me
like
a
cloud
hark
night
comes
with
the
dusk
upon
her
eyelids
she
brings
those
dreams
that
every
holds
at
dawn
daughter
of
thanatos
and
hypnos
but
again
who
said
the
words
it
surely
was
not
arthur
my
nephew
arthur
of
learning
french
in
a
swiss
mountain
village
i
felt
well
what
did
i
feel
in
the
name
of
the
stock
exchange
and
wall
street
what
was
the
cash
surrender
of
amazing
feelings
and
turning
to
look
at
him
i
made
a
discovery
i
do
know
how
to
tell
it
quite
such
shadowy
marvels
have
never
been
my
line
of
goods
he
looked
several
things
at
once
taller
slighter
sweeter
but
chiefly
it
sounds
so
crazy
when
i
write
it
down
grander
is
the
word
i
think
and
all
spread
out
with
some
power
that
flowed
like
spring
when
it
pours
upon
a
landscape
eternally
young
and
glorious
young
i
mean
in
the
sense
of
a
field
of
flowers
in
the
spring
looks
young
and
glorious
in
the
sense
the
sky
looks
glorious
at
dawn
or
sunset
something
big
shone
through
him
like
a
storm
something
that
would
go
on
for
ever
just
as
the
earth
goes
on
always
renewing
itself
something
of
gigantic
life
that
in
the
human
sense
could
never
age
at
all
something
the
old
gods
had
but
the
figure
so
far
as
there
was
any
figure
at
all
was
that
old
family
picture
come
to
life
our
great
ancestor
and
arthur
were
one
being
and
that
one
being
was
vaster
than
a
million
people
yet
it
was
malahide
i
saw
they
laid
me
in
the
earth
i
loved
he
said
in
a
strange
thrilling
voice
like
running
wind
and
water
and
i
found
eternal
life
i
live
now
for
ever
in
their
divine
existence
i
share
the
life
that
changes
yet
can
never
pass
away
i
felt
myself
rising
like
a
cloud
as
he
said
it
a
roaring
beauty
captured
me
completely
if
i
could
tell
it
in
honest
newspaper
language
the
common
language
used
in
flats
and
offices
why
i
guess
i
could
patent
a
new
meaning
in
ordinary
words
a
new
power
of
expression
the
thing
that
all
the
churches
and
poets
and
thinkers
have
been
trying
to
say
since
the
world
began
i
caught
on
to
a
fact
so
fine
and
simple
that
it
knocked
me
silly
to
think
i
never
realised
it
before
i
had
read
it
yes
but
now
i
it
the
earth
the
whole
bustling
universe
was
nothing
after
all
but
a
visible
production
of
eternal
living
powers
spiritual
powers
mind
you
that
just
happened
to
include
the
particular
little
type
of
strutting
creature
we
called
mankind
and
these
powers
as
seen
in
nature
were
the
gods
it
was
our
refusal
of
their
grand
appeal
so
wild
and
sweet
and
beautiful
that
caused
evil
it
was
this
barrier
between
ourselves
and
the
rest
of
my
thoughts
and
feelings
swept
away
upon
the
rising
flood
as
the
figure
came
upon
me
like
a
shaft
of
moonlight
melting
the
last
remnant
of
opposition
that
was
in
me
i
took
my
brain
my
reason
chucking
them
aside
for
the
futile
little
mechanism
i
suddenly
saw
them
to
be
in
place
of
them
came
oh
god
i
hate
to
say
it
for
only
nursery
talk
can
get
within
a
mile
of
it
and
yet
what
i
need
is
something
simpler
even
than
the
words
that
children
use
under
one
arm
i
carried
a
whole
forest
breathing
in
the
wind
and
beneath
the
other
a
hundred
meadows
full
of
singing
streams
with
golden
marigolds
and
blue
along
their
banks
upon
my
back
and
shoulders
lay
the
clouded
hills
with
dew
and
moonlight
in
their
brimmed
capacious
hollows
thick
in
my
hair
hung
the
unaging
powers
that
are
stars
and
sunlight
though
the
sun
was
far
away
it
sweetened
the
currents
of
my
blood
with
liquid
gold
breast
and
throat
and
face
as
i
advanced
met
all
the
rivers
of
the
world
and
all
the
winds
of
heaven
their
strength
and
swiftness
melting
into
me
as
light
melts
into
everything
it
touches
and
into
my
eyes
passed
all
the
radiant
colours
that
weave
the
cloth
of
nature
as
she
takes
the
sun
and
this
figure
pouring
upon
me
like
a
burst
of
moonlight
spoke
they
all
are
in
you
air
and
fire
and
water
and
i
my
feet
stand
on
the
my
own
voice
interrupted
deep
power
lifting
through
the
sound
of
it
the
earth
he
laughed
gigantically
he
spread
he
seemed
everywhere
about
me
he
seemed
a
race
of
men
my
life
swam
forth
in
waves
of
some
immense
sensation
that
issued
from
the
mountain
and
the
forest
then
returned
to
them
again
i
reeled
i
clutched
at
something
in
me
that
was
slipping
beyond
control
slipping
down
a
bank
towards
a
deep
dark
river
flowing
at
my
feet
a
shadowy
boat
appeared
a
still
more
shadowy
outline
at
the
helm
i
was
in
the
act
of
stepping
into
it
for
the
tree
i
caught
at
was
only
air
i
could
stop
myself
i
tried
to
scream
you
have
plucked
asphodel
sang
the
voice
beside
me
and
you
shall
pluck
more
i
slipped
and
slipped
the
speed
increasing
horribly
then
something
caught
as
though
a
cog
held
fast
and
stopped
me
i
remembered
my
business
in
new
york
city
arthur
i
yelled
arthur
i
shouted
again
as
hard
as
i
could
shout
there
was
frantic
terror
in
me
i
felt
as
though
i
should
never
get
back
to
myself
again
death
the
answer
came
in
his
normal
voice
keep
close
to
me
i
know
the
way
the
scenery
dwindled
suddenly
the
trees
came
back
i
was
walking
in
the
forest
beside
my
nephew
and
the
moonlight
lay
in
patches
and
little
shafts
of
silver
the
crests
of
the
pines
just
murmured
in
a
wind
that
scarcely
stirred
and
through
an
opening
on
our
right
i
saw
the
deep
valley
clasped
about
the
twinkling
village
lights
towering
in
splendour
the
spectral
snowfields
hung
upon
the
sky
huge
summits
guarding
them
and
arthur
took
my
arm
oh
solidly
enough
this
time
thank
heaven
he
asked
no
questions
of
me
there
a
smell
of
myrrh
he
whispered
and
we
are
very
near
the
undying
ancient
things
i
said
something
about
the
resin
from
the
trees
but
he
took
no
notice
it
enclosed
its
body
in
an
egg
of
myrrh
he
went
on
smiling
down
at
me
then
setting
it
on
fire
rose
from
the
ashes
with
its
life
renewed
once
every
five
hundred
years
you
see
what
did
i
cried
feeling
that
loss
of
self
stealing
over
me
again
and
his
answer
came
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
the
phoenix
they
called
it
a
bird
but
of
course
the
true
but
my
life
insured
in
that
i
cried
for
he
had
named
the
company
that
took
large
yearly
premiums
from
me
and
i
pay
your
life
insured
in
he
said
quietly
waving
his
arms
to
indicate
the
earth
your
love
of
nature
and
your
sympathy
with
it
make
you
safe
he
gazed
at
me
there
was
a
marvellous
expression
in
his
eyes
i
understood
why
poets
talked
of
stars
and
flowers
in
a
human
face
but
behind
the
face
crept
back
another
look
as
well
there
grew
about
his
figure
an
indeterminate
extension
the
outline
of
malahide
again
stirred
through
his
own
a
pale
delicate
hand
reached
out
to
take
my
own
and
something
broke
in
me
i
was
conscious
of
two
things
a
burst
of
joy
that
meant
losing
myself
entirely
and
a
rush
of
terror
that
meant
staying
as
i
was
a
small
painful
struggling
item
of
individual
life
another
spray
of
that
awful
asphodel
fell
fluttering
through
the
air
in
front
of
my
face
it
rested
on
the
earth
against
my
feet
and
arthur
this
weirdly
changing
arthur
stooped
to
pick
it
for
me
i
kicked
it
with
my
foot
beyond
his
reach
then
turned
and
ran
as
though
the
furies
of
that
ancient
world
were
after
me
i
ran
for
my
very
life
how
i
escaped
from
that
thick
wood
without
banging
my
body
to
bits
against
the
trees
i
explain
i
ran
from
something
i
desired
and
yet
feared
i
leaped
along
in
a
succession
of
flying
bounds
each
tree
i
passed
turned
of
its
own
accord
and
flung
after
me
until
the
entire
forest
followed
but
i
got
out
i
reached
the
open
upon
the
sloping
field
in
the
full
clear
light
of
the
moon
i
collapsed
in
a
panting
heap
the
earth
drew
back
with
a
great
shuddering
sigh
behind
me
there
was
this
strange
tumultuous
sound
upon
the
night
i
lay
beneath
the
open
heavens
that
were
full
of
moonlight
i
was
myself
but
there
were
tears
in
me
beauty
too
high
for
understanding
had
slipped
between
my
fingers
i
had
lost
malahide
i
had
lost
the
gods
of
earth
yet
i
had
seen
and
felt
i
had
not
lost
all
something
remained
that
i
could
never
lose
again
i
do
know
how
it
happened
exactly
but
presently
i
heard
arthur
saying
you
catch
your
death
of
cold
if
you
lie
on
that
soaking
grass
and
felt
his
hand
seize
mine
to
pull
me
to
my
feet
i
feel
safer
on
earth
i
believe
i
answered
and
then
he
said
yes
but
it
such
a
stupid
way
to
die
a
chill
i
got
up
then
and
we
went
downhill
together
towards
the
village
lights
i
danced
oh
i
admit
it
i
sang
as
well
there
was
a
flood
of
joy
and
power
about
me
that
beat
anything
i
ever
felt
before
i
did
think
or
hesitate
there
was
no
i
just
let
it
rip
for
all
there
was
and
if
there
had
been
ten
thousand
people
there
in
front
of
me
i
could
have
made
them
feel
it
too
that
was
the
kind
of
feeling
power
and
confidence
and
a
sort
of
raging
happiness
i
think
i
know
what
it
was
too
i
say
this
soberly
with
reverence
all
wool
and
no
fading
there
was
a
bit
of
god
in
me
god
power
that
drives
the
earth
and
pours
through
nature
the
imperishable
beauty
expressed
in
those
and
the
fear
i
felt
was
nothing
but
the
little
tickling
point
of
losing
my
ordinary
self
the
dread
of
letting
go
the
shrinking
before
the
plunge
what
a
fellow
feels
when
he
falling
in
love
and
hesitates
and
tries
to
think
it
out
and
hold
back
and
is
afraid
to
let
the
enormous
tide
flow
in
and
drown
him
oh
yes
i
began
to
think
it
over
a
bit
as
we
raced
down
the
that
glorious
night
i
read
some
in
my
day
my
all
right
i
heard
of
dual
personality
and
subliminal
uprush
and
conversion
no
new
line
of
goods
all
that
but
somehow
these
stunts
of
the
psychologists
and
philosophers
did
cut
any
ice
with
me
just
then
because
i
what
they
merely
and
explanation
was
just
a
bargain
sale
the
best
things
ca
be
explained
at
all
there
no
real
value
in
a
bargain
sale
arthur
had
trouble
to
keep
up
with
me
we
were
running
due
east
and
the
earth
was
turning
therefore
with
us
we
all
three
ran
together
at
pace
terrific
the
moonlight
danced
along
the
summits
and
the
flew
like
spreading
robes
and
the
forests
everywhere
far
and
near
hung
watching
us
and
booming
like
a
thousand
organs
there
were
uncaged
winds
about
you
could
hear
them
whistling
among
the
precipices
but
the
great
thing
that
i
knew
was
beauty
a
beauty
of
the
common
old
familiar
earth
and
a
beauty
that
stayed
with
me
ever
since
and
given
me
joy
and
strength
and
a
source
of
power
and
delight
i
never
guessed
existed
before
as
we
dropped
lower
into
the
thicker
air
of
the
valley
i
sobered
down
gradually
the
ecstasy
passed
from
me
we
slowed
up
a
bit
the
lights
and
the
houses
and
the
sight
of
the
hotel
where
people
were
dancing
in
a
stuffy
ballroom
all
this
put
on
something
that
had
been
flowing
now
you
think
this
an
odd
thing
too
but
when
we
reached
the
village
street
i
just
took
arthur
hand
and
shook
it
and
said
and
went
up
to
bed
and
slept
like
a
till
morning
and
from
that
day
to
this
i
never
set
eyes
on
the
boy
again
perhaps
it
difficult
to
explain
and
perhaps
it
is
i
can
explain
it
to
myself
in
two
lines
i
was
afraid
to
see
him
i
was
afraid
he
might
explain
i
was
afraid
he
might
explain
away
i
just
left
a
note
he
never
replied
to
it
and
went
off
by
a
morning
train
can
you
understand
that
because
if
you
ca
you
have
understood
this
account
i
tried
to
give
of
the
experience
arthur
gave
me
well
anyway
i
just
let
it
go
at
that
arthur
a
director
now
in
his
father
wholesale
chemical
business
and
i
well
i
doing
better
than
ever
in
the
buying
and
selling
of
exchange
between
banks
in
new
york
city
as
before
but
when
i
said
i
was
still
drawing
dividends
on
my
swiss
investment
i
meant
it
and
it
not
scenery
everybody
gets
a
thrill
from
scenery
it
a
darned
sight
more
than
that
it
those
little
wayward
patches
of
blue
on
a
cloudy
day
those
blue
pools
in
the
sky
just
above
trinity
church
steeple
when
i
pass
out
of
wall
street
into
lower
broadway
it
the
rustle
of
the
among
the
battery
trees
the
wash
of
the
waves
when
the
ferry
starting
for
staten
island
and
the
glint
of
the
sun
far
down
the
bay
or
dropping
a
bit
of
pearl
into
the
old
east
river
and
sometimes
it
the
strip
of
cloud
in
the
west
above
the
jersey
shore
of
the
hudson
the
first
star
the
sickle
of
the
new
moon
behind
the
masts
and
shipping
but
usually
something
nearer
bigger
simpler
than
all
or
any
of
these
it
just
the
certainty
that
when
i
hurry
along
the
hard
stone
pavements
from
bank
to
bank
i
walking
on
the
earth
it
just
that
v
a
desert
episode
better
put
wraps
on
now
the
sun
getting
low
a
girl
said
it
was
the
end
of
a
day
expedition
in
the
arabian
desert
and
they
were
having
tea
a
few
yards
away
the
donkeys
munched
their
beside
them
in
the
sand
the
boys
lay
finishing
bread
and
jam
immense
with
gliding
tread
the
sun
rays
slid
from
crest
to
crest
of
the
limestone
ridges
that
broke
the
huge
expanse
towards
the
red
sea
by
the
time
the
were
packed
the
sun
hovered
a
giant
ball
of
red
above
the
pyramids
it
stood
in
the
western
sky
a
moment
looking
out
of
its
majestic
hood
across
the
sand
with
a
movement
almost
visible
it
leaped
paused
then
leaped
again
it
seemed
to
bound
towards
the
horizon
then
suddenly
was
gone
it
cold
yes
said
the
painter
rivers
and
all
who
heard
looked
up
at
him
because
of
the
way
he
said
it
a
hurried
movement
ran
through
the
merry
party
and
the
girls
were
on
their
donkeys
quickly
not
wishing
to
be
left
to
bring
up
the
rear
they
clattered
off
the
boys
cried
the
thud
of
sticks
was
heard
hoofs
shuffled
through
the
sand
and
stones
in
single
file
the
picnickers
headed
for
helouan
some
five
miles
distant
and
the
desert
closed
up
behind
them
as
they
went
following
in
a
shadowy
wave
that
never
broke
noiseless
foamless
unstreaked
driven
by
no
wind
and
of
a
volume
undiscoverable
against
the
orange
sunset
the
pyramids
turned
deep
purple
the
strip
of
silvery
nile
among
its
palm
trees
looked
like
rising
mist
in
the
incredible
egyptian
afterglow
the
enormous
horizons
burned
a
little
longer
then
went
out
the
ball
of
the
earth
a
huge
round
globe
that
bulged
curved
visibly
as
at
sea
it
was
no
longer
a
flat
expanse
it
turned
its
splendid
curves
were
realised
better
put
wraps
on
it
cold
and
the
sun
is
low
and
then
the
curious
hurry
to
get
back
among
the
houses
and
the
haunts
of
men
no
more
was
said
perhaps
than
this
yet
the
time
and
place
being
what
they
were
the
mind
became
suddenly
aware
of
that
quality
which
ever
brings
a
certain
shrinking
with
it
vastness
and
more
than
vastness
that
which
is
endless
because
it
is
also
beginningless
eternity
a
colossal
splendour
stole
upon
the
heart
and
the
senses
unaccustomed
to
the
unusual
stretch
reeled
a
little
as
though
the
wonder
was
more
than
could
be
faced
with
comfort
not
all
doubtless
realised
it
though
to
two
at
least
it
came
with
a
staggering
impact
there
was
no
withstanding
for
while
the
luminous
greys
and
purples
crept
round
them
from
the
sandy
wastes
the
hearts
of
these
two
became
aware
of
certain
common
things
whose
simple
majesty
is
usually
dulled
by
mere
familiarity
neither
the
man
nor
the
girl
knew
for
certain
that
the
other
felt
it
as
they
brought
up
the
rear
together
yet
the
fact
that
each
feel
it
set
them
side
by
side
in
the
same
strange
circle
and
made
them
silent
they
realised
the
immensity
of
a
moment
the
dizzy
stretch
of
time
that
led
up
to
the
casual
pinning
of
a
veil
to
the
tightening
of
a
stirrup
strap
to
the
little
speech
with
a
companion
the
roar
of
the
vanished
centuries
that
have
ground
mountains
into
sand
and
spread
them
over
the
floor
of
africa
above
all
to
the
little
truth
that
they
themselves
existed
amid
the
whirl
of
stupendous
systems
all
delicately
balanced
as
a
spider
web
that
they
were
for
a
moment
this
vast
scale
of
reality
revealed
itself
then
hid
swiftly
again
behind
the
débris
of
the
obvious
the
universe
containing
their
two
tiny
yet
important
selves
stood
still
for
an
instant
before
their
eyes
they
looked
at
it
realised
that
they
belonged
to
it
everything
moved
and
had
its
being
here
in
this
silent
empty
desert
even
more
actively
than
in
a
city
of
crowded
houses
the
quiet
nile
sighing
with
age
passed
down
towards
the
sea
there
loomed
the
menacing
pyramids
across
the
twilight
beneath
them
in
monstrous
dignity
crouched
that
shadow
from
whose
eyes
of
battered
stone
proceeds
the
nameless
thing
that
contracts
the
heart
then
opens
it
again
to
terror
and
everywhere
from
towering
monoliths
as
from
secret
tombs
rose
that
strange
long
whisper
which
defying
time
and
distance
laughs
at
death
the
spell
of
egypt
which
is
the
spell
of
immortality
touched
their
hearts
already
as
the
group
of
picnickers
rode
homewards
now
the
first
stars
twinkled
overhead
and
the
peerless
egyptian
night
was
on
the
way
there
was
hurry
in
the
passing
of
the
dusk
and
the
cold
sensibly
increased
so
you
did
no
painting
after
all
said
rivers
to
the
girl
who
rode
a
little
in
front
of
him
for
i
never
saw
you
touch
your
once
they
were
some
distance
now
behind
the
others
the
line
straggled
and
when
no
answer
came
he
quickened
his
pace
drew
up
alongside
and
saw
that
her
eyes
in
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
shone
with
moisture
but
she
turned
her
head
a
little
smiling
into
his
face
so
that
the
human
and
the
beauty
came
over
him
with
an
onset
that
was
almost
shock
neither
one
nor
other
he
knew
were
long
for
him
and
the
realisation
fell
upon
him
with
a
pang
of
actual
physical
pain
the
acuteness
the
hopelessness
of
the
realisation
for
a
moment
were
more
than
he
could
bear
stern
of
temper
though
he
was
and
he
tried
to
pass
in
front
of
her
urging
his
donkey
with
resounding
strokes
her
own
animal
however
following
the
lead
at
once
came
up
with
him
you
felt
it
perhaps
as
i
did
he
said
some
moments
later
his
voice
quite
steady
again
the
stupendous
everlasting
thing
the
behind
it
all
he
hesitated
a
little
in
his
speech
unable
to
find
the
substantive
that
could
compass
even
a
fragment
of
his
thought
she
paused
too
similarly
inarticulate
before
the
surge
of
incomprehensible
feelings
it
awful
she
said
half
laughing
yet
the
tone
hushed
and
a
little
quaver
in
it
somewhere
and
her
voice
to
his
was
like
the
first
sound
he
had
ever
heard
in
the
world
for
the
first
sound
a
man
heard
in
the
world
would
be
beyond
all
telling
magical
i
shall
not
try
again
she
continued
leaving
out
the
laughter
this
time
my
is
a
farce
for
to
tell
the
truth
and
the
next
three
words
she
said
below
her
breath
i
dare
not
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
for
a
second
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
following
wave
had
caught
them
up
and
was
about
to
break
above
her
too
but
the
hat
and
the
streaming
veil
shrouded
her
features
he
saw
instead
the
universe
he
felt
as
though
he
and
she
had
always
always
been
together
and
always
always
would
be
separation
was
inconceivable
it
came
so
close
she
whispered
it
shook
me
they
were
cut
off
from
their
companions
whose
voices
sounded
far
ahead
her
words
might
have
been
spoken
by
the
darkness
or
by
some
one
who
peered
at
them
from
within
that
following
wave
yet
the
fanciful
phrase
was
better
than
any
he
could
find
from
the
immeasurable
space
of
time
and
distance
men
hearts
vainly
seek
to
plumb
it
drew
into
closer
perspective
a
certain
meaning
that
words
may
hardly
compass
a
formidable
truth
that
belongs
to
that
deep
place
where
hope
and
doubt
fight
their
incessant
battle
the
awe
she
spoke
of
was
the
awe
of
immortality
of
belonging
to
something
that
is
endless
and
beginningless
and
he
understood
that
the
tears
and
laughter
were
one
caused
by
that
spell
which
takes
a
little
human
life
and
shakes
it
as
an
animal
shakes
its
prey
that
later
shall
feed
its
blood
and
increase
its
power
of
growth
his
other
thoughts
really
but
a
single
thought
he
had
not
the
right
to
utter
pain
this
time
easily
routed
hope
as
the
wave
came
nearer
for
it
was
the
wave
of
death
that
would
shortly
break
he
knew
over
him
but
not
over
her
him
it
would
sweep
with
its
huge
withdrawal
into
the
desert
whence
it
came
her
it
would
leave
high
upon
the
shores
of
life
alone
and
yet
the
separation
would
somehow
not
be
real
they
were
together
in
eternity
even
now
they
were
endless
as
this
desert
beginningless
as
this
sky
immortal
the
realisation
overwhelmed
the
lights
of
helouan
seemed
to
come
no
nearer
as
they
rode
on
in
silence
for
the
rest
of
the
way
against
the
dark
background
of
the
mokattam
hills
these
fairy
lights
twinkled
brightly
hanging
in
but
after
an
hour
they
were
no
closer
than
before
it
was
like
riding
towards
the
stars
it
would
take
centuries
to
reach
them
there
were
centuries
in
which
to
do
so
hurry
has
no
place
in
the
desert
it
is
born
in
streets
the
desert
stands
still
to
go
fast
in
it
is
to
go
backwards
now
in
particular
its
enormous
uncanny
leisure
was
everywhere
in
keeping
with
that
mighty
scale
the
sunset
had
made
visible
his
thoughts
like
the
steps
of
the
weary
animal
that
bore
him
had
no
progress
in
them
the
serpent
of
eternity
holding
its
tail
in
its
own
mouth
rose
from
the
sand
enclosing
himself
the
stars
and
her
behind
him
in
the
hollows
of
that
shadowy
wave
the
procession
of
dynasties
and
conquests
the
great
series
of
gorgeous
civilisations
the
mind
calls
past
stood
still
crowded
with
shining
eyes
and
beckoning
faces
still
waiting
to
arrive
there
is
no
death
in
egypt
his
own
death
stood
so
close
that
he
could
touch
it
by
stretching
out
his
hand
yet
it
seemed
as
much
behind
as
in
front
of
him
what
man
called
a
beginning
was
a
trick
there
was
no
such
thing
he
was
with
this
girl
when
death
waited
so
close
for
him
yet
he
had
never
really
begun
their
lives
ran
always
parallel
the
hand
he
stretched
to
clasp
approaching
death
caught
instead
in
this
girl
shadowy
hair
drawing
her
in
with
him
to
the
centre
where
he
breathed
the
eternity
of
the
desert
yet
expression
of
any
sort
was
as
futile
as
it
was
unnecessary
to
paint
to
speak
to
sing
even
the
slightest
gesture
of
the
soul
became
a
crude
and
foolish
thing
silence
was
here
the
truth
and
they
rode
in
silence
towards
the
fairy
lights
then
suddenly
the
rocky
ground
rose
up
close
before
them
boulders
stood
out
vividly
with
black
shadows
and
shining
heads
a
house
slid
by
three
palm
trees
rattled
in
the
evening
wind
beyond
a
mosque
and
minaret
sailed
upwards
like
the
spars
and
rigging
of
some
phantom
craft
and
the
colonnades
of
the
great
modern
hotel
standing
upon
its
dome
of
limestone
ridge
loomed
over
them
helouan
was
about
them
before
they
knew
it
the
desert
lay
behind
with
its
huge
arrested
billow
slowly
owing
to
its
prodigious
volume
yet
with
a
speed
that
merged
it
instantly
with
the
far
horizon
behind
the
night
this
wave
now
withdrew
a
little
there
was
no
hurry
it
came
for
the
moment
no
farther
rivers
knew
for
he
was
in
it
to
the
throat
only
his
head
was
above
the
surface
he
still
could
breathe
and
speak
and
see
deepening
with
every
hour
into
an
incalculable
splendour
it
waited
in
the
street
the
foremost
riders
drew
rein
and
two
and
two
abreast
the
long
line
clattered
past
the
shops
and
cafés
the
railway
station
and
hotels
stared
at
by
the
natives
from
the
busy
pavements
the
donkeys
stumbled
blinded
by
the
electric
light
girls
in
white
dresses
flitted
here
and
there
arabîyehs
rattled
past
with
people
hurrying
home
to
dress
for
dinner
and
the
evening
train
just
in
from
cairo
disgorged
its
stream
of
passengers
there
were
dances
in
several
of
the
hotels
that
night
voices
rose
on
all
sides
questions
and
answers
engagements
and
appointments
were
made
little
plans
and
plots
and
intrigues
for
seizing
happiness
on
the
wing
before
the
wave
rolled
in
and
caught
the
lot
they
chattered
gaily
you
going
are
you
you
promised
of
course
i
am
then
i
drive
you
over
may
i
call
for
you
all
right
come
at
ten
we
sha
have
finished
our
bridge
by
then
say
and
eyes
exchanged
their
meaning
signals
the
group
dismounted
and
dispersed
arabs
standing
under
the
lebbekh
trees
or
squatting
on
the
pavements
before
their
booths
watched
them
with
faces
of
gleaming
bronze
rivers
gave
his
bridle
to
a
and
moved
across
stiffly
after
the
long
ride
to
help
the
girl
dismount
you
feel
tired
he
asked
gently
it
been
a
long
day
for
her
face
was
white
as
chalk
though
the
eyes
shone
brilliantly
tired
perhaps
she
answered
but
exhilarated
too
i
should
like
to
be
there
now
i
should
like
to
go
back
this
minute
if
some
one
would
take
me
and
though
she
said
it
lightly
there
was
a
meaning
in
her
voice
he
apparently
chose
to
disregard
it
was
as
if
she
knew
his
secret
will
you
take
me
some
day
soon
the
direct
question
spoken
by
those
determined
little
lips
was
impossible
to
ignore
he
looked
close
into
her
face
as
he
helped
her
from
the
saddle
with
a
spring
that
brought
her
a
moment
half
into
his
arms
some
day
soon
i
will
he
said
with
emphasis
when
you
are
ready
the
pallor
in
her
face
and
a
certain
expression
in
it
he
had
not
known
before
startled
him
i
think
you
have
been
overdoing
it
he
added
with
a
tone
in
which
authority
and
love
were
oddly
mingled
neither
of
them
disguised
like
yourself
she
smiled
shaking
her
skirts
out
and
looking
down
at
her
dusty
shoes
i
only
a
few
days
more
before
i
sail
we
both
in
such
a
hurry
but
you
are
the
worst
of
the
two
because
my
time
is
even
shorter
ran
his
horrified
thought
for
he
said
no
word
she
raised
her
eyes
suddenly
to
his
with
an
expression
that
for
an
instant
almost
convinced
him
she
had
guessed
and
the
soul
in
him
stood
rigidly
at
attention
urging
back
the
rising
fires
the
hair
had
dropped
loosely
round
the
neck
her
face
was
level
with
his
shoulder
even
the
glare
of
the
street
lights
could
not
make
her
undesirable
but
behind
the
gaze
of
the
deep
brown
eyes
another
thing
looked
forth
imperatively
into
his
own
and
he
recognised
it
with
a
rush
of
terror
yet
of
singular
exultation
it
followed
us
all
the
way
she
whispered
it
came
after
us
from
the
desert
where
it
at
the
houses
he
said
equally
low
it
stopped
he
gladly
adopted
her
syncopated
speech
for
it
helped
him
in
his
struggle
to
subdue
those
rising
fires
for
a
second
she
hesitated
you
mean
if
we
had
not
left
so
soon
when
it
turned
cold
if
we
had
not
hurried
if
we
had
remained
a
little
longer
he
caught
at
her
hand
unable
to
control
himself
but
dropped
it
again
the
same
second
while
she
made
as
though
she
had
not
noticed
forgiving
him
with
her
eyes
or
a
great
deal
longer
she
added
slowly
for
ever
and
then
he
was
certain
that
she
guessed
not
that
he
loved
her
above
all
else
in
the
world
for
that
was
so
obvious
that
a
child
might
know
it
but
that
his
silence
was
due
to
his
other
lesser
secret
that
the
great
executioner
stood
waiting
to
drop
the
hood
about
his
eyes
he
was
already
pinioned
something
in
her
gaze
and
in
her
manner
persuaded
him
suddenly
that
she
understood
his
exhilaration
increased
extraordinarily
i
mean
he
said
very
quietly
that
the
spell
weakens
here
among
the
houses
and
among
the
living
there
was
masterfulness
triumph
in
his
voice
very
wonderfully
he
saw
her
smile
change
she
drew
slightly
closer
to
his
side
as
though
unable
to
resist
mingled
with
lesser
things
we
should
not
understand
completely
he
added
softly
and
that
might
be
a
mistake
you
mean
she
asked
quickly
her
face
grave
again
it
was
his
turn
to
hesitate
a
moment
the
breeze
stirred
the
hair
about
her
neck
bringing
its
faint
perfume
perfume
of
young
life
to
his
nostrils
he
drew
his
breath
in
deeply
smothering
back
the
torrent
of
rising
words
he
knew
were
unpermissible
misunderstanding
he
said
briefly
if
the
eye
be
single
he
broke
off
shaken
by
a
paroxysm
of
coughing
you
know
my
meaning
he
continued
as
soon
as
the
attack
had
passed
you
feel
the
difference
pointing
round
him
to
the
hotels
the
shops
the
busy
stream
of
people
the
hurry
the
excitement
the
feverish
blinding
child
play
which
pretends
to
be
alive
but
does
not
know
it
and
again
the
coughing
stopped
him
this
time
she
took
his
hand
in
her
own
pressed
it
very
slightly
then
released
it
he
felt
it
as
the
touch
of
that
desert
wave
upon
his
soul
the
reception
must
be
in
complete
and
utter
resignation
tainted
by
lesser
things
the
disharmony
might
be
he
began
stammeringly
again
there
came
interruption
as
the
rest
of
the
party
called
impatiently
to
know
if
they
were
coming
up
to
the
hotel
he
had
not
time
to
find
the
completing
adjective
perhaps
he
could
not
find
it
ever
perhaps
it
does
not
exist
in
any
modern
language
eternity
is
not
realised
men
have
no
time
to
know
they
are
alive
for
ever
they
are
too
busy
they
all
moved
in
a
clattering
merry
group
towards
the
big
hotel
rivers
and
the
girl
were
separated
there
was
a
dance
that
evening
but
neither
of
these
took
part
in
it
in
the
great
their
tables
were
far
apart
he
could
not
even
see
her
across
the
sea
of
intervening
heads
and
shoulders
the
long
meal
over
he
went
to
his
room
feeling
it
imperative
to
be
alone
he
did
not
read
he
did
not
write
but
leaving
the
light
unlit
he
wrapped
himself
up
and
leaned
out
upon
the
broad
into
the
great
egyptian
night
his
thoughts
like
to
the
crowding
stars
stood
still
yet
for
ever
took
new
shapes
he
tried
to
see
behind
them
as
when
a
boy
he
had
tried
to
see
behind
the
constellations
out
into
space
where
there
is
nothing
below
him
the
lights
of
helouan
twinkled
like
the
pleiades
reflected
in
a
pool
of
water
a
hum
of
queer
soft
noises
rose
to
his
ears
but
just
beyond
the
houses
the
desert
stood
at
attention
the
vastest
thing
he
had
ever
known
very
stern
yet
very
comforting
with
its
peace
beyond
all
comprehension
its
delicate
wild
terror
and
its
awful
message
of
immortality
and
the
attitude
of
his
mind
though
he
did
not
know
it
was
one
of
prayer
from
time
to
time
he
went
to
lie
on
the
bed
with
paroxysms
of
coughing
he
had
overtaxed
his
strength
his
swiftly
fading
strength
the
wave
had
risen
to
his
lips
nearer
forty
than
paul
rivers
had
come
out
to
egypt
plainly
understanding
that
with
the
greatest
care
he
might
last
a
few
weeks
longer
than
if
he
stayed
in
england
a
few
more
times
to
see
the
sunset
and
the
sunrise
to
watch
the
stars
feel
the
soft
airs
of
earth
upon
his
cheeks
a
few
more
days
of
intercourse
with
his
kind
asking
and
answering
questions
wearing
the
old
familiar
clothes
he
loved
reading
his
favourite
pages
and
then
out
into
the
big
spaces
where
there
is
nothing
yet
no
one
from
his
stalwart
energetic
figure
would
have
guessed
no
one
but
the
expert
mind
not
to
be
deceived
to
whom
in
the
first
attack
of
overwhelming
despair
and
desolation
he
went
for
final
advice
he
left
that
house
as
many
had
left
it
before
knowing
that
soon
he
would
need
no
earthly
protection
of
roof
and
walls
and
that
his
soul
if
it
existed
would
be
shelterless
in
the
space
behind
all
manifested
life
he
had
looked
forward
to
fame
and
position
in
this
world
had
indeed
already
achieved
the
first
step
towards
this
end
and
now
with
the
vanity
of
all
earthly
aims
so
mercilessly
clear
before
him
he
had
turned
in
somewhat
of
a
nervous
concentrated
hurry
to
make
terms
with
the
infinite
while
still
the
brain
was
there
and
had
of
course
found
nothing
for
it
takes
a
lifetime
crowded
with
experiment
and
effort
to
learn
even
the
alphabet
of
genuine
faith
and
what
could
come
of
a
few
weeks
wild
questioning
but
confusion
and
bewilderment
of
mind
it
was
inevitable
he
came
out
to
egypt
wondering
thinking
questioning
but
chiefly
wondering
he
had
grown
that
is
more
childlike
abandoning
the
futile
tool
of
reason
which
hitherto
had
seemed
to
him
the
perfect
instrument
its
foolishness
stood
naked
before
him
in
the
pitiless
light
of
the
specialist
decision
for
who
can
by
searching
find
out
god
to
be
exceedingly
careful
of
was
the
final
warning
he
brought
with
him
and
within
a
few
hours
of
his
arrival
three
weeks
ago
he
had
met
this
girl
and
utterly
disregarded
it
he
took
it
somewhat
thus
instead
of
lingering
i
enjoy
myself
and
go
out
a
little
sooner
i
the
time
is
very
short
his
was
not
a
nature
anyhow
that
could
heed
a
warning
he
could
not
kneel
upright
and
unflinching
he
went
to
meet
things
as
they
came
reckless
unwise
but
certainly
not
afraid
and
this
characteristic
operated
now
he
ran
to
meet
death
full
tilt
in
the
uncharted
spaces
that
lay
behind
the
stars
with
love
for
a
companion
now
he
raced
his
speed
increasing
from
day
to
day
she
as
he
thought
knowing
merely
that
he
sought
her
but
had
not
guessed
his
darker
secret
that
was
now
his
secret
and
in
the
desert
this
afternoon
of
the
picnic
the
great
thing
he
sped
to
meet
had
shown
itself
with
its
familiar
touch
of
appalling
cold
and
shadow
familiar
because
all
minds
know
of
and
accept
it
appalling
because
until
realised
close
and
with
the
mental
power
at
the
full
it
remains
but
a
name
the
heart
refuses
to
believe
in
and
he
had
discovered
that
its
name
was
life
rivers
had
seen
the
wave
that
sweeps
incessant
tireless
but
as
a
rule
invisible
round
the
great
curve
of
the
bulging
earth
brushing
the
nations
into
the
deeps
behind
it
had
followed
him
home
to
the
streets
and
houses
of
helouan
he
saw
it
as
he
leaned
from
his
window
dim
and
immense
too
huge
to
break
its
beauty
was
nameless
undecipherable
his
coughing
echoed
back
from
the
wall
of
its
great
sides
and
the
music
floated
up
at
the
same
time
from
the
in
the
opposite
wing
the
two
sounds
mingled
life
which
is
love
and
death
which
is
their
unchanging
partner
held
hands
beneath
the
stars
he
leaned
out
farther
to
drink
in
the
cool
sweet
air
soon
on
this
air
his
body
would
be
dust
driven
perhaps
against
her
very
cheek
trodden
on
possibly
by
her
little
foot
until
in
turn
she
joined
him
too
blown
by
the
same
wind
loose
about
the
desert
true
yet
at
the
same
time
they
would
always
be
together
always
somewhere
side
by
side
continuing
in
the
vast
universe
this
new
absolute
conviction
was
in
him
now
he
remembered
the
curious
sweet
perfume
in
the
desert
as
of
flowers
where
yet
no
flowers
are
it
was
the
perfume
of
life
but
in
the
desert
there
is
no
life
living
things
that
grow
and
move
and
utter
are
but
a
protest
against
death
in
the
desert
they
are
unnecessary
because
death
there
not
its
overwhelming
vitality
needs
no
insolent
visible
proof
no
protest
no
challenge
no
little
signs
of
life
the
message
of
the
desert
is
immortality
he
went
finally
to
bed
just
before
midnight
hovering
magnificently
just
outside
his
window
death
watched
him
while
he
slept
the
wave
crept
to
the
level
of
his
eyes
he
called
her
name
and
downstairs
meanwhile
the
girl
knowing
nothing
wondered
where
he
was
wondered
unhappily
and
restlessly
more
though
this
she
did
not
understand
wondered
motheringly
until
on
the
ride
home
and
from
their
singular
conversation
together
she
had
guessed
nothing
of
his
reason
for
being
at
helouan
where
so
many
come
in
order
to
find
life
she
only
knew
her
own
and
she
was
but
then
in
the
desert
when
that
touch
of
unearthly
chill
had
stolen
out
of
the
sand
towards
sunset
she
had
realised
clearly
astonished
she
had
not
seen
it
long
ago
that
this
man
loved
her
yet
that
something
prevented
his
obeying
the
great
impulse
in
the
life
of
paul
rivers
whose
presence
had
profoundly
stirred
her
heart
the
first
time
she
saw
him
there
was
some
obstacle
that
held
him
back
a
barrier
his
honour
must
respect
he
could
never
tell
her
of
his
love
it
could
lead
to
nothing
knowing
that
he
was
not
married
her
intuition
failed
her
utterly
at
first
then
in
their
silence
on
the
homeward
ride
the
truth
had
somehow
pressed
up
and
touched
her
with
its
hand
of
ice
in
that
disjointed
conversation
at
the
end
which
reads
as
it
sounded
as
though
no
coherent
meaning
lay
behind
the
words
and
as
though
both
sought
to
conceal
by
speech
what
yet
both
burned
to
utter
she
had
divined
his
darker
secret
and
knew
that
it
was
the
same
as
her
own
she
understood
then
it
was
death
that
had
tracked
them
from
the
desert
following
with
its
gigantic
shadow
from
the
sandy
wastes
the
cold
the
darkness
the
silence
which
can
not
answer
the
stupendous
mystery
which
is
the
spell
of
its
inscrutable
presence
had
risen
about
them
in
the
dusk
and
kept
them
company
at
a
little
distance
until
the
lights
of
helouan
had
bade
it
halt
life
which
may
not
can
not
end
had
frightened
her
his
time
perhaps
was
even
shorter
than
her
own
none
knew
his
secret
since
he
was
alone
in
egypt
and
was
caring
for
himself
similarly
since
she
bravely
kept
her
terror
to
herself
her
mother
had
no
inkling
of
her
own
aware
merely
that
the
disease
was
in
her
system
and
that
her
orders
were
to
be
extremely
cautious
this
couple
therefore
shared
secretly
together
the
two
clearest
glimpses
of
eternity
life
has
to
offer
to
the
soul
side
by
side
they
looked
into
the
splendid
eyes
of
love
and
death
life
moreover
with
its
instinct
for
simple
and
terrific
drama
had
produced
this
majestic
climax
breaking
with
pathos
at
the
very
moment
when
it
could
not
be
developed
this
side
of
the
stars
they
stood
together
upon
the
stage
a
stage
emptied
of
other
human
players
the
audience
had
gone
home
and
the
lights
were
being
lowered
no
music
sounded
the
critics
were
in
this
great
game
of
consequences
it
was
known
where
he
met
her
what
he
said
and
what
she
answered
possibly
what
they
did
and
even
what
the
world
thought
but
what
the
consequence
was
would
remain
unknown
untold
that
would
happen
in
the
big
spaces
of
which
the
desert
in
its
silence
its
motionless
serenity
its
shelterless
intolerable
vastness
is
the
perfect
symbol
and
the
desert
gives
no
answer
it
sounds
no
challenge
for
it
is
complete
life
in
the
desert
makes
no
sign
it
in
the
hotel
that
night
there
arrived
by
chance
a
famous
international
dancer
whose
dahabîyeh
lay
anchored
at
san
giovanni
in
the
nile
below
helouan
and
this
woman
with
her
party
had
come
to
dine
and
take
part
in
the
festivities
the
news
spread
after
twelve
the
lights
were
lowered
and
while
the
moonlight
flooded
the
terraces
streaming
past
pillar
and
colonnade
she
rendered
in
the
shadowed
halls
the
music
of
the
masters
interpreting
with
an
instinctive
genius
messages
which
are
eternal
and
divine
among
the
crowd
of
enthralled
and
delighted
guests
the
girl
sat
on
the
steps
and
watched
her
the
rhythmical
interpretation
held
a
power
that
seemed
in
a
sense
inspired
there
lay
in
it
a
certain
unconscious
something
that
was
pure
unearthly
something
that
the
stars
wheeling
in
stately
movements
over
the
sea
and
desert
know
something
the
great
winds
bring
to
mountains
where
they
play
together
something
the
forests
capture
and
fix
magically
into
their
gathering
of
big
and
little
branches
it
was
both
passionate
and
spiritual
wild
and
tender
intensely
human
and
seductively
for
it
was
original
taught
of
nature
a
revelation
of
naked
unhampered
life
it
comforted
as
the
desert
comforts
it
brought
the
desert
awe
into
the
stuffy
corridors
of
the
hotel
with
the
moonlight
and
the
whispering
of
stars
yet
behind
it
ever
the
silence
of
those
grey
mysterious
interminable
spaces
which
utter
to
themselves
the
wordless
song
of
life
for
it
was
the
same
dim
thing
she
felt
that
had
followed
her
from
the
desert
several
hours
before
halting
just
outside
the
streets
and
houses
as
though
blocked
from
further
advance
the
thing
that
had
stopped
her
foolish
painting
skilled
though
she
was
because
it
hides
behind
colour
and
not
in
it
the
thing
that
veiled
the
meaning
in
the
cryptic
sentences
she
and
he
had
stammered
out
together
the
thing
in
a
word
as
near
as
she
could
approach
it
by
any
means
of
interior
expression
that
the
realisation
of
death
for
the
first
time
makes
comprehensible
immortality
it
was
unutterable
but
it
he
and
she
were
indissolubly
together
death
was
no
separation
there
was
no
death
it
was
terrible
it
was
she
had
already
used
the
word
awful
full
of
awe
in
the
desert
thought
whispered
as
she
watched
spellbound
it
is
impossible
even
to
conceive
of
death
the
idea
is
meaningless
it
simply
is
not
the
music
and
the
movement
filled
the
air
with
life
which
being
there
must
continue
always
and
continuing
always
can
have
never
had
a
beginning
death
therefore
was
the
great
revealer
of
life
without
it
none
could
realise
that
they
are
alive
others
had
discovered
this
before
her
but
she
did
not
know
it
in
the
desert
no
one
can
realise
death
it
is
hope
and
life
that
are
the
only
certainty
the
entire
conception
of
the
egyptian
system
was
based
on
this
the
conviction
sure
and
glorious
of
life
endless
continuation
their
tombs
and
temples
their
pyramids
and
sphinxes
surviving
after
thousands
of
years
defy
the
passage
of
time
and
laugh
at
death
the
very
bodies
of
their
priests
and
kings
of
their
animals
even
their
fish
their
insects
stand
as
symbols
of
their
stalwart
knowledge
and
this
girl
as
she
listened
to
the
music
and
watched
the
inspired
dancing
remembered
it
the
message
poured
into
her
from
many
sides
though
the
desert
brought
it
clearest
with
death
peering
into
her
face
a
few
short
weeks
ahead
she
thought
instead
of
life
the
desert
as
it
were
became
for
her
a
little
fragment
of
eternity
focused
into
an
intelligible
point
for
her
mind
to
rest
upon
with
comfort
and
comprehension
her
steady
thoughtful
nature
stirred
towards
an
objective
far
beyond
the
small
enclosure
of
one
narrow
lifetime
the
scale
of
the
desert
stretched
her
to
the
grandeur
of
its
own
imperial
meaning
its
divine
repose
its
unassailable
and
everlasting
majesty
she
looked
beyond
the
wall
eternity
that
which
is
endless
without
pause
without
beginning
without
divisions
or
boundaries
the
fluttering
of
her
brave
yet
frightened
spirit
ceased
aware
with
awe
of
its
own
everlastingness
the
swiftest
motion
produces
the
effect
of
immobility
excessive
light
is
darkness
size
run
loose
into
enormity
is
the
same
as
the
minutely
tiny
similarly
in
the
desert
life
too
overwhelming
and
terrific
to
know
limit
or
confinement
lies
undetailed
and
stupendous
still
as
deity
a
revelation
of
nothingness
because
it
is
all
turned
golden
beneath
its
spell
that
the
music
and
the
rhythm
made
even
more
comprehensible
the
soul
in
her
already
lying
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
great
wave
sank
into
rest
and
peace
too
certain
of
itself
to
fear
and
panic
fled
away
i
am
immortal
because
i
and
what
i
love
is
not
apart
from
me
it
is
myself
we
are
together
endlessly
because
we
yet
in
reality
though
the
big
desert
brought
this
it
was
love
which
being
of
similar
parentage
interpreted
its
vast
meaning
to
her
little
heart
that
sudden
love
which
without
a
word
of
preface
or
explanation
had
come
to
her
a
short
three
weeks
before
she
went
up
to
her
room
soon
after
midnight
abruptly
unexpectedly
stricken
some
one
it
seemed
had
called
her
name
she
passed
his
door
the
lights
had
been
turned
up
the
clamour
of
praise
was
loud
round
the
figure
of
the
weary
dancer
as
she
left
in
a
carriage
for
her
dahabîyeh
on
the
nile
a
low
wind
whistled
round
the
walls
of
the
great
hotel
blowing
chill
and
bitter
between
the
pillars
of
the
colonnades
the
girl
heard
the
voices
float
up
to
her
through
the
night
and
once
more
behind
the
confused
sound
of
the
many
she
heard
her
own
name
called
but
more
faintly
than
before
and
from
very
far
away
it
came
through
the
spaces
beyond
her
open
window
it
died
away
again
then
but
for
the
sighing
of
that
bitter
wind
silence
the
deep
silence
of
the
desert
and
these
two
paul
rivers
and
the
girl
between
them
merely
a
floor
of
that
stone
that
built
the
pyramids
lay
a
few
moments
before
the
wave
of
sleep
engulfed
them
and
while
they
slept
two
shadowy
forms
hovered
above
the
roof
of
the
quiet
hotel
melting
presently
into
one
as
dreams
stole
down
from
the
desert
and
the
stars
immortality
whispered
to
them
on
either
side
rose
life
and
death
towering
in
splendour
love
joining
their
spreading
wings
fused
the
gigantic
outlines
into
one
the
figures
grew
smaller
comprehensible
they
entered
the
little
windows
above
the
beds
they
paused
a
moment
watching
waiting
and
then
like
a
wave
that
is
just
about
to
break
they
stooped
and
in
the
brilliant
egyptian
sunlight
of
the
morning
as
she
went
downstairs
she
passed
his
door
again
she
had
awakened
but
he
slept
on
he
had
preceded
her
it
was
next
day
she
learned
his
room
was
vacant
within
the
month
she
joined
him
and
within
the
year
the
cool
north
wind
that
sweetens
lower
egypt
from
the
sea
blew
the
dust
across
the
desert
as
before
it
is
the
dust
of
kings
of
queens
of
priests
princesses
lovers
it
is
the
dust
no
earthly
power
can
annihilate
it
too
lasts
for
ever
there
was
a
little
more
of
it
the
desert
message
slightly
added
to
immortality
vi
the
other
wing
it
used
to
puzzle
him
that
after
dark
some
one
look
in
round
the
edge
of
the
bedroom
door
and
withdraw
again
too
rapidly
for
him
to
see
the
face
when
the
nurse
had
gone
away
with
the
candle
this
happened
good
night
master
tim
she
said
usually
shading
the
light
with
one
hand
to
protect
his
eyes
dream
of
me
and
i
dream
of
you
she
went
out
slowly
the
shadow
of
the
door
ran
across
the
ceiling
like
a
train
there
came
a
whispered
colloquy
in
the
corridor
outside
about
himself
of
course
and
he
was
alone
he
heard
her
steps
going
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
bosom
of
the
old
country
house
they
were
audible
for
a
moment
on
the
stone
flooring
of
the
hall
and
sometimes
the
dull
thump
of
the
baize
door
into
the
servants
quarters
just
reached
him
too
then
silence
but
it
was
only
when
the
last
sound
as
well
as
the
last
sign
of
her
had
vanished
that
the
face
emerged
from
its
and
flashed
in
upon
him
round
the
corner
as
a
rule
too
it
came
just
as
he
was
saying
now
i
go
to
sleep
i
wo
think
any
longer
good
night
master
tim
and
happy
dreams
he
loved
to
say
this
to
himself
it
brought
a
sense
of
companionship
as
though
there
were
two
persons
speaking
the
room
was
on
the
top
of
the
old
house
a
big
room
and
his
bed
against
the
wall
had
an
iron
railing
round
it
he
felt
very
safe
and
protected
in
it
the
curtains
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
were
drawn
he
lay
watching
the
firelight
dancing
on
the
heavy
folds
and
their
pattern
showing
a
spaniel
chasing
a
bird
towards
a
bushy
tree
interested
and
amused
him
it
was
repeated
over
and
over
again
he
counted
the
number
of
dogs
and
the
number
of
birds
and
the
number
of
trees
but
could
never
make
them
agree
there
was
a
plan
somewhere
in
that
pattern
if
only
he
could
discover
it
the
dogs
and
birds
and
trees
would
come
out
right
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
times
he
had
played
this
game
for
the
plan
in
the
pattern
made
it
possible
to
take
sides
and
the
bird
and
dog
were
against
him
they
always
won
however
tim
usually
fell
asleep
just
when
the
advantage
was
on
his
own
side
the
curtains
hung
steadily
enough
most
of
the
time
but
it
seemed
to
him
once
or
twice
that
they
stirred
hiding
a
dog
or
bird
on
purpose
to
prevent
his
winning
for
instance
he
had
eleven
birds
and
eleven
trees
and
fixing
them
in
his
mind
by
saying
that
eleven
birds
and
eleven
trees
but
only
ten
dogs
his
eyes
darted
back
to
find
the
eleventh
dog
when
the
curtain
moved
and
threw
all
his
calculations
into
confusion
again
the
eleventh
dog
was
hidden
he
did
not
quite
like
the
movement
it
gave
him
questionable
feelings
rather
for
the
curtain
did
not
move
of
itself
yet
usually
he
was
too
intent
upon
counting
the
dogs
to
feel
positive
alarm
opposite
to
him
was
the
fireplace
full
of
red
and
yellow
coals
and
lying
with
his
head
sideways
on
the
pillow
he
could
see
directly
in
between
the
bars
when
the
coals
settled
with
a
soft
and
powdery
crash
he
turned
his
eyes
from
the
curtains
to
the
grate
trying
to
discover
exactly
which
bits
had
fallen
so
long
as
the
glow
was
there
the
sound
seemed
pleasant
enough
but
sometimes
he
awoke
later
in
the
night
the
room
huge
with
darkness
the
fire
almost
out
and
the
sound
was
not
so
pleasant
then
it
startled
him
the
coals
did
not
fall
of
themselves
it
seemed
that
some
one
poked
them
cautiously
the
shadows
were
very
thick
before
the
bars
as
with
the
curtains
moreover
the
morning
aspect
of
the
extinguished
fire
the
cinders
that
made
a
clinking
sound
like
tin
caused
no
emotion
whatever
in
his
soul
and
it
was
usually
while
he
lay
waiting
for
sleep
tired
both
of
the
curtain
and
the
coal
games
on
the
point
indeed
of
saying
i
go
to
sleep
now
that
the
puzzling
thing
took
place
he
would
be
staring
drowsily
at
the
dying
fire
perhaps
counting
the
stockings
and
flannel
garments
that
hung
along
the
high
when
suddenly
a
person
looked
in
with
lightning
swiftness
through
the
door
and
vanished
again
before
he
could
possibly
turn
his
head
to
see
the
appearance
and
disappearance
were
accomplished
with
amazing
rapidity
always
it
was
a
head
and
shoulders
that
looked
in
and
the
movement
combined
the
speed
the
lightness
and
the
silence
of
a
shadow
only
it
was
not
a
shadow
a
hand
held
the
edge
of
the
door
the
face
shot
round
saw
him
and
withdrew
like
lightning
it
was
utterly
beyond
him
to
imagine
anything
more
quick
and
clever
it
darted
he
heard
no
sound
it
went
but
it
had
seen
him
looked
him
all
over
examined
him
noted
what
he
was
doing
with
that
lightning
glance
it
wanted
to
know
if
he
were
awake
still
or
asleep
and
though
it
went
off
it
still
watched
him
from
a
distance
it
waited
somewhere
it
knew
all
about
him
it
waited
no
one
could
ever
guess
it
came
probably
he
felt
from
beyond
the
house
possibly
from
the
roof
but
most
likely
from
the
garden
or
the
sky
yet
though
strange
it
was
not
terrible
it
was
a
kindly
and
protective
figure
he
felt
and
when
it
happened
he
never
called
for
help
because
the
occurrence
simply
took
his
voice
away
it
comes
from
the
nightmare
passage
he
decided
but
it
a
nightmare
it
puzzled
him
sometimes
moreover
it
came
more
than
once
in
a
single
night
he
was
pretty
sure
not
positive
that
it
occupied
his
room
as
soon
as
he
was
properly
asleep
it
took
possession
sitting
perhaps
before
the
dying
fire
standing
upright
behind
the
heavy
curtains
or
even
lying
down
in
the
empty
bed
his
brother
used
when
he
was
home
from
school
perhaps
it
played
the
curtain
game
perhaps
it
poked
the
coals
it
knew
at
any
rate
where
the
eleventh
dog
had
lain
concealed
it
certainly
came
in
and
out
certainly
too
it
did
not
wish
to
be
seen
for
more
than
once
on
waking
suddenly
in
the
midnight
blackness
tim
knew
it
was
standing
close
beside
his
bed
and
bending
over
him
he
felt
rather
than
heard
its
presence
it
glided
quietly
away
it
moved
with
marvellous
softness
yet
he
was
positive
it
moved
he
felt
the
difference
so
to
speak
it
had
been
near
him
now
it
was
gone
it
came
back
too
just
as
he
was
falling
into
sleep
again
its
midnight
coming
and
going
however
stood
out
sharply
different
from
its
first
shy
tentative
approach
for
in
the
firelight
it
came
alone
whereas
in
the
black
and
silent
hours
it
had
with
it
others
and
it
was
then
he
made
up
his
mind
that
its
swift
and
quiet
movements
were
due
to
the
fact
that
it
had
wings
it
flew
and
the
others
that
came
with
it
in
the
darkness
were
its
little
ones
he
also
made
up
his
mind
that
all
were
friendly
comforting
protective
and
that
while
positively
a
nightmare
it
yet
came
somehow
along
the
nightmare
passage
before
it
reached
him
you
see
it
like
this
he
explained
to
the
nurse
the
big
one
comes
to
visit
me
alone
but
it
only
brings
its
little
ones
when
i
asleep
then
the
quicker
you
get
to
sleep
the
better
is
it
master
tim
he
replied
rather
i
always
do
only
i
wonder
where
they
come
he
spoke
however
as
though
he
had
an
inkling
but
the
nurse
was
so
dull
about
it
that
he
gave
her
up
and
tried
his
father
of
course
replied
this
busy
but
affectionate
parent
either
nobody
at
all
or
else
it
sleep
coming
to
carry
you
away
to
the
land
of
dreams
he
made
the
statement
kindly
but
somewhat
briskly
for
he
was
worried
just
then
about
the
extra
taxes
on
his
land
and
the
effort
to
fix
his
mind
on
tim
fanciful
world
was
beyond
him
at
the
moment
he
lifted
the
boy
on
to
his
knee
kissed
and
patted
him
as
though
he
were
a
favourite
dog
and
planted
him
on
the
rug
again
with
a
flying
sweep
run
and
ask
your
mother
he
added
she
knows
all
that
kind
of
thing
then
come
back
and
tell
me
all
about
it
another
time
tim
found
his
mother
in
an
before
the
fire
of
another
room
she
was
knitting
and
reading
at
the
same
time
a
wonderful
thing
the
boy
could
never
understand
she
raised
her
head
as
he
came
in
pushed
her
glasses
on
to
her
forehead
and
held
her
arms
out
he
told
her
everything
ending
up
with
what
his
father
said
you
see
it
jackman
or
thompson
or
any
one
like
that
he
exclaimed
it
some
one
real
but
nice
she
assured
him
some
one
who
comes
to
take
care
of
you
and
see
that
you
all
safe
and
cosy
oh
yes
i
know
that
but
i
think
your
father
right
she
added
quickly
it
sleep
sure
who
pops
in
round
the
door
like
that
sleep
got
wings
always
heard
then
the
other
thing
the
little
ones
he
asked
are
they
just
sorts
of
dozes
you
think
mother
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
she
turned
down
the
page
of
her
book
closed
it
slowly
put
it
on
the
table
beside
her
more
slowly
still
she
put
her
knitting
away
arranging
the
wool
and
needles
with
some
deliberation
perhaps
she
said
drawing
the
boy
closer
to
her
and
looking
into
his
big
eyes
of
wonder
they
dreams
tim
felt
a
thrill
run
through
him
as
she
said
it
he
stepped
back
a
foot
or
so
and
clapped
his
hands
softly
dreams
he
whispered
with
enthusiasm
and
belief
of
course
i
never
thought
of
that
his
mother
having
proved
her
sagacity
then
made
a
mistake
she
noted
her
success
but
instead
of
leaving
it
there
she
elaborated
and
explained
as
tim
expressed
it
she
went
on
about
it
therefore
he
did
not
listen
he
followed
his
train
of
thought
alone
and
presently
he
interrupted
her
long
sentences
with
a
conclusion
of
his
own
then
i
know
where
she
hides
he
announced
with
a
touch
of
awe
where
she
lives
i
mean
and
without
waiting
to
be
asked
he
imparted
the
information
it
in
the
other
wing
ah
said
his
mother
taken
by
surprise
how
clever
of
you
tim
and
thus
confirmed
it
thenceforward
this
was
established
in
his
life
that
sleep
and
her
attendant
dreams
hid
during
the
daytime
in
that
unused
portion
of
the
great
elizabethan
mansion
called
the
other
wing
this
other
wing
was
unoccupied
its
corridors
untrodden
its
windows
shuttered
and
its
rooms
all
closed
at
various
places
green
baize
doors
led
into
it
but
no
one
ever
opened
them
for
many
years
this
part
had
been
shut
up
and
for
the
children
properly
speaking
it
was
out
of
bounds
they
never
mentioned
it
as
a
possible
place
at
any
rate
in
it
was
not
considered
even
there
was
a
hint
of
the
inaccessible
about
the
other
wing
shadows
dust
and
silence
had
it
to
themselves
but
tim
having
ideas
of
his
own
about
everything
possessed
special
information
about
the
other
wing
he
believed
it
inhabited
who
occupied
the
immense
series
of
empty
rooms
who
trod
the
spacious
corridors
who
passed
to
and
fro
behind
the
shuttered
windows
he
had
not
known
exactly
he
had
called
these
occupants
they
and
the
most
important
among
them
was
the
ruler
the
ruler
of
the
other
wing
was
a
kind
of
deity
powerful
far
away
ever
present
yet
never
seen
and
about
this
ruler
he
had
a
wonderful
conception
for
a
little
boy
he
connected
her
somehow
with
deep
thoughts
of
his
own
the
deepest
of
all
when
he
made
up
adventures
to
the
moon
to
the
stars
or
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
adventures
that
he
lived
inside
himself
as
it
were
to
reach
them
he
must
invariably
pass
through
the
chambers
of
the
other
wing
those
corridors
and
halls
the
nightmare
passage
among
them
lay
along
the
route
they
were
the
first
stage
of
the
journey
once
the
green
baize
doors
swung
to
behind
him
and
the
long
dim
passage
stretched
ahead
he
was
well
on
his
way
into
the
adventure
of
the
moment
the
nightmare
passage
once
passed
he
was
safe
from
capture
but
once
the
shutters
of
a
window
had
been
flung
open
he
was
free
of
the
gigantic
world
that
lay
beyond
for
then
light
poured
in
and
he
could
see
his
way
the
conception
for
a
child
was
curious
it
established
a
correspondence
between
the
mysterious
chambers
of
the
other
wing
and
the
occupied
but
unguessed
chambers
of
his
inner
being
through
these
chambers
through
these
darkened
corridors
along
a
passage
sometimes
dangerous
or
at
least
of
questionable
repute
he
must
pass
to
find
all
adventures
that
were
the
light
when
he
pierced
far
enough
to
take
the
shutters
down
was
discovery
tim
did
not
actually
think
much
less
say
all
this
he
was
aware
of
it
however
he
felt
it
the
other
wing
was
inside
himself
as
well
as
through
the
green
baize
doors
his
inner
map
of
wonder
included
both
of
them
but
now
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
knew
who
lived
there
and
who
the
ruler
was
a
shutter
had
fallen
of
its
own
accord
light
poured
in
he
made
a
guess
and
mother
had
confirmed
it
sleep
and
her
little
ones
the
host
of
dreams
were
the
daylight
occupants
they
stole
out
when
the
darkness
fell
all
adventures
in
life
began
and
ended
by
a
dream
discoverable
by
first
passing
through
the
other
wing
and
having
settled
this
his
one
desire
now
was
to
travel
over
the
map
upon
journeys
of
exploration
and
discovery
the
map
inside
himself
he
knew
already
but
the
map
of
the
other
wing
he
had
not
seen
his
mind
knew
it
he
had
a
clear
mental
picture
of
rooms
and
halls
and
passages
but
his
feet
had
never
trod
the
silent
floors
where
dust
and
shadows
hid
the
flock
of
dreams
by
day
the
mighty
chambers
where
sleep
ruled
he
longed
to
stand
in
to
see
the
ruler
face
to
face
he
made
up
his
mind
to
get
into
the
other
wing
to
accomplish
this
was
difficult
but
tim
was
a
determined
youngster
and
he
meant
to
try
he
meant
also
to
succeed
he
deliberated
at
night
he
could
not
possibly
manage
it
in
any
case
the
ruler
and
her
host
all
left
it
after
dark
to
fly
about
the
world
the
wing
would
be
empty
and
the
emptiness
would
frighten
him
therefore
he
must
make
a
daylight
visit
and
it
was
a
daylight
visit
he
decided
on
he
deliberated
more
there
were
rules
and
risks
involved
it
meant
going
out
of
bounds
the
danger
of
being
seen
the
certainty
of
being
questioned
by
some
idle
and
inquisitive
where
in
the
world
have
you
been
all
this
time
and
so
forth
these
things
he
thought
out
carefully
and
though
he
arrived
at
no
solution
he
felt
satisfied
that
it
would
be
all
right
that
is
he
recognised
the
risks
to
be
prepared
was
half
the
battle
for
nothing
then
could
take
him
by
surprise
the
notion
that
he
might
slip
in
from
the
garden
was
soon
abandoned
the
red
bricks
showed
no
openings
there
was
no
door
from
the
courtyard
also
entrance
was
impracticable
even
on
tiptoe
he
could
barely
reach
the
broad
of
stone
when
playing
alone
or
walking
with
the
french
governess
he
examined
every
outside
possibility
none
offered
the
shutters
supposing
he
could
reach
them
were
thick
and
solid
meanwhile
when
opportunity
offered
he
stood
against
the
outside
walls
and
listened
his
ear
pressed
against
the
tight
red
bricks
the
towers
and
gables
of
the
wing
rose
overhead
he
heard
the
wind
go
whispering
along
the
eaves
he
imagined
tiptoe
movements
and
a
sound
of
wings
inside
sleep
and
her
little
ones
were
busily
preparing
for
their
journeys
after
dark
they
hid
but
they
did
not
sleep
in
this
unused
wing
vaster
alone
than
any
other
country
house
he
had
ever
seen
sleep
taught
and
trained
her
flock
of
feathered
dreams
it
was
very
wonderful
they
probably
supplied
the
entire
county
but
more
wonderful
still
was
the
thought
that
the
ruler
herself
should
take
the
trouble
to
come
to
his
particular
room
and
personally
watch
over
him
all
night
long
that
was
amazing
and
it
flashed
across
his
imaginative
inquiring
mind
perhaps
they
take
me
with
them
the
moment
i
asleep
that
why
she
comes
to
see
me
yet
his
chief
preoccupation
was
how
sleep
got
out
through
the
green
baize
doors
of
course
by
a
process
of
elimination
he
arrived
at
a
conclusion
he
too
must
enter
through
a
green
baize
door
and
risk
detection
of
late
the
lightning
visits
had
ceased
the
silent
darting
figure
had
not
peeped
in
and
vanished
as
it
used
to
do
he
fell
asleep
too
quickly
now
almost
before
jackman
reached
the
hall
and
long
before
the
fire
began
to
die
also
the
dogs
and
birds
upon
the
curtains
always
matched
the
trees
exactly
and
he
won
the
curtain
game
quite
easily
there
was
never
a
dog
or
bird
too
many
the
curtain
never
stirred
it
had
been
thus
ever
since
his
talk
with
mother
and
father
and
so
he
came
to
make
a
second
discovery
his
parents
did
not
really
believe
in
his
figure
she
kept
away
on
that
account
they
doubted
her
she
hid
here
was
still
another
incentive
to
go
and
find
her
out
he
ached
for
her
she
was
so
kind
she
gave
herself
so
much
trouble
just
for
his
little
self
in
the
big
and
lonely
bedroom
yet
his
parents
spoke
of
her
as
though
she
were
of
no
account
he
longed
to
see
her
face
to
face
and
tell
her
that
believed
in
her
and
loved
her
for
he
was
positive
she
would
like
to
hear
it
she
cared
though
he
had
fallen
asleep
of
late
too
quickly
for
him
to
see
her
flash
in
at
the
door
he
had
known
nicer
dreams
than
ever
in
his
life
before
travelling
dreams
and
it
was
she
who
sent
them
more
he
was
sure
she
took
him
out
with
her
one
evening
in
the
dusk
of
a
march
day
his
opportunity
came
and
only
just
in
time
for
his
brother
jack
was
expected
home
from
school
on
the
morrow
and
with
jack
in
the
other
bed
no
figure
would
ever
care
to
show
itself
also
it
was
easter
and
after
easter
though
tim
was
not
aware
of
it
at
the
time
he
was
to
say
finally
to
governesses
and
become
a
at
a
preparatory
school
for
wellington
the
opportunity
offered
itself
so
naturally
moreover
that
tim
took
it
without
hesitation
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
question
much
less
to
refuse
it
the
thing
was
obviously
meant
to
be
for
he
found
himself
unexpectedly
in
front
of
a
green
baize
door
and
the
green
baize
door
was
swinging
somebody
therefore
had
just
passed
through
it
it
had
come
about
in
this
wise
father
away
in
scotland
at
inglemuir
the
shooting
place
was
expected
back
next
morning
mother
had
driven
over
to
the
church
upon
some
easter
business
or
other
and
the
governess
had
been
allowed
her
holiday
at
home
in
france
tim
therefore
had
the
run
of
the
house
and
in
the
hour
between
tea
and
he
made
good
use
of
it
fully
able
to
defy
such
obstacles
as
nurses
and
butlers
he
explored
all
manner
of
forbidden
places
with
ardent
thoroughness
arriving
finally
in
the
sacred
precincts
of
his
father
study
this
wonderful
room
was
the
very
heart
and
centre
of
the
whole
big
house
he
had
been
birched
here
long
ago
here
too
his
father
had
told
him
with
a
grave
yet
smiling
face
you
got
a
new
companion
tim
a
little
sister
you
must
be
very
kind
to
her
also
it
was
the
place
where
all
the
money
was
kept
what
he
called
father
jolly
smell
was
strong
in
it
papers
tobacco
books
flavoured
by
hunting
crops
and
gunpowder
at
first
he
felt
awed
standing
motionless
just
inside
the
door
but
presently
recovering
equilibrium
he
moved
cautiously
on
tiptoe
towards
the
gigantic
desk
where
important
papers
were
piled
in
untidy
patches
these
he
did
not
touch
but
beside
them
his
quick
eye
noted
the
jagged
piece
of
iron
shell
his
father
brought
home
from
his
crimean
campaign
and
now
used
as
a
it
was
difficult
to
lift
however
he
climbed
into
the
comfortable
chair
and
swung
round
and
round
it
was
a
and
he
sank
down
among
the
cushions
in
it
staring
at
the
strange
things
on
the
great
desk
before
him
as
if
fascinated
next
he
turned
away
and
saw
the
in
the
corner
this
he
knew
he
was
allowed
to
touch
he
had
played
with
these
sticks
before
there
were
twenty
perhaps
all
told
with
curious
carved
handles
brought
from
every
corner
of
the
world
many
of
them
cut
by
his
father
own
hand
in
queer
and
distant
places
and
among
them
tim
fixed
his
eye
upon
a
cane
with
an
ivory
handle
a
slender
polished
cane
that
he
had
always
coveted
tremendously
it
was
the
kind
he
meant
to
use
when
he
was
a
man
it
bent
it
quivered
and
when
he
swished
it
through
the
air
it
trembled
like
a
and
made
a
whistling
noise
yet
it
was
very
strong
in
spite
of
its
elastic
qualities
a
family
treasure
it
was
also
an
relic
it
had
been
his
grandfather
walking
stick
something
of
another
century
clung
visibly
about
it
still
it
had
dignity
and
grace
and
leisure
in
its
very
aspect
and
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
how
grandpapa
must
miss
it
would
he
just
love
to
have
it
back
again
how
it
happened
exactly
tim
did
not
know
but
a
few
minutes
later
he
found
himself
walking
about
the
deserted
halls
and
passages
of
the
house
with
the
air
of
an
elderly
gentleman
of
a
hundred
years
ago
proud
as
a
courtier
flourishing
the
stick
like
an
eighteenth
century
dandy
in
the
mall
that
the
cane
reached
to
his
shoulder
made
no
difference
he
held
it
accordingly
swaggering
on
his
way
he
was
off
upon
an
adventure
he
dived
down
through
the
byways
of
the
other
wing
inside
himself
as
though
the
stick
transported
him
to
the
days
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
used
it
in
another
century
it
may
seem
strange
to
those
who
dwell
in
smaller
houses
but
in
this
rambling
elizabethan
mansion
there
were
whole
sections
that
even
to
tim
were
strange
and
unfamiliar
in
his
mind
the
map
of
the
other
wing
was
clearer
by
far
than
the
geography
of
the
part
he
travelled
daily
he
came
to
passages
and
halls
long
corridors
of
stone
beyond
the
picture
gallery
narrow
wainscoted
with
four
steps
down
and
a
little
later
two
steps
up
deserted
chambers
with
arches
guarding
them
all
hung
with
the
soft
march
twilight
and
all
bewilderingly
unrecognised
with
a
sense
of
adventure
born
of
naughtiness
he
went
carelessly
along
farther
and
farther
into
the
heart
of
this
unfamiliar
country
swinging
the
cane
one
thumb
stuck
into
the
of
his
blue
serge
suit
whistling
softly
to
himself
excited
yet
keenly
on
the
alert
and
suddenly
found
himself
opposite
a
door
that
checked
all
further
advance
it
was
a
green
baize
door
and
it
was
swinging
he
stopped
abruptly
facing
it
he
stared
he
gripped
his
cane
more
tightly
he
held
his
breath
the
other
wing
he
gasped
in
a
swallowed
whisper
it
was
an
entrance
but
an
entrance
he
had
never
seen
before
he
thought
he
knew
every
door
by
heart
but
this
one
was
new
he
stood
motionless
for
several
minutes
watching
it
the
door
had
two
halves
but
one
half
only
was
swinging
each
swing
shorter
than
the
one
before
he
heard
the
little
puffs
of
air
it
made
it
settled
finally
the
last
movements
very
short
and
rapid
it
stopped
and
the
boy
heart
after
similar
rapid
strokes
stopped
also
for
a
moment
some
one
just
gone
through
he
gulped
and
even
as
he
said
it
he
knew
who
the
some
one
was
the
conviction
just
dropped
into
him
grandfather
he
knows
i
got
his
stick
he
wants
it
on
the
heels
of
this
flashed
instantly
another
amazing
certainty
he
sleeps
in
there
he
having
dreams
that
what
being
dead
means
his
first
impulse
then
took
the
form
of
i
must
let
father
know
it
make
him
burst
for
joy
but
his
second
was
for
himself
to
finish
his
adventure
and
it
was
this
naturally
enough
that
gained
the
day
he
could
tell
his
father
later
his
first
duty
was
plainly
to
go
through
the
door
into
the
other
wing
he
must
give
the
stick
back
to
its
owner
he
must
it
back
the
test
of
will
and
character
came
now
tim
had
imagination
and
so
knew
the
meaning
of
fear
but
there
was
nothing
craven
in
him
he
could
howl
and
scream
and
stamp
like
any
other
person
of
his
age
when
the
occasion
called
for
such
behaviour
but
such
occasions
were
due
to
temper
roused
by
a
thwarted
will
and
the
histrionics
were
half
pretended
to
produce
a
calculated
effect
there
was
no
one
to
thwart
his
will
at
present
he
also
knew
how
to
be
afraid
of
nothing
to
be
afraid
without
ostensible
cause
that
is
which
was
merely
nerves
he
could
have
the
shudders
with
the
best
of
them
but
when
a
real
thing
faced
him
tim
character
emerged
to
meet
it
he
would
clench
his
hands
brace
his
muscles
set
his
teeth
and
wish
to
heaven
he
was
bigger
but
he
would
not
flinch
being
imaginative
he
lived
the
worst
a
dozen
times
before
it
happened
yet
in
the
final
crash
he
stood
up
like
a
man
he
had
that
highest
pluck
the
courage
of
a
sensitive
temperament
and
at
this
particular
juncture
somewhat
ticklish
for
a
boy
of
eight
or
nine
it
did
not
fail
him
he
lifted
the
cane
and
pushed
the
swinging
door
wide
open
then
he
walked
through
it
into
the
other
wing
the
green
baize
door
swung
to
behind
him
he
was
even
sufficiently
master
of
himself
to
turn
and
close
it
with
a
steady
hand
because
he
did
not
care
to
hear
the
series
of
muffled
thuds
its
lessening
swings
would
cause
but
he
realised
clearly
his
position
knew
he
was
doing
a
tremendous
thing
holding
the
cane
between
fingers
very
tightly
clenched
he
advanced
bravely
along
the
corridor
that
stretched
before
him
and
all
fear
left
him
from
that
moment
replaced
it
seemed
by
a
mild
and
exquisite
surprise
his
footsteps
made
no
sound
he
walked
on
air
instead
of
darkness
or
the
twilight
he
expected
a
diffused
and
gentle
light
that
seemed
like
the
silver
on
the
lawn
when
a
sails
a
cloudless
sky
lay
everywhere
he
knew
his
way
moreover
knew
exactly
where
he
was
and
whither
he
was
going
the
corridor
was
as
familiar
to
him
as
the
floor
of
his
own
bedroom
he
recognised
the
shape
and
length
of
it
it
agreed
exactly
with
the
map
he
had
constructed
long
ago
though
he
had
never
to
the
best
of
his
knowledge
entered
it
before
he
knew
with
intimacy
its
every
detail
and
thus
the
surprise
he
felt
was
mild
and
far
from
disconcerting
i
here
again
was
the
kind
of
thought
he
had
it
was
he
got
here
that
caused
the
faint
surprise
apparently
he
no
longer
swaggered
however
but
walked
carefully
and
half
on
tiptoe
holding
the
ivory
handle
of
the
cane
with
a
kind
of
affectionate
respect
and
as
he
advanced
the
light
closed
softly
up
behind
him
obliterating
the
way
by
which
he
had
come
but
this
he
did
not
know
because
he
did
not
look
behind
him
he
only
looked
in
front
where
the
corridor
stretched
its
silvery
length
towards
the
great
chamber
where
he
knew
the
cane
must
be
surrendered
the
person
who
had
preceded
him
down
this
ancient
corridor
passing
through
the
green
baize
door
just
before
he
reached
it
this
person
his
father
father
now
stood
in
that
great
chamber
waiting
to
receive
his
own
tim
knew
it
as
surely
as
he
knew
he
breathed
at
the
far
end
he
even
made
out
the
larger
patch
of
silvery
light
which
marked
its
gaping
doorway
there
was
another
thing
he
knew
as
well
that
this
corridor
he
moved
along
between
rooms
with
doors
was
the
nightmare
corridor
often
and
often
he
had
traversed
it
each
room
was
occupied
this
is
the
nightmare
passage
he
whispered
to
himself
but
i
know
the
ruler
it
does
matter
none
of
them
can
get
out
or
do
anything
he
heard
them
none
the
less
inside
as
he
passed
by
he
heard
them
scratching
to
get
out
the
feeling
of
security
made
him
reckless
he
took
unnecessary
risks
he
brushed
the
panels
as
he
passed
and
the
love
of
keen
sensation
for
its
own
sake
the
desire
to
feel
an
awful
thrill
tempted
him
once
so
sharply
that
he
raised
his
stick
and
poked
a
door
with
it
he
was
not
prepared
for
the
result
but
he
gained
the
sensation
and
the
thrill
for
the
door
opened
with
instant
swiftness
half
an
inch
a
hand
emerged
caught
the
stick
and
tried
to
draw
it
in
tim
sprang
back
as
if
he
had
been
struck
he
pulled
at
the
ivory
handle
with
all
his
strength
but
his
strength
was
less
than
nothing
he
tried
to
shout
but
his
voice
had
gone
a
terror
of
the
moon
came
over
him
for
he
was
unable
to
loosen
his
hold
of
the
handle
his
fingers
had
become
a
part
of
it
an
appalling
weakness
turned
him
helpless
he
was
dragged
inch
by
inch
towards
the
fearful
door
the
end
of
the
stick
was
already
through
the
narrow
crack
he
could
not
see
the
hand
that
pulled
but
he
knew
it
was
terrific
he
understood
now
why
the
world
was
strange
why
horses
galloped
furiously
and
why
trains
whistled
as
they
raced
through
stations
all
the
comedy
and
terror
of
nightmare
gripped
his
heart
with
pincers
made
of
ice
the
disproportion
was
abominable
the
final
collapse
rushed
over
him
when
without
a
sign
of
warning
the
door
slammed
silently
and
between
the
jamb
and
the
wall
the
cane
was
crushed
as
flat
as
if
it
were
a
bulrush
so
irresistible
was
the
force
behind
the
door
that
the
solid
stick
just
went
flat
as
a
stalk
of
a
bulrush
he
looked
at
it
it
a
bulrush
he
did
not
laugh
the
absurdity
was
so
distressingly
unnatural
the
horror
of
finding
a
bulrush
where
he
had
expected
a
polished
cane
this
hideous
and
appalling
detail
held
the
nameless
horror
of
the
nightmare
it
betrayed
him
utterly
why
had
he
not
always
known
really
that
the
stick
was
not
a
stick
but
a
thin
and
hollow
reed
then
the
cane
was
safely
in
his
hand
unbroken
he
stood
looking
at
it
the
nightmare
was
in
full
swing
he
heard
another
door
opening
behind
his
back
a
door
he
had
not
touched
there
was
just
time
to
see
a
hand
thrusting
and
waving
dreadfully
familiarly
at
him
through
the
narrow
crack
just
time
to
realise
that
this
was
another
nightmare
acting
in
atrocious
concert
with
the
first
when
he
saw
closely
beside
him
towering
to
the
ceiling
the
protective
kindly
figure
that
visited
his
bedroom
in
the
turning
movement
he
made
to
meet
the
attack
he
became
aware
of
her
and
his
terror
passed
it
was
a
nightmare
terror
merely
the
infinite
horror
vanished
only
the
comedy
remained
he
smiled
he
saw
her
dimly
only
she
was
so
vast
but
he
saw
her
the
ruler
of
the
other
wing
at
last
and
knew
that
he
was
safe
again
he
gazed
with
a
tremendous
love
and
wonder
trying
to
see
her
clearly
but
the
face
was
hidden
far
aloft
and
seemed
to
melt
into
the
sky
beyond
the
roof
he
discerned
that
she
was
larger
than
the
night
only
far
far
softer
with
wings
that
folded
above
him
more
tenderly
even
than
his
arms
that
there
were
points
of
light
like
stars
among
the
feathers
and
that
she
was
vast
enough
to
cover
millions
and
millions
of
people
all
at
once
moreover
she
did
not
fade
or
go
so
far
as
he
could
see
but
spread
herself
in
such
a
way
that
he
lost
sight
of
her
she
spread
over
the
entire
wing
and
tim
remembered
that
this
was
all
quite
natural
really
he
had
often
and
often
been
down
this
corridor
before
the
nightmare
corridor
was
no
new
experience
it
had
to
be
faced
as
usual
once
knowing
what
hid
inside
the
rooms
he
was
bound
to
tempt
them
out
they
drew
enticed
attracted
him
this
was
their
power
it
was
their
special
strength
that
they
could
suck
him
helplessly
towards
them
and
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
he
understood
exactly
why
he
was
tempted
to
tap
with
the
cane
upon
their
awful
doors
but
having
done
so
he
had
accepted
the
challenge
and
could
now
continue
his
journey
quietly
and
safely
the
ruler
of
the
other
wing
had
taken
him
in
charge
a
delicious
sense
of
carelessness
came
on
him
there
was
softness
as
of
water
in
the
solid
things
about
him
nothing
that
could
hurt
or
bruise
holding
the
cane
firmly
by
its
ivory
handle
he
went
forward
along
the
corridor
walking
as
on
air
the
end
was
quickly
reached
he
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
mighty
chamber
where
he
knew
the
owner
of
the
cane
was
waiting
the
long
corridor
lay
behind
him
in
front
he
saw
the
spacious
dimensions
of
a
lofty
hall
that
gave
him
the
feeling
of
being
in
the
crystal
palace
euston
station
or
paul
high
narrow
windows
cut
deeply
into
the
wall
stood
in
a
row
upon
the
other
side
an
enormous
open
fireplace
of
burning
logs
was
on
his
right
thick
tapestries
hung
from
the
ceiling
to
the
floor
of
stone
and
in
the
centre
of
the
chamber
was
a
massive
table
of
dark
shining
wood
great
chairs
with
carved
stiff
backs
set
here
and
there
beside
it
and
in
the
biggest
of
these
chairs
there
sat
a
figure
looking
at
him
gravely
the
figure
of
an
old
old
man
yet
there
was
no
surprise
in
the
boy
heart
there
was
a
thrill
of
pleasure
and
excitement
only
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
he
had
known
quite
well
the
figure
would
be
there
known
also
it
would
look
like
this
exactly
he
stepped
forward
on
to
the
floor
of
stone
without
a
trace
of
fear
or
trembling
holding
the
precious
cane
in
two
hands
now
before
him
as
though
to
present
it
to
its
owner
he
felt
proud
and
pleased
he
had
run
risks
for
this
and
the
figure
rose
quietly
to
meet
him
advancing
in
a
stately
manner
over
the
hard
stone
floor
the
eyes
looked
gravely
sweetly
down
at
him
the
aquiline
nose
stood
out
tim
knew
him
perfectly
the
of
shining
satin
the
gleaming
buckles
on
the
shoes
the
neat
dark
stockings
the
lace
and
ruffles
about
neck
and
wrists
the
coloured
waistcoat
opening
so
widely
all
the
details
of
the
picture
over
father
mantelpiece
where
it
hung
between
two
crimean
bayonets
were
reproduced
in
life
before
his
eyes
at
last
only
the
polished
cane
with
the
ivory
handle
was
not
there
tim
went
three
steps
nearer
to
the
advancing
figure
and
held
out
both
his
hands
with
the
cane
laid
crosswise
on
them
i
brought
it
grandfather
he
said
in
a
faint
but
clear
and
steady
tone
here
it
is
and
the
other
stooped
a
little
put
out
three
fingers
half
concealed
by
falling
lace
and
took
it
by
the
ivory
handle
he
made
a
courtly
bow
to
tim
he
smiled
but
though
there
was
pleasure
it
was
a
grave
sad
smile
he
spoke
then
the
voice
was
slow
and
very
deep
there
was
a
delicate
softness
in
it
the
suave
politeness
of
an
older
day
thank
you
he
said
i
value
it
it
was
given
to
me
by
my
grandfather
i
forgot
it
when
i
his
voice
grew
indistinct
a
little
yes
said
tim
when
i
left
the
old
gentleman
repeated
oh
said
tim
thinking
how
beautiful
and
kind
the
gracious
figure
was
the
old
man
ran
his
slender
fingers
carefully
along
the
cane
feeling
the
polished
surface
with
satisfaction
he
lingered
specially
over
the
smoothness
of
the
ivory
handle
he
was
evidently
very
pleased
i
was
not
quite
myself
er
at
the
moment
he
went
on
gently
my
memory
failed
me
somewhat
he
sighed
as
though
an
immense
relief
was
in
him
forget
things
too
sometimes
tim
mentioned
sympathetically
he
simply
loved
his
grandfather
he
hoped
for
a
moment
he
would
be
lifted
up
and
kissed
i
glad
i
brought
it
he
faltered
that
you
got
it
again
the
other
turned
his
kind
grey
eyes
upon
him
the
smile
on
his
face
was
full
of
gratitude
as
he
looked
down
thank
you
my
boy
i
am
truly
and
deeply
indebted
to
you
you
courted
danger
for
my
sake
others
have
tried
before
but
the
nightmare
passage
er
he
broke
off
he
tapped
the
stick
firmly
on
the
stone
flooring
as
though
to
test
it
bending
a
trifle
he
put
his
weight
upon
it
ah
he
exclaimed
with
a
short
sigh
of
relief
i
can
now
his
voice
again
grew
indistinct
tim
did
not
catch
the
words
yes
he
asked
again
aware
for
the
first
time
that
a
touch
of
awe
was
in
his
get
about
again
the
other
continued
very
low
without
my
cane
he
added
the
voice
failing
with
each
word
the
old
lips
uttered
i
could
not
possibly
allow
myself
to
be
seen
it
was
indeed
deplorable
unpardonable
of
me
to
forget
in
such
a
way
zounds
sir
i
i
his
voice
sank
away
suddenly
into
a
sound
of
wind
he
straightened
up
tapping
the
iron
ferrule
of
his
cane
on
the
stones
in
a
series
of
loud
knocks
tim
felt
a
strange
sensation
creep
into
his
legs
the
queer
words
frightened
him
a
little
the
old
man
took
a
step
towards
him
he
still
smiled
but
there
was
a
new
meaning
in
the
smile
a
sudden
earnestness
had
replaced
the
courtly
leisurely
manner
the
next
words
seemed
to
blow
down
upon
the
boy
from
above
as
though
a
cold
wind
brought
them
from
the
sky
outside
yet
the
words
he
knew
were
kindly
meant
and
very
sensible
it
was
only
the
abrupt
change
that
startled
him
grandfather
after
all
was
but
a
man
the
distant
sound
recalled
something
in
him
to
that
outside
world
from
which
the
cold
wind
blew
my
eternal
thanks
to
you
he
heard
while
the
voice
and
face
and
figure
seemed
to
withdraw
deeper
and
deeper
into
the
heart
of
the
mighty
chamber
i
shall
not
forget
your
kindness
and
your
courage
it
is
a
debt
i
can
fortunately
one
day
repay
but
now
you
had
best
return
and
with
dispatch
for
your
head
and
arm
lie
heavily
on
the
table
the
documents
are
scattered
there
is
a
cushion
fallen
and
my
son
is
in
the
house
farewell
you
had
best
leave
me
quickly
see
stands
behind
you
waiting
go
with
her
go
now
the
entire
scene
had
vanished
even
before
the
final
words
were
uttered
tim
felt
empty
space
about
him
a
vast
shadowy
figure
bore
him
through
it
as
with
mighty
wings
he
flew
he
rushed
he
remembered
nothing
more
until
he
heard
another
voice
and
felt
a
heavy
hand
upon
his
shoulder
tim
you
rascal
what
are
you
doing
in
my
study
and
in
the
dark
like
this
he
looked
up
into
his
father
face
without
a
word
he
felt
dazed
the
next
minute
his
father
had
caught
him
up
and
kissed
him
ragamuffin
how
did
you
guess
i
was
coming
back
he
shook
him
playfully
and
kissed
his
tumbling
hair
and
you
been
asleep
too
into
the
bargain
well
how
everything
at
home
eh
coming
back
from
school
you
know
and
jack
came
home
indeed
the
following
day
and
when
the
easter
holidays
were
over
the
governess
stayed
abroad
and
tim
went
off
to
adventures
of
another
kind
in
the
preparatory
school
for
wellington
life
slipped
rapidly
along
with
him
he
grew
into
a
man
his
mother
and
his
father
died
jack
followed
them
within
a
little
space
tim
inherited
married
settled
down
into
his
great
possessions
and
opened
up
the
other
wing
the
dreams
of
imaginative
boyhood
all
had
faded
perhaps
he
had
merely
put
them
away
or
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
them
at
any
rate
he
never
spoke
of
such
things
now
and
when
his
irish
wife
mentioned
her
belief
that
the
old
country
house
possessed
a
family
ghost
even
declaring
that
she
had
met
an
eighteenth
century
figure
of
a
man
in
the
corridors
an
old
old
man
who
bends
down
upon
a
stick
tim
only
laughed
and
said
that
as
it
ought
to
be
and
if
these
awful
force
us
to
sell
some
day
a
respectable
ghost
will
increase
the
market
value
but
one
night
he
woke
and
heard
a
tapping
on
the
floor
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
listened
there
was
a
chilly
feeling
down
his
back
belief
had
long
since
gone
out
of
him
he
felt
uncannily
afraid
the
sound
came
nearer
and
nearer
there
were
light
footsteps
with
it
the
door
opened
it
opened
a
little
wider
that
is
for
it
already
stood
ajar
and
there
upon
the
threshold
stood
a
figure
that
it
seemed
he
knew
he
saw
the
face
as
with
all
the
vivid
sharpness
of
reality
there
was
a
smile
upon
it
but
a
smile
of
warning
and
alarm
the
arm
was
raised
tim
saw
the
slender
hand
lace
falling
down
upon
the
long
thin
fingers
and
in
them
tightly
gripped
a
polished
cane
shaking
the
cane
twice
to
and
fro
in
the
air
the
face
thrust
forward
spoke
certain
words
and
vanished
but
the
words
were
inaudible
for
though
the
lips
distinctly
moved
no
sound
apparently
came
from
them
and
tim
sprang
out
of
bed
the
room
was
full
of
darkness
he
turned
the
light
on
the
door
he
saw
was
shut
as
usual
he
had
of
course
been
dreaming
but
he
noticed
a
curious
odour
in
the
air
he
sniffed
it
once
or
twice
then
grasped
the
truth
it
was
a
smell
of
burning
fortunately
he
awoke
just
in
time
he
was
acclaimed
a
hero
for
his
promptitude
after
many
days
when
the
damage
was
repaired
and
nerves
had
settled
down
once
more
into
the
calm
routine
of
country
life
he
told
the
story
to
his
wife
the
entire
story
he
told
the
adventure
of
his
imaginative
boyhood
with
it
she
asked
to
see
the
old
family
cane
and
it
was
this
request
of
hers
that
brought
back
to
memory
a
detail
tim
had
entirely
forgotten
all
these
years
he
remembered
it
suddenly
again
the
loss
of
the
cane
the
hubbub
his
father
kicked
up
about
it
the
endless
futile
search
for
the
stick
had
never
been
found
and
tim
who
was
questioned
very
closely
concerning
it
swore
with
all
his
might
that
he
had
not
the
smallest
notion
where
it
was
which
was
of
course
the
truth
vii
the
occupant
of
the
room
he
arrived
late
at
night
by
the
yellow
diligence
stiff
and
cramped
after
the
toilsome
ascent
of
three
slow
hours
the
village
a
single
mass
of
shadow
was
already
asleep
only
in
front
of
the
little
hotel
was
there
noise
and
light
and
bustle
for
a
moment
the
horses
with
tired
slouching
gait
crossed
the
road
and
disappeared
into
the
stable
of
their
own
accord
their
harness
trailing
in
the
dust
and
the
lumbering
diligence
stood
for
the
night
where
they
had
dragged
it
the
body
of
a
great
beetle
with
broken
legs
in
spite
of
his
physical
weariness
the
schoolmaster
revelling
in
the
first
hours
of
his
holiday
felt
exhilarated
for
the
high
alpine
valley
was
marvellously
still
stars
twinkled
over
the
torn
ridges
of
the
dent
du
midi
where
spectral
snows
gleamed
against
rocks
that
looked
like
solid
ink
and
the
keen
air
smelt
of
pine
forests
pastures
and
freshly
sawn
wood
he
took
it
all
in
with
a
kind
of
bewildered
delight
for
a
few
minutes
while
the
other
three
passengers
gave
directions
about
their
luggage
and
went
to
their
rooms
then
he
turned
and
walked
over
the
coarse
matting
into
the
glare
of
the
hall
only
just
able
to
resist
stopping
to
examine
the
big
mountain
map
that
hung
upon
the
wall
by
the
door
and
with
a
sudden
disagreeable
shock
he
came
down
from
the
ideal
to
the
actual
for
at
the
inn
the
only
inn
there
was
no
vacant
room
even
the
available
sofas
were
occupied
how
stupid
he
had
been
not
to
write
yet
it
had
been
impossible
he
remembered
for
he
had
come
to
the
decision
suddenly
that
morning
in
geneva
enticed
by
the
brilliance
of
the
weather
after
a
week
of
rain
they
talked
endlessly
this
porter
and
the
old
woman
her
face
was
hard
he
noticed
gesticulating
all
the
time
and
pointing
all
about
the
village
with
suggestions
that
he
ill
understood
for
his
french
was
limited
and
their
was
fearful
he
might
find
a
room
or
but
we
are
full
more
full
than
we
care
about
perhaps
if
give
up
their
rooms
and
then
with
much
shrugging
of
shoulders
the
old
woman
stared
at
the
porter
and
the
porter
stared
sleepily
at
the
schoolmaster
at
length
however
by
some
process
of
hope
he
did
not
himself
understand
and
following
directions
given
by
the
old
woman
that
were
utterly
unintelligible
he
went
out
into
the
street
and
walked
towards
a
dark
group
of
houses
she
had
pointed
out
to
him
he
only
knew
that
he
meant
to
thunder
at
a
door
and
ask
for
a
room
he
was
too
weary
to
think
out
details
the
porter
half
made
to
go
with
him
but
turned
back
at
the
last
moment
to
speak
with
the
old
woman
the
houses
sketched
themselves
dimly
in
the
general
blackness
the
air
was
cold
the
whole
valley
was
filled
with
the
rush
and
thunder
of
falling
water
he
was
thinking
vaguely
that
the
dawn
could
not
be
very
far
away
and
that
he
might
even
spend
the
night
wandering
in
the
woods
when
there
was
a
sharp
noise
behind
him
and
he
turned
to
see
a
figure
hurrying
after
him
it
was
the
porter
running
and
in
the
little
hall
of
the
inn
there
began
again
a
confused
conversation
with
frequent
muttered
colloquy
and
whispered
asides
in
between
the
woman
and
the
porter
the
net
result
of
which
was
that
if
monsieur
did
not
object
there
a
room
after
all
on
the
first
floor
only
it
was
in
a
sense
that
is
to
say
but
the
schoolmaster
took
the
room
without
inquiring
too
closely
into
the
puzzle
that
had
somehow
provided
it
so
suddenly
the
ethics
of
had
nothing
to
do
with
him
if
the
woman
offered
him
quarters
it
was
not
for
him
to
argue
with
her
whether
the
said
quarters
were
legitimately
hers
to
offer
but
the
porter
evidently
a
little
thrilled
accompanied
the
guest
up
to
the
room
and
supplied
in
a
mixture
of
french
and
english
details
omitted
by
the
landlady
and
minturn
the
schoolmaster
soon
shared
the
thrill
with
him
and
found
himself
in
the
atmosphere
of
a
possible
tragedy
all
who
know
the
peculiar
excitement
that
belongs
to
high
mountain
valleys
where
dangerous
climbing
is
a
chief
feature
of
the
attractions
will
understand
a
certain
faint
element
of
high
alarm
that
goes
with
the
picture
one
looks
up
at
the
desolate
soaring
ridges
and
thinks
involuntarily
of
the
men
who
find
their
pleasure
for
days
and
nights
together
scaling
perilous
summits
among
the
clouds
and
conquering
inch
by
inch
the
icy
peaks
that
for
ever
shake
their
dark
terror
in
the
sky
the
atmosphere
of
adventure
spiced
with
the
possible
horror
of
a
very
grim
order
of
tragedy
is
inseparable
from
any
imaginative
contemplation
of
the
scene
and
the
idea
minturn
gleaned
from
the
porter
lost
nothing
by
his
ignorance
of
the
language
this
englishwoman
the
real
occupant
of
the
room
had
insisted
on
going
without
a
guide
she
had
left
just
before
daybreak
two
days
before
the
porter
had
seen
her
start
and
she
had
not
returned
the
route
was
difficult
and
dangerous
yet
not
impossible
for
a
skilled
climber
even
a
solitary
one
and
the
englishwoman
was
an
experienced
mountaineer
also
she
was
careless
of
advice
bored
by
warnings
to
a
degree
queer
moreover
for
she
kept
entirely
to
herself
and
sometimes
remained
in
her
room
with
locked
doors
admitting
no
one
for
days
together
a
crank
evidently
of
the
first
water
this
much
minturn
gathered
clearly
enough
from
the
porter
talk
while
his
luggage
was
brought
in
and
the
room
set
to
rights
further
too
that
the
search
party
had
gone
out
and
of
course
return
at
any
moment
in
which
case
thus
the
room
was
empty
yet
still
hers
if
monsieur
did
not
object
if
the
risk
he
ran
of
having
to
turn
out
suddenly
in
the
night
it
was
the
loquacious
porter
who
furnished
the
details
that
made
the
transaction
questionable
and
minturn
dismissed
the
loquacious
porter
as
soon
as
possible
and
prepared
to
get
into
the
hastily
arranged
bed
and
snatch
all
the
hours
of
sleep
he
could
before
he
was
turned
out
at
first
it
must
be
admitted
he
felt
uncomfortable
distinctly
uncomfortable
he
was
in
some
one
else
room
he
had
really
no
right
to
be
there
it
was
in
the
nature
of
an
unwarrantable
intrusion
and
while
he
unpacked
he
kept
looking
over
his
shoulder
as
though
some
one
were
watching
him
from
the
corners
any
moment
it
seemed
he
would
hear
a
step
in
the
passage
a
knock
would
come
at
the
door
the
door
would
open
and
there
he
would
see
this
vigorous
englishwoman
looking
him
up
and
down
with
anger
worse
still
he
would
hear
her
voice
asking
him
what
he
was
doing
in
her
room
her
bedroom
of
course
he
had
an
adequate
explanation
but
still
then
reflecting
that
he
was
already
half
undressed
the
humour
of
it
flashed
for
a
second
across
his
mind
and
he
laughed
and
at
once
after
that
laughter
under
his
breath
came
the
sudden
sense
of
tragedy
he
had
felt
before
perhaps
even
while
he
smiled
her
body
lay
broken
and
cold
upon
those
awful
heights
the
wind
of
snow
playing
over
her
hair
her
glazed
eyes
staring
sightless
up
to
the
stars
it
made
him
shudder
the
sense
of
this
woman
whom
he
had
never
seen
whose
name
even
he
did
not
know
became
extraordinarily
real
almost
he
could
imagine
that
she
was
somewhere
in
the
room
with
him
hidden
observing
all
he
did
he
opened
the
door
softly
to
put
his
boots
outside
and
when
he
closed
it
again
he
turned
the
key
then
he
finished
unpacking
and
distributed
his
few
things
about
the
room
it
was
soon
done
for
in
the
first
place
he
had
only
a
small
gladstone
and
a
knapsack
and
secondly
the
only
place
where
he
could
spread
his
clothes
was
the
sofa
there
was
no
chest
of
drawers
and
the
cupboard
an
unusually
large
and
solid
one
was
locked
the
englishwoman
things
had
evidently
been
hastily
put
away
in
it
the
only
sign
of
her
recent
presence
was
a
bunch
of
faded
standing
in
a
glass
jar
upon
the
washhand
stand
this
and
a
certain
faint
perfume
were
all
that
remained
in
spite
however
of
these
very
slight
evidences
the
whole
room
was
pervaded
with
a
curious
sense
of
occupancy
that
he
found
exceedingly
distasteful
one
moment
the
atmosphere
seemed
subtly
charged
with
a
just
left
feeling
the
next
it
was
a
queer
awareness
of
still
here
that
made
him
turn
cold
and
look
hurriedly
behind
him
altogether
the
room
inspired
him
with
a
singular
aversion
and
the
strength
of
this
aversion
seemed
the
only
excuse
for
his
tossing
the
faded
flowers
out
of
the
window
and
then
hanging
his
mackintosh
upon
the
cupboard
door
in
such
a
way
as
to
screen
it
as
much
as
possible
from
view
for
the
sight
of
that
big
ugly
cupboard
filled
with
the
clothing
of
a
woman
who
might
then
be
beyond
any
further
need
of
covering
thus
his
imagination
insisted
on
picturing
it
touched
in
him
a
startled
sense
of
the
incongruous
that
did
not
stop
there
but
crept
through
his
mind
gradually
till
it
merged
somehow
into
a
sense
of
a
rather
grotesque
horror
at
any
rate
the
sight
of
that
cupboard
was
offensive
and
he
covered
it
almost
instinctively
then
turning
out
the
electric
light
he
got
into
bed
but
the
instant
the
room
was
dark
he
realised
that
it
was
more
than
he
could
stand
for
with
the
blackness
there
came
a
sudden
rush
of
cold
that
he
found
it
hard
to
explain
and
the
odd
thing
was
that
when
he
lit
the
candle
beside
his
bed
he
noticed
that
his
hand
trembled
this
of
course
was
too
much
his
imagination
was
taking
liberties
and
must
be
called
to
heel
yet
the
way
he
called
it
to
order
was
significant
and
its
very
deliberateness
betrayed
a
mind
that
has
already
admitted
fear
and
fear
once
in
is
difficult
to
dislodge
he
lay
there
upon
his
elbow
in
bed
and
carefully
took
note
of
all
the
objects
in
the
room
with
the
intention
as
it
were
of
taking
an
inventory
of
everything
his
senses
perceived
then
drawing
a
line
adding
them
up
finally
and
saying
with
decision
that
all
the
room
contains
i
counted
every
single
thing
there
is
nothing
more
i
may
sleep
in
peace
and
it
was
during
this
absurd
process
of
enumerating
the
furniture
of
the
room
that
the
dreadful
sense
of
distressing
lassitude
came
over
him
that
made
it
difficult
even
to
finish
counting
it
came
swiftly
yet
with
an
amazing
kind
of
violence
that
overwhelmed
him
softly
and
easily
with
a
sensation
of
enervating
weariness
hard
to
describe
and
its
first
effect
was
to
banish
fear
he
no
longer
possessed
enough
energy
to
feel
really
afraid
or
nervous
the
cold
remained
but
the
alarm
vanished
and
into
every
corner
of
his
usually
vigorous
personality
crept
the
insidious
poison
of
a
fatigue
at
first
that
in
a
few
seconds
it
seemed
translated
itself
into
inertia
a
sudden
consciousness
of
the
foolishness
the
crass
futility
of
life
of
effort
of
fighting
of
all
that
makes
life
worth
living
shot
into
every
fibre
of
his
being
and
left
him
utterly
weak
a
spirit
of
black
pessimism
that
was
not
even
vigorous
enough
to
assert
itself
invaded
the
secret
chambers
of
his
heart
every
picture
that
presented
itself
to
his
mind
came
dressed
in
grey
shadows
those
bored
and
sweating
horses
toiling
up
the
ascent
to
nothing
that
landlady
taking
so
much
trouble
to
let
her
desire
for
gain
conquer
her
sense
of
morality
for
a
few
francs
that
porter
so
talkative
fussy
energetic
and
so
anxious
to
tell
all
he
knew
what
was
the
use
of
them
all
and
for
himself
what
in
the
world
was
the
good
of
all
the
labour
and
drudgery
he
went
through
in
that
preparatory
school
where
he
was
junior
master
what
could
it
lead
to
wherein
lay
the
value
of
so
much
uncertain
toil
when
the
ultimate
secrets
of
life
were
hidden
and
no
one
knew
the
final
goal
how
foolish
was
effort
discipline
work
how
vain
was
pleasure
how
trivial
the
noblest
life
with
a
fearful
jump
that
nearly
upset
the
candle
minturn
pulled
himself
together
such
vicious
thoughts
were
usually
so
remote
from
his
normal
character
that
the
sudden
vile
invasion
produced
a
swift
reaction
yet
only
for
a
moment
instantly
again
the
black
depression
descended
upon
him
like
a
wave
his
work
it
could
lead
to
nothing
but
the
dreary
labour
of
a
small
headmastership
after
all
seemed
as
vain
and
foolish
as
his
holiday
in
the
alps
what
an
idiot
he
had
been
to
be
sure
to
come
out
with
a
knapsack
merely
to
work
himself
into
a
state
of
exhaustion
climbing
over
toilsome
mountains
that
led
to
nowhere
resulted
in
nothing
a
dreariness
of
the
grave
possessed
him
life
was
a
ghastly
fraud
religion
childish
humbug
everything
was
merely
a
trap
a
trap
of
death
a
coloured
toy
that
nature
used
as
a
decoy
but
a
decoy
for
what
for
nothing
there
was
no
meaning
in
anything
the
only
thing
was
death
and
the
happiest
people
were
those
who
found
it
soonest
why
wait
for
it
to
come
he
sprang
out
of
bed
thoroughly
frightened
this
was
horrible
surely
mere
physical
fatigue
could
not
produce
a
world
so
black
an
outlook
so
dismal
a
cowardice
that
struck
with
such
sudden
hopelessness
at
the
very
roots
of
life
for
normally
he
was
cheerful
and
strong
full
of
the
tides
of
healthy
living
and
this
appalling
lassitude
swept
the
very
basis
of
his
personality
into
nothingness
and
the
desire
for
death
it
was
like
the
development
of
a
secondary
personality
he
had
read
of
course
how
certain
persons
who
suffered
shocks
developed
thereafter
entirely
different
characteristics
memory
tastes
and
so
forth
it
had
all
rather
frightened
him
though
scientific
men
vouched
for
it
it
was
hardly
to
be
believed
yet
here
was
a
similar
thing
taking
place
in
his
own
consciousness
he
was
beyond
question
experiencing
all
the
mental
variations
of
one
it
was
it
was
awful
it
was
well
after
all
at
the
same
time
it
was
uncommonly
interesting
and
this
interest
he
began
to
feel
was
the
first
sign
of
his
returning
normal
self
for
to
feel
interest
is
to
live
and
to
love
life
he
sprang
into
the
middle
of
the
room
then
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
the
first
thing
that
struck
his
eye
was
the
big
cupboard
hallo
there
that
beastly
cupboard
he
exclaimed
to
himself
involuntarily
yet
aloud
it
held
all
the
clothes
the
swinging
skirts
and
coats
and
summer
blouses
of
the
dead
woman
for
he
knew
now
somehow
or
other
that
she
dead
at
that
moment
through
the
open
windows
rushed
the
sound
of
falling
water
bringing
with
it
a
vivid
realisation
of
the
desolate
heights
he
saw
her
positively
her
lying
where
she
had
fallen
the
frost
upon
her
cheeks
the
eddying
about
her
hair
and
eyes
her
broken
limbs
pushing
against
the
lumps
of
ice
for
a
moment
the
sense
of
spiritual
lassitude
of
the
emptiness
of
life
vanished
before
this
picture
of
broken
effort
of
a
small
human
force
battling
pluckily
yet
in
vain
against
the
impersonal
and
pitiless
potencies
of
inanimate
nature
and
he
found
himself
again
his
normal
self
then
instantly
returned
again
that
terrible
sense
of
cold
nothingness
emptiness
and
he
found
himself
standing
opposite
the
big
cupboard
where
her
clothes
were
he
wanted
to
see
those
clothes
things
she
had
used
and
worn
quite
close
he
stood
almost
touching
it
the
next
second
he
had
touched
it
his
knuckles
struck
upon
the
wood
why
he
knocked
is
hard
to
say
it
was
an
instinctive
movement
probably
something
in
his
deepest
self
dictated
it
ordered
it
he
knocked
at
the
door
and
the
dull
sound
upon
the
wood
into
the
stillness
of
that
room
brought
horror
why
it
should
have
done
so
he
found
it
as
hard
to
explain
to
himself
as
why
he
should
have
felt
impelled
to
knock
the
fact
remains
that
when
he
heard
the
faint
reverberation
inside
the
cupboard
it
brought
with
it
so
vivid
a
realisation
of
the
presence
that
he
stood
there
shivering
upon
the
floor
with
a
dreadful
sense
of
anticipation
he
almost
expected
to
hear
an
answering
knock
from
within
the
rustling
of
the
hanging
skirts
perhaps
or
worse
still
to
see
the
locked
door
slowly
open
towards
him
and
from
that
moment
he
declares
that
in
some
way
or
other
he
must
have
partially
lost
control
of
himself
or
at
least
of
his
better
judgment
for
he
became
possessed
by
such
an
overmastering
desire
to
tear
open
that
cupboard
door
and
see
the
clothes
within
that
he
tried
every
key
in
the
room
in
the
vain
effort
to
unlock
it
and
then
finally
before
he
quite
realised
what
he
was
doing
rang
the
bell
but
having
rung
the
bell
for
no
obvious
or
intelligent
reason
at
two
in
the
morning
he
then
stood
waiting
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
for
the
servant
to
come
conscious
for
the
first
time
that
something
outside
his
ordinary
self
had
pushed
him
towards
the
act
it
was
almost
like
an
internal
voice
that
directed
him
and
thus
when
at
last
steps
came
down
the
passage
and
he
faced
the
cross
and
sleepy
chambermaid
amazed
at
being
summoned
at
such
an
hour
he
found
no
difficulty
in
the
matter
of
what
he
should
say
for
the
same
power
that
insisted
he
should
open
the
cupboard
door
also
impelled
him
to
utter
words
over
which
he
apparently
had
no
control
it
not
i
rang
for
he
said
with
decision
and
impatience
i
want
a
man
wake
the
porter
and
send
him
up
to
me
at
once
hurry
i
tell
you
hurry
and
when
the
girl
had
gone
frightened
at
his
earnestness
minturn
realised
that
the
words
surprised
himself
as
much
as
they
surprised
her
until
they
were
out
of
his
mouth
he
had
not
known
what
exactly
he
was
saying
but
now
he
understood
that
some
force
foreign
to
his
own
personality
was
using
his
mind
and
organs
the
black
depression
that
had
possessed
him
a
few
moments
before
was
also
part
of
it
the
powerful
mood
of
this
vanished
woman
had
somehow
momentarily
taken
possession
of
him
communicated
possibly
by
the
atmosphere
of
things
in
the
room
still
belonging
to
her
but
even
now
when
the
porter
without
coat
or
collar
stood
beside
him
in
the
room
he
did
not
understand
he
insisted
with
a
positive
fury
admitting
no
denial
that
the
key
of
that
cupboard
must
be
found
and
the
door
instantly
opened
the
scene
was
a
curious
one
after
some
perplexed
whispering
with
the
chambermaid
at
the
end
of
the
passage
the
porter
managed
to
find
and
produce
the
key
in
question
neither
he
nor
the
girl
knew
clearly
what
this
excited
englishman
was
up
to
or
why
he
was
so
passionately
intent
upon
opening
the
cupboard
at
two
in
the
morning
they
watched
him
with
an
air
of
wondering
what
was
going
to
happen
next
but
something
of
his
curious
earnestness
even
of
his
late
fear
communicated
itself
to
them
and
the
sound
of
the
key
grating
in
the
lock
made
them
both
jump
they
held
their
breath
as
the
creaking
door
swung
slowly
open
all
heard
the
clatter
of
that
other
key
as
it
fell
against
the
wooden
floor
within
the
cupboard
had
been
locked
the
but
it
was
the
scared
housemaid
from
her
position
in
the
corridor
who
first
saw
and
with
a
wild
scream
fell
crashing
against
the
bannisters
the
porter
made
no
attempt
to
save
her
the
schoolmaster
and
himself
made
a
simultaneous
rush
towards
the
door
now
wide
open
they
too
had
seen
there
were
no
clothes
skirts
or
blouses
on
the
pegs
but
all
by
itself
from
an
iron
hook
in
the
centre
they
saw
the
body
of
the
englishwoman
hanging
by
the
neck
the
head
bent
horribly
forwards
the
tongue
protruding
jarred
by
the
movement
of
unlocking
the
body
swung
slowly
round
to
face
them
pinned
upon
the
inside
of
the
door
was
a
hotel
envelope
with
the
following
words
pencilled
in
straggling
writing
tired
unhappy
hopelessly
depressed
i
can
not
face
life
any
longer
all
is
black
i
must
put
an
end
to
it
i
meant
to
do
it
on
the
mountains
but
was
afraid
i
slipped
back
to
my
room
unobserved
this
way
is
easiest
and
best
viii
cain
atonement
so
many
thousands
have
deliberately
put
self
aside
and
are
ready
to
yield
their
lives
for
an
ideal
that
it
is
not
surprising
a
few
of
them
should
have
registered
experiences
of
a
novel
order
for
to
step
aside
from
self
is
to
enter
a
larger
world
to
be
open
to
new
impressions
if
powers
of
good
exist
in
the
universe
at
all
they
can
hardly
be
inactive
at
the
present
time
the
case
of
two
men
who
may
be
called
jones
and
smith
occurs
to
the
mind
in
this
connection
whether
a
veil
actually
was
lifted
for
a
moment
or
whether
the
tension
of
long
and
terrible
months
resulted
in
an
exaltation
of
emotion
the
experience
claims
significance
smith
to
whom
the
experience
came
holds
the
firm
belief
that
it
was
real
jones
though
it
involved
him
too
remained
unaware
it
is
a
somewhat
personal
story
their
peculiar
relationship
dating
from
early
youth
a
kind
of
unwilling
antipathy
was
born
between
them
yet
an
antipathy
that
had
no
touch
of
hate
or
even
of
dislike
it
was
rather
in
the
nature
of
an
instinctive
rivalry
some
tie
operated
that
flung
them
ever
into
the
same
arena
with
strange
persistence
and
ever
as
opponents
an
inevitable
fate
delighted
to
throw
them
together
in
a
sense
that
made
them
rivals
small
as
well
as
large
affairs
betrayed
this
malicious
tendency
of
the
gods
it
showed
itself
in
earliest
days
at
school
at
cambridge
in
travel
even
in
and
the
lighter
social
intercourse
though
distant
cousins
their
families
were
not
intimate
and
there
was
no
obvious
reason
why
their
paths
should
fall
so
persistently
together
yet
their
paths
did
so
crossing
and
recrossing
in
the
way
described
sooner
or
later
in
all
his
undertakings
smith
would
note
the
shadow
of
jones
darkening
the
ground
in
front
of
him
and
later
when
called
to
the
bar
in
his
chosen
profession
he
found
most
frequently
that
the
learned
counsel
in
opposition
to
him
was
the
owner
of
this
shadow
jones
in
another
matter
too
they
became
rivals
for
the
same
girl
oddly
enough
attracted
both
and
though
she
accepted
neither
offer
of
marriage
during
smith
lifetime
the
attitude
between
them
was
that
of
unwilling
rivals
for
they
were
friends
as
well
jones
it
appears
was
hardly
aware
that
any
rivalry
existed
he
did
not
think
of
smith
as
an
opponent
and
as
an
adversary
never
he
did
notice
however
the
constantly
recurring
meetings
for
more
than
once
he
commented
on
them
with
amusement
smith
on
the
other
hand
was
conscious
of
a
depth
and
strength
in
the
tie
that
certainly
intrigued
him
being
of
a
thoughtful
introspective
nature
he
was
keenly
sensible
of
the
strange
competition
in
their
lives
and
sought
in
various
ways
for
its
explanation
though
without
success
the
desire
to
find
out
was
very
strong
in
him
and
this
was
natural
enough
owing
to
the
singular
fact
that
in
all
their
battles
he
was
the
one
to
lose
invariably
jones
got
the
best
of
every
conflict
smith
always
paid
sometimes
he
paid
with
interest
occasionally
too
he
seemed
forced
to
injure
himself
while
contributing
to
his
cousin
success
it
was
very
curious
he
reflected
much
upon
it
he
wondered
what
the
origin
of
their
tie
and
rivalry
might
be
but
especially
why
it
was
that
he
invariably
lost
and
why
he
was
so
often
obliged
to
help
his
rival
to
the
point
even
of
his
own
detriment
tempted
to
bitterness
sometimes
he
did
not
yield
to
it
however
the
relationship
remained
frank
and
pleasant
if
anything
it
deepened
he
remembered
once
for
instance
giving
his
cousin
a
chance
introduction
which
yet
led
a
little
later
to
the
third
party
offering
certain
evidence
which
lost
him
an
important
case
jones
of
course
winning
it
the
third
party
too
angry
at
being
dragged
into
the
case
turned
hostile
to
him
thwarting
various
subsequent
projects
in
no
other
way
could
jones
have
procured
this
particular
evidence
he
did
not
know
of
its
existence
even
that
chance
introduction
did
it
all
there
was
nothing
the
least
dishonourable
on
the
part
of
jones
it
was
just
the
chance
of
the
dice
the
dice
were
always
loaded
against
smith
and
there
were
other
instances
of
similar
kind
about
this
time
moreover
a
singular
feeling
that
had
lain
vaguely
in
his
mind
for
some
years
past
took
more
definite
form
it
suddenly
assumed
the
character
of
a
conviction
that
yet
had
no
evidence
to
support
it
a
voice
long
whispering
in
the
depths
of
him
became
much
louder
grew
into
a
statement
that
he
accepted
without
further
ado
i
paying
off
a
debt
he
phrased
it
an
old
old
debt
is
being
discharged
i
owe
him
this
my
help
and
so
forth
he
accepted
it
that
is
as
just
and
this
certainty
of
justice
kept
sweet
his
heart
and
mind
shutting
the
door
on
bitterness
or
envy
the
thought
however
though
it
recurred
persistently
with
each
encounter
brought
no
explanation
when
the
war
broke
out
both
offered
their
services
as
members
of
the
they
got
commissions
quickly
but
it
was
a
chance
remark
of
smith
that
made
his
friend
join
the
very
regiment
he
himself
was
in
they
trained
together
were
in
the
same
retreats
and
the
same
advances
together
their
friendship
deepened
under
the
stress
of
circumstances
the
tie
did
not
dissolve
but
strengthened
it
was
indubitably
real
therefore
then
oddly
enough
they
were
both
wounded
in
the
same
engagement
and
it
was
here
the
remarkable
fate
that
jointly
haunted
them
betrayed
itself
more
clearly
than
in
any
previous
incident
of
their
long
relationship
smith
was
wounded
in
the
act
of
protecting
his
cousin
how
it
happened
is
confusing
to
a
layman
but
each
apparently
was
leading
a
and
the
two
parties
came
together
they
found
themselves
shoulder
to
shoulder
both
brimmed
with
that
pluck
which
is
complete
indifference
to
self
they
exchanged
a
word
of
excited
greeting
and
the
same
second
one
of
those
rare
opportunities
of
advantage
presented
itself
which
only
the
highest
courage
could
make
use
of
neither
certainly
was
thinking
of
personal
reward
it
was
merely
that
each
saw
the
chance
by
which
instant
heroism
might
gain
a
surprise
advantage
for
their
side
the
risk
was
heavy
but
there
a
chance
and
success
would
mean
a
decisive
result
to
say
nothing
of
high
distinction
for
the
man
who
obtained
it
if
he
survived
smith
being
a
few
yards
ahead
of
his
cousin
had
the
moment
in
his
grasp
he
was
in
the
act
of
dashing
forward
when
something
made
him
pause
a
bomb
in
flung
from
the
opposing
trench
was
falling
it
seemed
immediately
above
him
he
saw
that
it
would
just
miss
himself
but
land
full
upon
his
cousin
whose
head
was
turned
the
other
way
by
stretching
out
his
hand
smith
knew
he
could
field
it
like
a
cricket
ball
there
was
an
interval
of
a
second
and
a
half
he
judged
he
hesitated
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
second
then
he
acted
he
caught
it
it
was
the
obvious
thing
to
do
he
flung
it
back
into
the
opposing
trench
the
rapidity
of
thought
is
hard
to
realise
in
that
second
and
a
half
smith
was
aware
of
many
things
he
saved
his
cousin
life
unquestionably
unquestionably
also
jones
seized
the
opportunity
that
otherwise
was
his
cousin
but
it
was
neither
of
these
reflections
that
filled
smith
mind
the
dominant
impression
was
another
it
flashed
into
actual
words
inside
his
excited
brain
i
must
risk
it
i
owe
it
to
him
and
more
besides
he
was
further
aware
of
another
impulse
than
the
obvious
one
in
the
first
fraction
of
a
second
it
was
overwhelmingly
established
and
it
was
this
that
the
entire
episode
was
familiar
to
him
a
subtle
familiarity
was
present
all
this
had
happened
before
he
had
already
somewhere
somehow
seen
death
descending
upon
his
cousin
from
the
air
yet
with
a
difference
the
difference
escaped
him
the
familiarity
was
vivid
that
he
missed
the
deadly
detonators
in
making
the
catch
or
that
the
fuse
delayed
he
called
good
luck
he
only
remembers
that
he
flung
the
gruesome
weapon
back
whence
it
had
come
and
that
its
explosion
in
the
opposite
trench
materially
helped
his
cousin
to
find
glory
in
the
place
of
death
the
slight
delay
however
resulted
in
his
receiving
a
bullet
through
the
chest
a
bullet
he
would
not
otherwise
have
received
presumably
it
was
some
days
later
gravely
wounded
that
he
discovered
his
cousin
in
another
bed
across
the
darkened
floor
they
exchanged
remarks
jones
was
already
decorated
it
seemed
having
snatched
success
from
his
cousin
hands
while
little
aware
whose
help
had
made
it
easier
and
once
again
there
stole
across
the
inmost
mind
of
smith
that
strange
insistent
whisper
i
owed
it
to
him
but
by
god
i
owe
more
than
that
i
mean
to
pay
it
too
there
was
not
a
trace
of
bitterness
or
envy
now
only
this
profound
conviction
of
obscurest
origin
that
it
was
right
and
absolutely
just
full
honest
repayment
of
a
debt
incurred
some
ancient
balance
of
account
was
being
settled
there
was
no
chance
injustice
and
caprice
played
no
role
at
all
and
a
deeper
understanding
of
ironies
crept
into
him
for
if
everything
was
there
was
no
room
for
whimpering
and
the
voice
persisted
above
the
sound
of
busy
footsteps
in
the
ward
i
owe
it
i
pay
it
gladly
through
the
pain
and
weakness
the
whisper
died
away
he
was
exhausted
there
were
periods
of
unconsciousness
but
there
were
periods
of
as
well
then
flashes
of
another
kind
of
consciousness
altogether
when
bathed
in
high
soft
light
he
was
aware
of
things
he
could
not
quite
account
for
he
it
was
absolutely
real
only
the
critical
faculty
was
gone
he
did
not
question
what
he
saw
as
he
stared
across
at
his
cousin
bed
he
knew
perhaps
the
beaten
body
let
something
through
at
last
the
nerves
to
numbness
lay
very
still
the
physical
system
battered
and
depleted
made
no
cry
the
clamour
of
the
flesh
was
hushed
he
was
aware
however
of
an
undeniable
exaltation
of
the
spirit
in
him
as
he
lay
and
gazed
towards
his
cousin
bed
across
the
night
of
time
it
seemed
to
him
the
picture
stole
before
his
inner
eye
with
a
certainty
that
left
no
room
for
doubt
it
was
not
the
cells
of
memory
in
his
brain
of
that
gave
up
their
dead
it
was
the
eternal
self
in
him
that
remembered
and
understood
the
soul
with
that
satisfaction
which
is
born
of
full
comprehension
he
watched
the
light
glow
and
spread
about
the
little
bed
thick
matting
deadened
the
footsteps
of
nurses
orderlies
doctors
new
cases
were
brought
in
old
cases
were
carried
out
he
ignored
them
he
saw
only
the
light
above
his
cousin
bed
grow
stronger
he
lay
still
and
stared
it
came
neither
from
the
ceiling
nor
the
floor
it
unfolded
like
a
cloud
of
shining
smoke
and
the
little
lamp
the
sheets
the
figure
framed
between
them
all
these
slid
cleverly
away
and
vanished
utterly
he
stood
in
another
place
that
had
lain
behind
all
these
appearances
a
landscape
with
wooded
hills
a
foaming
river
the
sun
just
sinking
below
the
forest
and
dusk
creeping
from
a
gorge
along
the
lonely
banks
in
the
warm
air
there
was
a
perfume
of
great
flowers
and
trees
there
were
and
the
taste
of
spray
from
the
tumbling
river
was
on
his
lips
across
the
water
a
large
bird
flapped
its
heavy
wings
as
it
moved
to
find
another
fishing
place
for
he
and
his
companion
had
disturbed
it
as
they
broke
out
of
the
thick
foliage
and
reached
the
the
companion
moreover
was
his
brother
they
ever
hunted
together
there
was
a
passionate
link
between
them
born
of
blood
and
of
affection
they
were
twins
it
all
was
as
clear
as
though
of
yesterday
in
his
heart
was
the
lust
of
the
hunt
in
his
blood
was
the
lust
of
woman
and
thick
behind
these
lurked
the
jealousy
and
fierce
desire
of
a
primitive
day
but
though
clear
as
of
yesterday
he
knew
that
it
was
of
long
long
ago
and
his
brother
came
up
close
beside
him
resting
his
bloody
spear
with
a
clattering
sound
against
the
boulders
on
the
shore
he
saw
the
gleaming
of
the
metal
in
the
sunset
he
saw
the
shining
glitter
of
the
spray
upon
the
boulders
he
saw
his
brother
eyes
look
straight
into
his
own
and
in
them
shone
a
light
that
was
neither
the
reflection
of
the
sunset
nor
the
excitement
of
the
hunt
just
over
it
escaped
us
said
his
brother
yet
i
know
my
first
spear
struck
it
followed
the
fawn
that
crossed
was
the
reply
besides
we
came
down
wind
thus
giving
it
warning
our
flocks
at
any
rate
are
safer
the
other
laughed
significantly
it
is
not
the
safety
of
our
flocks
that
troubles
me
just
now
brother
he
interrupted
eagerly
while
the
light
burned
more
deeply
in
his
eyes
it
is
rather
that
waits
for
me
by
the
fire
across
the
river
and
that
i
would
get
to
her
with
your
help
added
to
my
love
he
went
on
in
a
trusting
voice
the
gods
have
shown
me
the
favour
of
true
happiness
he
pointed
with
his
spear
to
a
on
the
farther
bank
turning
his
head
as
he
strode
to
plunge
into
the
stream
and
swim
across
for
an
instant
then
the
other
felt
his
natural
love
turn
into
bitter
hate
his
own
fierce
passion
unconfessed
concealed
burst
into
instant
flame
that
the
girl
should
become
his
brother
wife
sent
the
blood
surging
through
his
veins
in
fury
he
felt
his
life
and
all
that
he
desired
go
down
in
ashes
he
watched
his
brother
stride
towards
the
water
the
cast
across
one
naked
shoulder
when
another
object
caught
his
practised
eye
in
it
passed
suddenly
like
a
shining
gleam
it
seemed
to
hang
a
second
then
it
swept
swiftly
forward
past
his
head
and
downward
it
had
leaped
with
a
blazing
fury
from
the
overhanging
bank
behind
he
saw
the
blood
still
streaming
from
its
wounded
flank
it
must
land
he
saw
it
with
a
secret
awful
pleasure
full
upon
the
striding
figure
whose
head
was
turned
away
the
swiftness
of
that
leap
however
was
not
so
swift
but
that
he
could
easily
have
used
his
spear
indeed
he
gripped
it
strongly
his
skill
his
strength
his
aim
he
knew
them
well
enough
but
hate
and
love
fastening
upon
his
heart
held
all
his
muscles
still
he
hesitated
he
was
no
murderer
yet
he
paused
he
heard
the
roar
the
ugly
thud
the
crash
the
cry
for
help
too
late
and
when
an
instant
afterwards
his
steel
plunged
into
the
great
beast
heart
the
human
heart
and
life
he
might
have
saved
lay
still
for
ever
he
heard
the
water
rushing
past
an
icy
wind
came
down
the
gorge
against
his
naked
back
he
saw
the
fire
shine
upon
the
farther
bank
and
the
figure
of
a
girl
in
skins
was
wading
across
seeking
out
the
shallow
places
in
the
dusk
and
calling
wildly
as
she
came
then
darkness
hid
the
entire
landscape
yet
a
darkness
that
was
deeper
bluer
than
the
velvet
of
the
night
alone
and
he
shrieked
aloud
in
his
remorseful
anguish
may
the
gods
forgive
me
for
i
did
not
mean
it
oh
that
i
might
undo
that
i
might
repay
that
his
cries
disturbed
the
weary
occupants
in
more
than
one
bed
is
certain
but
he
remembers
chiefly
that
a
nurse
was
quickly
by
his
side
and
that
something
she
gave
him
soothed
his
violent
pain
and
helped
him
into
deeper
sleep
again
there
was
he
noticed
anyhow
no
longer
the
soft
clear
blazing
light
about
his
cousin
bed
he
saw
only
the
faint
glitter
of
the
down
the
length
of
the
great
room
and
some
weeks
later
he
went
back
to
fight
the
picture
however
never
left
his
memory
it
stayed
with
him
as
an
actual
reality
that
was
neither
delusion
nor
hallucination
he
believed
that
he
understood
at
last
the
meaning
of
the
tie
that
had
fettered
him
and
puzzled
him
so
long
the
memory
of
those
days
of
shepherding
beneath
the
stars
of
long
ago
remained
vividly
beside
him
he
kept
his
secret
however
in
many
a
talk
with
his
cousin
beneath
the
nearer
stars
of
flanders
no
word
of
it
ever
passed
his
lips
the
friendship
between
them
meanwhile
experienced
a
curious
deepening
though
unacknowledged
in
any
spoken
words
smith
at
any
rate
on
his
side
put
into
it
an
affection
that
was
a
brave
love
he
watched
over
his
cousin
in
the
fighting
especially
when
possible
he
sought
to
protect
and
shield
him
regardless
of
his
own
personal
safety
he
delighted
secretly
in
the
honours
his
cousin
had
already
won
he
himself
was
not
yet
even
mentioned
in
dispatches
and
no
public
distinction
of
any
kind
had
come
his
way
his
eventually
well
he
was
no
longer
occupying
his
body
when
it
was
bestowed
he
had
already
left
he
was
now
conscious
possibly
of
other
experiences
besides
that
one
of
ancient
primitive
days
when
he
and
his
brother
were
shepherding
beneath
other
stars
but
the
reckless
heroism
which
saved
his
cousin
under
fire
may
later
enshrine
another
memory
which
at
some
far
future
time
shall
reawaken
as
a
hallucination
from
a
past
that
is
called
the
present
the
notion
at
any
rate
flashed
across
his
mind
before
he
left
ix
an
egyptian
hornet
the
word
has
an
angry
malignant
sound
that
brings
the
idea
of
attack
vividly
into
the
mind
there
is
a
vicious
sting
about
it
somewhere
even
a
foreigner
ignorant
of
the
meaning
must
feel
it
a
hornet
is
wicked
it
darts
and
stabs
it
pierces
aiming
without
provocation
for
the
face
and
eyes
the
name
suggests
a
metallic
droning
of
evil
wings
fierce
flight
and
poisonous
assault
though
black
and
yellow
it
sounds
scarlet
there
is
blood
in
it
a
striped
tiger
of
the
air
in
concentrated
form
there
is
no
escape
if
it
attacks
in
egypt
an
ordinary
bee
is
the
size
of
an
english
hornet
but
the
egyptian
hornet
is
enormous
it
is
truly
monstrous
an
ominous
dying
terror
it
shares
that
universal
quality
of
the
land
of
the
sphinx
and
pyramids
great
size
it
is
a
formidable
insect
worse
than
scorpion
or
tarantula
the
rev
james
milligan
meeting
one
for
the
first
time
realised
the
meaning
of
another
word
as
well
a
word
he
used
prolifically
in
his
eloquent
sermons
devil
one
morning
in
april
when
the
heat
began
to
bring
the
insects
out
he
rose
as
usual
betimes
and
went
across
the
wide
stone
corridor
to
his
bath
the
desert
already
glared
in
through
the
open
windows
the
heat
would
be
afflicting
later
in
the
day
but
at
this
early
hour
the
cool
north
wind
blew
pleasantly
down
the
hotel
passages
it
was
sunday
and
at
eight
he
would
appear
to
conduct
the
morning
service
for
the
english
visitors
the
floor
of
the
was
cold
beneath
his
feet
in
their
thin
native
slippers
of
bright
yellow
he
was
neither
young
nor
old
his
salary
was
comfortable
he
had
a
competency
of
his
own
without
wife
or
children
to
absorb
it
the
dry
climate
had
been
recommended
to
him
and
the
big
hotel
took
him
in
for
next
to
nothing
and
he
was
thoroughly
pleased
with
himself
for
he
was
a
sleek
vain
pompous
personality
but
mean
as
a
rat
no
worries
of
any
kind
were
on
his
mind
as
carrying
sponge
and
towel
scented
soap
and
a
bottle
of
scrubb
ammonia
he
travelled
amiably
across
the
deserted
shining
corridor
to
the
bathroom
and
nothing
went
wrong
with
the
rev
james
milligan
until
he
opened
the
door
and
his
eye
fell
upon
a
dark
object
clinging
to
the
in
front
of
him
and
even
then
at
first
he
felt
no
anxiety
or
alarm
but
merely
a
natural
curiosity
to
know
exactly
what
it
was
this
little
clot
of
an
elongated
thing
that
stuck
there
on
the
wooden
framework
six
feet
before
his
aquiline
nose
he
went
straight
up
to
it
to
see
then
stopped
dead
his
heart
gave
a
distinct
unclerical
leap
his
lips
formed
themselves
into
unregenerate
shape
he
gasped
good
god
what
is
it
for
something
unholy
something
wicked
as
a
secret
sin
stuck
there
before
his
eyes
in
the
patch
of
blazing
sunshine
he
caught
his
breath
for
a
moment
he
was
unable
to
move
as
though
the
sight
half
fascinated
him
then
cautiously
and
very
slowly
stealthily
in
fact
he
withdrew
towards
the
door
he
had
just
entered
fearful
of
making
the
smallest
sound
he
retraced
his
steps
on
tiptoe
his
yellow
slippers
shuffled
his
dry
sponge
fell
and
bounded
till
it
settled
rolling
close
beneath
the
horribly
attractive
object
facing
him
from
the
safety
of
the
open
door
with
ample
space
for
retreat
behind
him
he
paused
and
stared
his
entire
being
focused
itself
in
his
eyes
it
was
a
hornet
that
he
saw
it
hung
there
motionless
and
threatening
between
him
and
the
bathroom
door
and
at
first
he
merely
exclaimed
below
his
breath
good
god
it
an
egyptian
hornet
being
a
man
with
a
reputation
for
decided
action
however
he
soon
recovered
himself
he
was
well
schooled
in
when
people
left
his
church
at
the
beginning
of
the
sermon
no
muscle
of
his
face
betrayed
the
wounded
vanity
and
annoyance
that
burned
deep
in
his
heart
but
a
hornet
sitting
directly
in
his
path
was
a
very
different
matter
he
realised
in
a
flash
that
he
was
poorly
clothed
in
a
word
that
he
was
practically
half
naked
from
a
distance
he
examined
this
intrusion
of
the
devil
it
was
calm
and
very
still
it
was
wonderfully
made
both
before
and
behind
its
wings
were
folded
upon
its
terrible
body
long
sinuous
things
pointed
like
temptation
barbed
as
well
stuck
out
of
it
there
was
poison
and
yet
grace
in
its
exquisite
presentment
its
shiny
black
was
beautiful
and
the
yellow
stripes
upon
its
sleek
curved
abdomen
were
like
the
gleaming
ornaments
upon
some
feminine
body
of
the
seductive
world
he
preached
against
almost
he
saw
an
abandoned
dancer
on
the
stage
and
then
swiftly
in
his
impressionable
soul
the
simile
changed
and
he
saw
instead
more
blunt
and
aggressive
forms
of
destruction
the
body
tapering
to
a
horrid
point
reminded
him
of
those
perfect
engines
of
death
that
reduce
hundreds
to
annihilation
unawares
torpedoes
shells
projectiles
crammed
with
secret
desolating
powers
its
wings
its
awful
quiet
head
its
delicate
slim
waist
its
stripes
of
brilliant
saffron
all
these
seemed
the
concentrated
prototype
of
abominations
made
cleverly
by
the
brain
of
man
and
beautifully
painted
to
disguise
their
invisible
freight
of
cruel
death
bah
he
exclaimed
ashamed
of
his
prolific
imagination
it
only
a
hornet
after
all
an
insect
and
he
contrived
a
hurried
careful
plan
he
aimed
a
towel
at
it
rolled
up
into
a
ball
but
did
not
throw
it
he
might
miss
he
remembered
that
his
ankles
were
unprotected
instead
he
paused
again
examining
the
black
and
yellow
object
in
safe
retirement
near
the
door
as
one
day
he
hoped
to
watch
the
world
in
leisurely
retirement
in
the
country
it
did
not
move
it
was
fixed
and
terrible
it
made
no
sound
its
wings
were
folded
not
even
the
black
antennae
blunt
at
the
tips
like
clubs
showed
the
least
stir
or
tremble
it
breathed
however
he
watched
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
evil
body
it
breathed
air
in
and
out
as
he
himself
did
the
creature
he
realised
had
lungs
and
heart
and
organs
it
had
a
brain
its
mind
was
active
all
this
time
it
knew
it
was
being
watched
it
merely
waited
any
second
with
a
whiz
of
fury
and
with
perfect
accuracy
of
aim
it
might
dart
at
him
and
strike
if
he
threw
the
towel
and
missed
it
certainly
would
there
were
other
occupants
of
the
corridor
however
and
a
sound
of
steps
approaching
gave
him
the
decision
to
act
he
would
lose
his
bath
if
he
hesitated
much
longer
he
felt
ashamed
of
his
timidity
though
pusillanimity
was
the
word
thought
selected
owing
to
the
pulpit
vocabulary
it
was
his
habit
to
prefer
he
went
with
extreme
caution
towards
the
bathroom
door
passing
the
point
of
danger
so
close
that
his
skin
turned
hot
and
cold
with
one
foot
gingerly
extended
he
recovered
his
sponge
the
hornet
did
not
move
a
muscle
but
it
had
seen
him
pass
it
merely
waited
all
dangerous
insects
had
that
trick
it
knew
quite
well
he
was
inside
it
knew
quite
well
he
must
come
out
a
few
minutes
later
it
also
knew
quite
well
that
he
was
naked
once
inside
the
little
room
he
closed
the
door
with
exceeding
gentleness
lest
the
vibration
might
stir
the
fearful
insect
to
attack
the
bath
was
already
filled
and
he
plunged
to
his
neck
with
a
feeling
of
comparative
security
a
window
into
the
outside
passage
he
also
closed
so
that
nothing
could
possibly
come
in
and
steam
soon
charged
the
air
and
left
its
blurred
deposit
on
the
glass
for
ten
minutes
he
could
enjoy
himself
and
pretend
that
he
was
safe
for
ten
minutes
he
did
so
he
behaved
carelessly
as
though
nothing
mattered
and
as
though
all
the
courage
in
the
world
were
his
he
splashed
and
soaped
and
sponged
making
a
lot
of
reckless
noise
he
got
out
and
dried
himself
slowly
the
steam
subsided
the
air
grew
clearer
he
put
on
and
slippers
it
was
time
to
go
out
unable
to
devise
any
further
reason
for
delay
he
opened
the
door
softly
half
an
inch
peeped
out
and
instantly
closed
it
again
with
a
resounding
bang
he
had
heard
a
drone
of
wings
the
insect
had
left
its
perch
and
now
buzzed
upon
the
floor
directly
in
his
path
the
air
seemed
full
of
stings
he
felt
stabs
all
over
him
his
unprotected
portions
winced
with
the
expectancy
of
pain
the
beast
knew
he
was
coming
out
and
was
waiting
for
him
in
that
brief
instant
he
had
felt
its
sting
all
over
him
on
his
unprotected
ankles
on
his
back
his
neck
his
cheeks
in
his
eyes
and
on
the
bald
clearing
that
adorned
his
anglican
head
through
the
closed
door
he
heard
the
ominous
dull
murmur
of
his
striped
adversary
as
it
beat
its
angry
wings
its
oiled
and
wicked
sting
shot
in
and
out
with
fury
its
deft
legs
worked
he
saw
its
tiny
waist
already
writhing
with
the
lust
of
battle
ugh
that
tiny
waist
a
moment
steady
nerve
and
he
could
have
severed
that
cunning
body
from
the
directing
brain
with
one
swift
thrust
but
his
nerve
had
utterly
deserted
him
human
motives
even
in
the
professedly
holy
are
an
involved
affair
at
any
time
just
now
in
the
rev
james
milligan
they
were
quite
inextricably
mixed
he
claims
this
explanation
at
any
rate
in
excuse
of
his
abominable
subsequent
behaviour
for
exactly
at
this
moment
when
he
had
decided
to
admit
cowardice
by
ringing
for
the
arab
servant
a
step
was
audible
in
the
corridor
outside
and
courage
came
with
it
into
his
disreputable
heart
it
was
the
step
of
the
man
he
cordially
disapproved
of
using
the
pulpit
version
of
hated
and
despised
he
had
overstayed
his
time
and
the
bath
was
in
demand
by
mullins
mullins
invariably
followed
him
at
it
was
now
a
quarter
to
eight
and
mullins
was
a
wretched
drinking
man
a
sot
in
a
flash
the
plan
was
conceived
and
put
into
execution
the
temptation
of
course
was
of
the
devil
milligan
hid
the
motive
from
himself
pretending
he
hardly
recognised
it
the
plan
was
what
men
call
a
dirty
trick
it
was
also
irresistibly
seductive
he
opened
the
door
stepped
boldly
nose
in
the
air
right
over
the
hideous
insect
on
the
floor
and
fairly
pranced
into
the
outer
passage
the
brief
transit
brought
a
hundred
horrible
sensations
that
the
hornet
would
rise
and
sting
his
leg
that
it
would
cling
to
his
and
stab
his
spine
that
he
would
step
upon
it
and
die
like
achilles
of
a
heel
exposed
but
with
these
and
conquering
them
was
one
other
stronger
emotion
that
robbed
the
lesser
terrors
of
their
potency
that
mullins
would
run
precisely
the
same
risks
five
seconds
later
unprepared
he
heard
the
gloating
insect
buzz
and
scratch
the
but
it
was
behind
him
was
safe
good
morning
to
you
mullins
he
observed
with
a
gracious
smile
i
trust
i
have
not
kept
you
waiting
mornin
grunted
mullins
sourly
in
reply
as
he
passed
him
with
a
distinctly
hostile
and
contemptuous
air
for
mullins
though
depraved
perhaps
was
an
honest
man
abhorring
parsons
and
making
no
secret
of
his
opinions
whence
the
bitter
feeling
all
men
except
those
very
big
ones
who
are
supermen
have
something
astonishingly
despicable
in
them
the
despicable
thing
in
milligan
came
uppermost
now
he
fairly
chuckled
he
met
the
snub
with
a
calm
forgiving
smile
and
continued
his
shambling
gait
with
what
dignity
he
could
towards
his
bedroom
opposite
then
he
turned
his
head
to
see
his
enemy
would
meet
an
infuriated
hornet
an
egyptian
hornet
and
might
not
notice
it
he
might
step
on
it
he
might
not
but
he
was
bound
to
disturb
it
and
rouse
it
to
attack
the
chances
were
enormously
on
the
clerical
side
and
its
sting
meant
death
may
god
forgive
me
ran
subconsciously
through
his
mind
and
side
by
side
with
the
repentant
prayer
ran
also
a
recognition
of
the
eternal
skill
i
hope
the
devil
it
will
sting
him
it
happened
very
quickly
the
rev
james
milligan
lingered
a
moment
by
his
door
to
watch
he
saw
mullins
the
disgusting
mullins
step
blithely
into
the
bathroom
passage
he
saw
him
pause
shrink
back
and
raise
his
arm
to
protect
his
face
he
heard
him
swear
out
aloud
what
the
d
d
thing
doing
here
have
i
really
got
again
and
then
he
heard
him
laugh
a
hearty
guffawing
laugh
of
genuine
relief
it
the
moment
of
revulsion
was
overwhelming
it
filled
the
churchly
heart
with
anguish
and
bitter
disappointment
for
a
space
he
hated
the
whole
race
of
men
for
the
instant
mullins
realised
that
the
insect
was
not
a
fiery
illusion
of
his
disordered
nerves
he
went
forward
without
the
smallest
hesitation
with
his
towel
he
knocked
down
the
flying
terror
then
he
stooped
he
gathered
up
the
venomous
thing
his
blow
had
stricken
so
easily
to
the
floor
he
advanced
with
it
held
at
length
to
the
window
he
tossed
it
out
carelessly
the
egyptian
hornet
flew
away
uninjured
and
mullins
the
mullins
who
drank
gave
nothing
to
the
church
attended
no
services
hated
parsons
and
proclaimed
the
fact
with
enthusiasm
this
same
detestable
mullins
went
to
his
unearned
bath
without
a
scratch
but
first
he
saw
his
enemy
standing
in
the
doorway
across
the
passage
watching
him
and
understood
that
was
the
awful
part
of
it
mullins
would
make
a
story
of
it
and
the
story
would
go
the
round
of
the
hotel
the
rev
james
milligan
however
proved
that
his
reputation
for
was
not
undeserved
he
conducted
morning
service
half
an
hour
later
with
an
expression
of
peace
upon
his
handsome
face
he
conquered
all
outward
sign
of
inward
spiritual
vexation
the
wicked
he
consoled
himself
ever
flourish
like
green
bay
trees
it
was
notorious
that
the
righteous
never
have
any
luck
at
all
that
was
bad
enough
but
what
was
worse
and
the
rev
james
milligan
remembered
for
very
long
was
the
superior
ease
with
which
mullins
had
relegated
both
himself
and
hornet
to
the
same
level
of
comparative
insignificance
mullins
ignored
them
both
which
proved
that
he
felt
himself
superior
infinitely
worse
than
the
sting
of
any
hornet
in
the
world
he
really
superior
x
by
water
the
night
before
young
larsen
left
to
take
up
his
new
appointment
in
egypt
he
went
to
the
clairvoyante
he
neither
believed
nor
disbelieved
he
felt
no
interest
for
he
already
knew
his
past
and
did
not
wish
to
know
his
future
just
to
please
me
jim
the
girl
pleaded
the
woman
is
wonderful
before
i
had
been
five
minutes
with
her
she
told
me
your
initials
so
there
be
something
in
it
she
read
your
thought
he
smiled
indulgently
even
i
can
do
that
but
the
girl
was
in
earnest
he
yielded
and
that
night
at
his
farewell
dinner
he
came
to
give
his
report
of
the
interview
the
result
was
meagre
and
unconvincing
money
was
coming
to
him
he
was
soon
to
make
a
voyage
and
he
would
never
marry
so
you
see
how
silly
it
all
is
he
laughed
for
they
were
to
be
married
when
his
first
promotion
came
he
gave
the
details
however
making
a
little
story
of
it
in
the
way
he
knew
she
loved
but
was
that
all
jim
the
girl
asked
it
looking
rather
hard
into
his
face
are
you
hiding
something
from
me
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
burst
out
laughing
at
her
clever
discernment
there
a
little
more
he
confessed
but
you
take
it
all
so
seriously
i
he
had
to
tell
it
then
of
course
the
woman
had
told
him
a
lot
of
gibberish
about
friendly
and
unfriendly
elements
she
said
water
was
unfriendly
to
me
i
was
to
be
careful
of
water
or
else
i
should
come
to
harm
by
it
water
only
he
hastened
to
add
seeing
that
the
idea
of
shipwreck
was
in
her
mind
drowning
the
girl
asked
quickly
yes
he
admitted
with
reluctance
but
still
laughing
she
did
say
drowning
though
drowning
in
no
ordinary
way
the
girl
face
showed
uneasiness
a
moment
what
does
that
mean
drowning
in
no
ordinary
way
she
asked
a
catch
in
her
breath
but
that
he
could
not
tell
her
because
he
did
not
know
himself
he
gave
therefore
the
exact
words
you
will
drown
but
will
not
know
you
drown
it
was
unwise
of
him
he
wished
afterwards
he
had
invented
a
happier
report
or
had
kept
this
detail
back
i
safe
in
egypt
anyhow
he
laughed
i
shall
be
a
clever
man
if
i
can
find
enough
water
in
the
desert
to
do
me
harm
and
all
the
way
from
trieste
to
alexandria
he
remembered
the
promise
she
had
extracted
that
he
would
never
once
go
on
the
nile
unless
duty
made
it
imperative
for
him
to
do
so
he
kept
that
promise
like
the
literal
faithful
soul
he
was
his
love
was
equal
to
the
somewhat
quixotic
sacrifice
it
occasionally
involved
fresh
water
in
egypt
there
was
practically
none
other
and
in
any
case
the
natrum
works
where
his
duty
lay
had
their
headquarters
some
distance
out
into
the
desert
the
river
with
its
banks
of
welcome
refreshing
verdure
was
not
even
visible
months
passed
quickly
and
the
time
for
leave
came
within
measurable
distance
in
the
long
interval
luck
had
played
the
cards
kindly
for
him
vacancies
had
occurred
early
promotion
seemed
likely
and
his
letters
were
full
of
plans
to
bring
her
out
to
share
a
little
house
of
their
own
his
health
however
had
not
improved
the
dryness
did
not
suit
him
even
in
this
short
period
his
blood
had
thinned
his
nervous
system
deteriorated
and
contrary
to
the
doctor
prophecy
the
waterless
air
had
told
upon
his
sleep
a
damp
climate
liked
him
best
and
once
the
sun
had
touched
him
with
its
fiery
finger
his
letters
made
no
mention
of
this
he
described
the
life
to
her
the
work
the
sport
the
pleasant
people
and
his
chances
of
increased
pay
and
early
marriage
and
a
week
before
he
sailed
he
rode
out
upon
a
final
act
of
duty
to
inspect
the
latest
diggings
his
company
were
making
his
course
lay
some
twenty
miles
into
the
desert
behind
and
towards
the
limestone
hills
of
guebel
haidi
and
he
went
alone
carrying
lunch
and
tea
for
it
was
the
weekly
holiday
of
friday
and
the
men
were
not
at
work
the
accident
was
ordinary
enough
on
his
way
back
in
the
heat
of
early
afternoon
his
pony
stumbled
against
a
boulder
on
the
treacherous
desert
film
threw
him
heavily
broke
the
girth
bolted
before
he
could
seize
the
reins
again
and
left
him
stranded
some
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
home
there
was
a
pain
in
his
knee
that
made
walking
difficult
a
buzzing
in
his
head
that
troubled
sight
and
made
the
landscape
swim
while
worse
than
either
his
provisions
fastened
to
the
saddle
had
vanished
with
the
frightened
pony
into
those
blazing
leagues
of
sand
he
was
alone
in
the
desert
beneath
the
pitiless
afternoon
sun
twelve
miles
of
utterly
exhausting
country
between
him
and
safety
under
normal
conditions
he
could
have
covered
the
distance
in
four
hours
reaching
home
by
dark
but
his
knee
pained
him
so
that
a
mile
an
hour
proved
the
best
he
could
possibly
do
he
reflected
a
few
minutes
the
wisest
course
was
to
sit
down
and
wait
till
the
pony
told
its
obvious
story
to
the
stable
and
help
should
come
and
this
was
what
he
did
for
the
scorching
heat
and
glare
were
dangerous
they
were
terrible
he
was
shaken
and
bewildered
by
his
fall
hungry
and
weak
into
the
bargain
and
an
hour
painful
scrambling
over
the
baked
and
burning
little
gorges
must
have
speedily
caused
complete
prostration
he
sat
down
and
rubbed
his
aching
knee
it
was
quite
a
little
adventure
yet
though
he
knew
the
desert
might
not
be
lightly
trifled
with
he
felt
at
the
moment
nothing
more
than
this
and
the
amusing
description
of
it
he
would
give
in
his
letter
or
intoxicating
thought
by
word
of
mouth
in
the
heat
of
the
sun
he
began
to
feel
drowsy
a
soft
torpor
crept
over
him
he
dozed
he
fell
asleep
it
was
a
long
a
dreamless
sleep
for
when
he
woke
at
length
the
sun
had
just
gone
down
the
dusk
lay
awfully
upon
the
enormous
desert
and
the
air
was
chilly
the
cold
had
waked
him
quickly
as
though
on
purpose
the
red
glow
faded
from
the
sky
the
first
stars
shone
it
was
dark
the
heavens
were
deep
violet
he
looked
round
and
realised
that
his
sense
of
direction
had
gone
entirely
great
hunger
was
in
him
the
cold
already
was
bitter
as
the
wind
rose
but
the
pain
in
his
knee
having
eased
he
got
up
and
walked
a
little
and
in
a
moment
lost
sight
of
the
spot
where
he
had
been
lying
the
shadowy
desert
swallowed
it
ah
he
realised
this
is
not
an
english
field
or
moor
i
in
the
desert
the
safe
thing
to
do
was
to
remain
exactly
where
he
was
only
thus
could
the
rescuers
find
him
once
he
wandered
he
was
done
for
it
was
strange
the
had
not
yet
arrived
to
keep
warm
however
he
was
compelled
to
move
so
he
made
a
little
pile
of
stones
to
mark
the
place
and
walked
round
and
round
it
in
a
circle
of
some
dozen
yards
diameter
he
limped
badly
and
the
hunger
gnawed
dreadfully
but
after
all
the
adventure
was
not
so
terrible
the
amusing
side
of
it
kept
uppermost
still
though
fragile
in
body
his
spirit
was
not
unduly
timid
or
imaginative
he
last
out
the
night
or
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
the
next
day
as
well
but
when
he
watched
the
little
group
of
stones
he
saw
that
there
were
dozens
of
them
scores
hundreds
thousands
of
these
little
groups
of
stones
the
desert
face
of
course
is
thickly
strewn
with
them
the
original
one
was
lost
in
the
first
five
minutes
so
he
sat
down
again
but
the
biting
cold
and
the
wind
that
licked
his
very
skin
beneath
the
light
clothing
soon
forced
him
up
again
it
was
ominous
and
the
night
huge
and
shelterless
the
shaft
of
green
zodiacal
light
that
hung
so
strangely
in
the
western
sky
for
hours
had
faded
away
the
stars
were
out
in
their
bright
thousands
no
guide
was
anywhere
the
wind
moaned
and
puffed
among
the
sandy
mounds
the
vast
sheet
of
desert
stretched
appallingly
upon
the
world
he
heard
the
jackals
cry
and
with
the
jackals
cry
came
suddenly
the
unwelcome
realisation
that
no
play
was
in
this
adventure
any
more
but
that
a
bleak
reality
stared
at
him
through
the
surrounding
darkness
he
faced
it
at
bay
he
was
genuinely
lost
thought
blocked
in
him
i
must
be
calm
and
think
he
said
aloud
his
voice
woke
no
echo
it
was
small
and
dead
something
gigantic
ate
it
instantly
he
got
up
and
walked
again
why
did
no
one
come
hours
had
passed
the
pony
had
long
ago
found
its
stable
or
had
it
run
madly
in
another
direction
altogether
he
worked
out
possibilities
tightening
his
belt
the
cold
was
searching
he
never
had
been
never
could
be
warm
again
the
hot
sunshine
of
a
few
hours
ago
seemed
the
merest
dream
unfamiliar
with
hardship
he
knew
not
what
to
do
but
he
took
his
coat
and
shirt
off
vigorously
rubbed
his
skin
where
the
dried
perspiration
of
the
afternoon
still
caused
clammy
shivers
swung
his
arms
furiously
like
a
london
cabman
and
quickly
dressed
again
though
the
wind
upon
his
bare
back
was
fearful
he
felt
warmer
a
little
he
lay
down
exhausted
sheltered
by
an
overhanging
limestone
crag
and
took
snatches
of
fitful
while
the
wind
drove
overhead
and
the
dry
sand
pricked
his
skin
one
face
continually
was
near
him
one
pair
of
tender
eyes
two
dear
hands
smoothed
him
he
smelt
the
perfume
of
light
brown
hair
it
was
all
natural
enough
his
whole
thought
in
his
misery
ran
to
her
in
england
england
where
there
were
soft
fresh
grass
big
sheltering
trees
hemlock
and
honeysuckle
in
the
hedges
while
the
hard
black
desert
guarded
him
and
consciousness
dipped
away
at
little
intervals
under
this
dry
and
pitiless
egyptian
sky
it
was
perhaps
five
in
the
morning
when
a
voice
spoke
and
he
started
up
with
a
horrid
jerk
the
voice
of
that
clairvoyante
woman
the
sentence
died
away
into
the
darkness
but
one
word
remained
at
first
he
wondered
but
at
once
explanation
came
cause
and
effect
were
obvious
the
clue
was
physical
his
body
needed
water
and
so
the
thought
came
up
into
his
mind
he
was
thirsty
this
was
the
moment
when
fear
first
really
touched
him
hunger
was
manageable
more
or
less
for
a
day
or
two
certainly
but
thirst
thirst
and
the
desert
were
an
evil
pair
that
by
cumulative
suggestion
gathering
since
childhood
days
brought
terror
in
once
in
the
mind
it
could
not
be
dislodged
in
spite
of
his
best
efforts
the
ghastly
thing
grew
passionately
because
his
thirst
grew
too
he
had
smoked
much
had
eaten
spiced
things
at
lunch
had
breathed
in
alkali
with
the
dry
scorched
air
he
searched
for
a
cool
flint
pebble
to
put
into
his
burning
mouth
but
found
only
angular
scraps
of
dusty
limestone
there
were
no
pebbles
here
the
cold
helped
a
little
to
counteract
but
already
he
knew
in
himself
subconsciously
the
dread
of
something
that
was
coming
what
was
it
he
tried
to
hide
the
thought
and
bury
it
out
of
sight
the
utter
futility
of
his
tiny
strength
against
the
power
of
the
universe
appalled
him
and
then
he
knew
the
merciless
sun
was
on
the
way
already
rising
its
return
was
like
the
presage
of
execution
to
him
it
came
with
true
horror
he
watched
the
marvellous
swift
dawn
break
over
the
sandy
sea
the
eastern
sky
glowed
hurriedly
as
from
crimson
fires
ridges
not
noticeable
in
the
starlight
turned
black
in
endless
series
like
billows
of
a
frozen
ocean
wide
streaks
of
blue
and
yellow
followed
as
the
sky
dropped
sheets
of
faint
light
upon
the
cliffs
and
showed
their
under
sides
they
did
not
advance
they
waited
till
the
sun
was
up
and
then
they
moved
they
rose
and
sank
they
shifted
as
the
sunshine
lifted
them
and
the
shadows
crept
away
but
in
an
hour
there
would
be
no
shadows
any
more
there
would
be
no
shade
the
little
groups
of
stones
began
to
dance
it
was
horrible
the
unbroken
huge
expanse
lay
round
him
warming
up
twelve
hours
of
blazing
hell
to
come
already
the
monstrous
desert
glared
each
bit
familiar
since
each
bit
was
a
repetition
of
the
bit
before
behind
on
either
side
it
laughed
at
guidance
and
direction
he
rose
and
walked
for
miles
he
walked
though
how
many
north
south
or
west
he
knew
not
the
frantic
thing
was
in
him
now
the
fury
of
the
desert
he
took
its
pace
its
endless
tireless
stride
the
stride
of
the
burning
murderous
desert
that
is
waterless
he
felt
it
alive
a
blindly
heaving
desire
in
it
to
reduce
him
to
its
conditionless
awful
dryness
he
felt
yet
knowing
this
was
feverish
and
to
be
believed
that
his
own
small
life
lay
on
its
mighty
surface
a
mere
dot
in
space
a
mere
heap
of
little
stones
his
emotions
his
fears
his
hopes
his
ambition
his
love
mere
bundled
group
of
little
unimportant
stones
that
danced
with
apparent
activity
for
a
moment
then
were
merged
in
the
undifferentiated
surface
underneath
he
was
included
in
a
purpose
greater
than
his
own
the
will
made
a
plucky
effort
then
a
night
and
a
day
he
laughed
while
his
lips
cracked
smartingly
with
the
stretching
of
the
skin
what
is
it
many
a
chap
has
lasted
days
and
days
yes
only
he
was
not
of
that
rare
company
he
was
ordinary
unaccustomed
to
privation
weak
untrained
of
spirit
unacquainted
with
stern
resistance
he
knew
not
how
to
spare
himself
the
desert
struck
him
where
it
pleased
all
over
it
played
with
him
his
tongue
was
swollen
the
parched
throat
could
not
swallow
he
sank
an
hour
he
lay
there
just
wit
enough
in
him
to
choose
the
top
of
a
mound
where
he
could
be
most
easily
seen
he
lay
two
hours
three
four
hours
the
heat
blazed
down
upon
him
like
a
furnace
the
sky
when
he
opened
his
eyes
once
was
empty
then
a
speck
became
visible
in
the
blue
expanse
and
presently
another
speck
they
came
from
nowhere
they
hovered
very
high
almost
out
of
sight
they
appeared
they
disappeared
they
reappeared
nearer
and
nearer
they
swung
down
in
sweeping
stealthy
circles
little
dancing
groups
of
them
miles
away
but
ever
drawing
closer
the
vultures
he
had
strained
his
ears
so
long
for
sounds
of
feet
and
voices
that
it
seemed
he
could
no
longer
hear
at
all
hearing
had
ceased
within
him
then
came
the
with
their
agonising
torture
he
heard
heard
it
running
in
silvery
streams
and
rivulets
across
green
english
meadows
it
rippled
with
silvery
music
he
heard
it
splash
he
dipped
hands
and
feet
and
head
in
it
in
deep
clear
pools
of
generous
depth
he
drank
with
his
skin
he
drank
not
with
mouth
and
throat
alone
ice
clinked
in
effervescent
sparkling
water
against
a
glass
he
swam
and
plunged
water
gushed
freely
over
back
and
shoulders
gallons
and
gallons
of
it
bathfuls
and
to
spare
a
flood
of
gushing
crystal
cool
liquid
and
then
he
stood
in
a
beech
wood
and
felt
the
streaming
deluge
of
delicious
summer
rain
upon
his
face
heard
it
drip
luxuriantly
upon
a
million
thirsty
leaves
the
wet
trunks
shone
the
damp
moss
spread
its
perfume
ferns
waved
heavily
in
the
moist
atmosphere
he
was
soaked
to
the
skin
in
it
a
mountain
torrent
fresh
from
fields
of
snow
foamed
boiling
past
and
the
spray
fell
in
a
shower
upon
his
cheeks
and
hair
he
dived
head
foremost
ah
he
was
up
to
the
neck
and
was
with
him
they
were
under
water
together
he
saw
her
eyes
gleaming
into
his
own
beneath
the
copious
flood
the
voice
however
was
not
hers
you
will
drown
yet
you
will
not
know
you
drown
his
swollen
tongue
called
out
a
name
but
no
sound
was
audible
he
closed
his
eyes
there
came
sweet
unconsciousness
a
sound
in
that
instant
audible
though
it
was
a
voice
voices
and
the
thud
of
animal
hoofs
upon
the
sand
the
specks
had
vanished
from
the
sky
as
mysteriously
as
they
came
and
as
though
in
answer
to
the
sound
he
made
a
movement
an
automatic
unconscious
movement
he
did
not
know
he
moved
and
the
body
uncontrolled
lost
its
precarious
balance
he
rolled
but
he
did
not
know
he
rolled
slowly
over
the
edge
of
the
sloping
mound
of
sand
he
turned
sideways
like
a
log
of
wood
he
slid
gradually
turning
over
and
over
nothing
to
stop
him
to
the
bottom
a
few
feet
only
and
not
even
steep
just
steep
enough
to
keep
rolling
slowly
there
was
a
splash
but
he
did
not
know
there
was
a
splash
they
found
him
in
a
pool
of
water
one
of
these
rare
pools
the
desert
bedouin
mark
preciously
for
their
own
he
had
lain
within
three
yards
of
it
for
hours
he
was
drowned
but
he
did
not
know
he
drowned
xi
in
the
mountain
club
hut
to
which
he
had
escaped
after
weeks
of
gaiety
in
the
capital
delane
young
travelling
englishman
sat
alone
and
listened
to
the
wind
that
beat
the
pines
with
violence
the
firelight
danced
over
the
bare
stone
floor
and
raftered
ceiling
giving
the
room
an
air
of
movement
and
though
the
solid
walls
held
steady
against
the
wild
spring
hurricane
the
cannonading
of
the
wind
seemed
to
threaten
the
foundations
for
the
mountain
shook
the
forest
roared
and
the
shadows
had
a
way
of
running
everywhere
as
though
the
little
building
trembled
delane
watched
and
listened
he
piled
the
logs
on
from
time
to
time
he
glanced
nervously
over
his
shoulder
restless
half
uneasy
as
a
burst
of
spray
from
the
branches
dashed
against
the
window
or
a
gust
of
unusual
vehemence
shook
the
door
with
his
long
day
climb
among
impossible
conditions
he
now
realised
in
this
mountain
refuge
his
utter
loneliness
for
his
mind
gave
birth
to
that
unwelcome
symptom
of
true
loneliness
that
he
was
not
after
all
alone
continually
he
heard
steps
and
voices
in
the
storm
another
wanderer
another
climber
out
of
season
like
himself
would
presently
arrive
and
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
until
first
he
heard
that
knocking
on
the
door
almost
he
expected
some
one
he
went
for
the
tenth
time
to
the
little
window
he
peered
forth
into
the
thick
darkness
of
the
dropping
night
shading
his
eyes
against
the
streaming
pane
to
screen
the
firelight
in
an
attempt
to
see
if
another
climber
perhaps
a
climber
in
distress
were
visible
the
surroundings
were
desolate
and
savage
well
named
the
devil
saddle
precipices
streaked
with
melting
snow
rose
towering
to
the
north
where
the
heights
were
hidden
in
seas
of
vapour
waterfalls
poured
into
abysses
on
two
sides
a
wall
of
impenetrable
forest
pressed
up
from
the
south
and
the
dangerous
ridge
he
had
climbed
all
day
slid
off
wickedly
into
a
sky
of
surging
cloud
but
no
human
figure
was
of
course
distinguishable
for
both
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
elemental
fury
of
the
night
rendered
it
most
unlikely
he
turned
away
with
a
start
as
the
tempest
delivered
a
blow
with
massive
impact
against
his
very
face
then
clearing
the
remnants
of
his
frugal
supper
from
the
table
he
hung
his
soaking
clothes
at
a
new
angle
before
the
fire
made
sure
the
door
was
fastened
on
the
inside
climbed
into
the
bunk
where
white
pillows
and
thick
austrian
blankets
looked
so
inviting
and
prepared
finally
for
sleep
i
must
be
he
sighed
after
half
an
hour
weary
tossing
and
went
back
to
make
up
the
sinking
fire
wood
is
plentiful
in
these
climbers
huts
he
heaped
it
on
but
this
time
he
lit
the
little
oil
lamp
as
well
realising
though
unwilling
to
acknowledge
it
that
it
was
not
that
banished
sleep
but
this
unwelcome
sense
of
expecting
some
one
of
being
not
quite
alone
for
the
feeling
persisted
and
increased
he
drew
the
wooden
bench
close
up
to
the
fire
turned
the
lamp
as
high
as
it
would
go
and
wished
unaccountably
for
the
morning
light
was
a
very
pleasant
thing
and
darkness
now
for
the
first
time
since
childhood
troubled
him
it
was
outside
but
it
might
so
easily
come
in
and
swamp
obliterate
extinguish
the
darkness
seemed
a
positive
thing
already
somehow
it
was
established
in
his
mind
this
sense
of
enormous
aggressive
darkness
that
veiled
an
undesirable
hint
of
personality
some
shadow
from
the
peaks
or
from
the
forest
immense
and
threatening
pervaded
all
his
thought
this
ca
be
entirely
nerves
he
whispered
to
himself
i
not
so
tired
as
all
that
and
he
made
the
fire
roar
he
shivered
and
drew
closer
to
the
blaze
i
out
of
condition
that
part
of
it
he
realised
and
remembered
with
loathing
the
weeks
of
luxurious
indulgence
just
behind
him
for
delane
had
rather
wasted
his
year
of
educational
travel
straight
from
oxford
and
well
supplied
with
money
he
had
first
saturated
his
mind
in
the
latest
continental
thought
the
science
of
france
the
metaphysics
and
philosophy
of
germany
and
had
then
been
caught
aside
by
the
gaiety
of
capitals
where
the
lights
are
not
turned
out
at
midnight
by
a
sunday
school
police
he
had
been
surfeited
physically
emotionally
and
intellectually
till
his
mind
and
body
longed
hungrily
for
simple
living
again
and
simple
teaching
above
all
the
latter
the
road
of
excess
leads
to
the
palace
of
wisdom
for
certain
temperaments
as
blake
forgot
to
add
of
which
delane
was
one
for
there
was
stuff
in
the
youth
and
the
reaction
had
set
in
with
violent
abruptness
his
system
rebelled
he
cut
loose
energetically
from
all
soft
delights
and
craved
for
severity
pure
air
solitude
and
hardship
clean
and
simple
conditions
he
must
have
without
delay
and
the
tonic
of
physical
battling
it
was
too
early
in
the
year
to
climb
seriously
for
the
snow
was
still
dangerous
and
the
weather
wild
but
he
had
chosen
this
most
isolated
of
all
the
mountain
huts
in
order
to
make
sure
of
solitude
and
had
come
without
guide
or
companion
for
a
week
strenuous
life
in
wild
surroundings
and
to
take
stock
of
himself
with
a
view
to
full
recovery
and
all
day
long
as
he
climbed
the
desolate
unsafe
ridge
his
mind
good
wholesome
natural
symptom
had
reverted
to
his
childhood
days
to
the
solid
worldly
wisdom
of
his
father
and
to
the
early
teaching
oh
how
sweet
and
refreshing
in
its
literal
spirit
at
his
mother
knee
now
as
he
watched
the
blazing
logs
it
came
back
to
him
again
with
redoubled
force
the
simple
precious
stories
of
heaven
and
hell
of
a
paternal
deity
and
of
a
daring
subtle
personal
devil
the
interruption
to
his
thoughts
came
with
startling
suddenness
as
the
roaring
night
descended
against
the
windows
with
a
thundering
violence
that
shook
the
walls
and
sucked
the
flame
up
the
wide
stone
chimney
the
oil
lamp
flickered
and
went
out
darkness
invaded
the
room
for
a
second
and
delane
sprang
from
his
bench
thinking
the
wet
snow
had
loosened
far
above
and
was
about
to
sweep
the
hut
into
the
depths
and
he
was
still
standing
trembling
and
uncertain
in
the
middle
of
the
room
when
a
deep
and
sighing
hush
followed
sharp
upon
the
elemental
outburst
and
in
the
hush
like
a
whisper
after
thunder
he
heard
a
curious
steady
sound
that
at
first
he
thought
must
be
a
footstep
by
the
door
it
was
then
instantly
repeated
but
it
was
not
a
step
it
was
some
one
knocking
on
the
heavy
oaken
panels
a
firm
authoritative
sound
as
though
the
new
arrival
had
the
right
to
enter
and
was
already
impatient
at
the
delay
the
englishman
recovered
himself
instantly
realising
with
keen
relief
the
new
arrival
at
last
another
climber
like
myself
of
course
he
said
or
perhaps
the
man
who
comes
to
prepare
the
hut
for
others
the
season
has
begun
and
he
went
over
quickly
without
a
further
qualm
to
unbolt
the
door
forgive
he
exclaimed
in
german
as
he
threw
it
wide
i
was
half
asleep
before
the
fire
it
is
a
terrible
night
come
in
to
food
and
shelter
for
both
are
here
and
you
shall
share
such
supper
as
i
possess
and
a
tall
cloaked
figure
passed
him
swiftly
with
a
gust
of
angry
wind
from
the
impenetrable
blackness
of
the
world
beyond
on
the
threshold
for
a
second
his
outline
stood
full
in
the
blaze
of
firelight
with
the
sheet
of
darkness
behind
it
stately
erect
commanding
his
cloak
torn
fiercely
by
the
wind
but
the
face
hidden
by
a
hat
and
an
instant
later
the
door
shut
with
resounding
clamour
upon
the
hurricane
and
the
two
men
turned
to
confront
one
another
in
the
little
room
delane
then
realised
two
things
sharply
both
of
them
fleeting
impressions
but
acutely
vivid
first
that
the
outside
darkness
seemed
to
have
entered
and
established
itself
between
him
and
the
new
arrival
and
secondly
that
the
stranger
face
was
difficult
to
focus
for
clear
sight
although
the
covering
hat
was
now
removed
there
was
a
blur
upon
it
somewhere
and
this
the
englishman
ascribed
partly
to
the
flickering
effect
of
firelight
and
partly
to
the
lightning
glare
of
the
man
masterful
and
terrific
eyes
which
made
his
own
sight
waver
in
some
curious
fashion
as
he
gazed
upon
him
these
impressions
however
were
but
momentary
and
passing
due
doubtless
to
the
condition
of
his
nerves
and
to
the
of
the
dramatic
even
theatrical
entrance
delane
senses
in
this
wild
setting
were
guilty
of
exaggeration
for
now
while
helping
the
man
remove
his
cloak
speaking
naturally
of
shelter
food
and
the
savage
weather
he
lost
this
first
distortion
and
his
mind
recovered
sane
proportion
the
stranger
after
all
though
striking
was
not
of
appearance
so
uncommon
as
to
cause
alarm
the
light
and
the
low
doorway
had
touched
his
stature
with
illusion
he
dwindled
and
the
great
eyes
upon
calmer
subsequent
inspection
lost
their
original
fierce
lightning
the
entering
darkness
moreover
was
but
an
effect
of
the
upheaving
night
behind
him
as
he
strode
across
the
threshold
the
closed
door
proved
it
and
yet
as
delane
continued
his
quieter
examination
there
remained
he
saw
the
startling
quality
which
had
caused
that
first
magnifying
in
his
mind
his
senses
while
reporting
accurately
insisted
upon
this
arresting
and
uncommon
touch
there
was
about
this
late
wanderer
of
the
night
some
evasive
lofty
strangeness
that
set
him
utterly
apart
from
ordinary
men
the
englishman
examined
him
searchingly
surreptitiously
but
with
a
touch
of
passionate
curiosity
he
could
not
in
the
least
account
for
nor
explain
there
were
contradictions
of
perplexing
character
about
him
for
the
first
presentment
had
been
of
splendid
youth
while
on
the
face
though
vigorous
and
gloriously
handsome
he
now
discerned
the
stamp
of
tremendous
age
it
was
worn
and
tired
while
radiant
with
strength
and
health
and
power
it
wore
as
well
this
certain
signature
of
deep
exhaustion
that
great
experience
rather
than
physical
experience
brings
moreover
he
discovered
in
it
in
some
way
he
could
not
hope
to
describe
man
woman
and
child
there
was
a
big
sad
earnestness
about
it
yet
a
touch
of
humour
too
patience
tenderness
and
sweetness
held
the
mouth
and
behind
the
high
pale
forehead
intellect
sat
enthroned
and
watchful
in
it
were
both
love
and
hatred
longing
and
despair
an
expression
of
being
ever
on
the
defensive
yet
hugely
mutinous
an
air
both
hunted
and
beseeching
great
knowledge
and
great
woe
delane
gave
up
the
search
aware
that
something
unalterably
splendid
stood
before
him
solemnity
and
beauty
swept
him
too
his
was
never
the
grotesque
assumption
that
man
must
be
the
highest
being
in
the
universe
nor
that
a
thing
is
a
miracle
merely
because
it
has
never
happened
before
he
groped
while
explanation
and
analysis
both
halted
a
great
teacher
thought
fluttered
through
him
or
a
mighty
rebel
a
distinguished
personality
beyond
all
question
who
can
he
be
there
was
something
regal
that
put
respect
upon
his
imagination
instantly
and
he
remembered
the
legend
of
the
that
ludwig
of
bavaria
was
said
to
be
about
when
nights
were
very
wild
he
wondered
into
his
speech
and
manner
crept
unawares
an
attitude
of
deference
that
was
almost
reverence
and
with
it
whence
came
this
other
quality
a
searching
pity
you
must
be
wearied
out
he
said
respectfully
busying
himself
about
the
room
as
well
as
cold
and
wet
this
fire
will
dry
you
sir
and
meanwhile
i
will
prepare
quickly
such
food
as
there
is
if
you
will
eat
it
for
the
other
carried
no
knapsack
nor
was
he
clothed
for
the
severity
of
mountain
travel
i
have
already
eaten
said
the
stranger
courteously
and
with
my
thanks
to
you
i
am
neither
wet
nor
tired
the
afflictions
that
i
bear
are
of
another
kind
though
ones
that
you
shall
more
easily
i
am
sure
relieve
he
spoke
as
a
man
whose
words
set
troops
in
action
and
delane
glanced
at
him
deeply
moved
by
the
surprising
phrase
yet
hardly
marvelling
that
it
should
be
so
he
found
no
ready
answer
but
there
was
evidently
question
in
his
look
for
the
other
continued
and
this
time
with
a
smile
that
betrayed
sheer
winning
beauty
as
of
a
tender
woman
i
saw
the
light
and
came
to
it
it
is
unusual
at
this
time
his
voice
was
resonant
yet
not
deep
there
was
a
ringing
quality
about
it
that
the
bare
room
emphasised
it
charmed
the
young
englishman
inexplicably
also
it
woke
in
him
a
sense
of
infinite
pathos
you
are
a
climber
sir
like
myself
delane
resumed
lifting
his
eyes
a
moment
uneasily
from
the
coffee
he
brewed
over
a
corner
of
the
fire
you
know
this
neighbourhood
perhaps
better
at
any
rate
than
i
can
know
it
his
german
halted
rather
he
chose
his
words
with
difficulty
there
was
uncommon
trouble
in
his
mind
i
know
all
wild
and
desolate
places
replied
the
other
in
perfect
english
but
with
a
wintry
mournfulness
in
his
voice
and
eyes
for
i
feel
at
home
in
them
and
their
stern
companionship
my
nature
craves
as
solace
but
unlike
yourself
i
am
no
climber
the
heights
have
no
attraction
for
you
asked
delane
as
he
mingled
steaming
milk
and
coffee
in
the
wooden
bowl
marvelling
what
brought
him
then
so
high
above
the
valleys
it
is
their
difficulty
and
danger
that
fascinate
me
always
i
find
the
loneliness
of
the
summits
intoxicating
in
a
sense
and
regardless
of
refusal
he
set
the
bread
and
meat
before
him
the
apple
and
the
tiny
packet
of
salt
then
turned
away
to
place
the
coffee
pot
beside
the
fire
again
but
as
he
did
so
a
singular
gesture
of
the
other
caught
his
eyes
before
touching
bowl
or
plate
the
stranger
took
the
fruit
and
brushed
his
lips
with
it
he
kissed
it
then
set
it
on
the
ground
and
crushed
it
into
pulp
beneath
his
heel
and
seeing
this
the
young
englishman
knew
something
dreadfully
arrested
in
his
mind
for
as
he
looked
away
pretending
the
act
was
unobserved
a
thing
of
ice
and
darkness
moved
past
him
through
the
room
so
that
the
pot
trembled
in
his
hand
rattling
sharply
against
the
hearthstone
where
he
stooped
he
could
only
interpret
it
as
an
act
of
madness
and
the
myth
of
the
sad
drowned
monarch
wandering
through
this
enchanted
region
pressed
into
him
again
unsought
and
urgent
it
was
a
full
minute
before
he
had
control
of
his
heart
and
hand
again
the
bowl
was
half
emptied
and
the
man
was
smiling
this
time
the
smile
of
a
child
who
implores
the
comfort
of
enveloping
and
understanding
arms
i
am
a
wanderer
rather
than
a
climber
he
was
saying
as
though
there
had
been
no
interval
for
though
the
lonely
summits
suit
me
well
i
now
find
in
them
only
terror
my
feet
lose
their
sureness
and
my
head
its
steady
balance
i
prefer
the
hidden
gorges
of
these
mountains
and
the
shadows
of
the
covering
forests
my
days
his
voice
drew
the
loneliness
of
uttermost
space
into
its
piteous
accents
are
passed
in
darkness
i
can
never
climb
again
he
spoke
this
time
indeed
as
a
man
whose
nerve
was
gone
for
ever
it
was
pitiable
almost
to
tears
and
delane
unable
to
explain
the
amazing
contradictions
felt
recklessly
furiously
drawn
to
this
trapped
wanderer
with
the
mien
of
a
king
yet
the
air
and
speech
sometimes
of
a
woman
and
sometimes
of
an
outcast
child
ah
then
you
have
known
accidents
delane
replied
with
outer
calmness
as
he
lit
his
pipe
trying
in
vain
to
keep
his
hand
as
steady
as
his
voice
you
have
been
in
one
perhaps
the
effect
i
have
been
told
is
the
power
and
sweetness
in
that
resonant
voice
took
his
breath
away
as
he
heard
it
break
in
upon
his
own
uncertain
accents
i
have
fallen
the
stranger
replied
impressively
as
the
rain
and
wind
wailed
past
the
building
mournfully
yet
a
fall
that
was
no
part
of
any
accident
for
it
was
no
common
fall
the
man
added
with
a
magnificent
gesture
of
disdain
while
yet
it
broke
my
heart
in
two
he
stooped
a
little
as
he
uttered
the
next
words
with
a
crying
pathos
that
an
outcast
woman
might
have
used
i
am
he
said
engulfed
in
intolerable
loneliness
i
can
never
climb
again
with
a
shiver
impossible
to
control
half
of
terror
half
of
pity
delane
moved
a
step
nearer
to
the
marvellous
stranger
the
spirit
of
ludwig
exiled
and
distraught
had
gripped
his
soul
with
a
weakening
terror
but
now
sheer
beauty
lifted
him
above
all
personal
shrinking
there
seemed
some
echo
of
lost
divinity
worn
wild
yet
grandiose
through
which
this
significant
language
strained
towards
a
personal
message
for
himself
in
loneliness
he
faltered
sympathy
rising
in
a
flood
for
my
kingdom
that
is
lost
to
me
for
ever
met
him
in
deep
throbbing
tones
that
set
the
air
on
fire
for
my
imperial
ancient
heights
that
jealousy
took
from
me
the
stranger
paused
with
an
indescribable
air
of
broken
dignity
and
pain
outside
the
tempest
paused
a
moment
before
the
awful
elemental
crash
that
followed
a
bellowing
of
many
winds
descended
like
artillery
upon
the
world
a
burst
of
smoke
rushed
from
the
fireplace
about
them
both
shrouding
the
stranger
momentarily
in
a
flying
veil
and
delane
stood
up
uncomfortable
in
his
very
bones
what
can
it
be
he
asked
himself
sharply
who
is
this
being
that
he
should
use
such
language
he
watched
alarm
chase
pity
aware
that
the
conversation
held
something
beyond
experience
but
the
pity
returned
in
greater
and
ever
greater
flood
and
love
surged
through
him
too
it
was
significant
he
remembered
afterwards
that
he
felt
it
incumbent
upon
himself
to
stand
curious
too
how
the
thought
of
that
mad
drowned
monarch
haunted
memory
with
such
persistence
some
vast
emotion
that
he
could
not
name
drove
out
his
subsequent
words
the
smoke
had
cleared
and
a
strange
high
stillness
held
the
world
the
rain
streamed
down
in
torrents
isolating
these
two
somehow
from
the
haunts
of
men
and
the
englishman
stared
then
into
a
countenance
grown
mighty
with
woe
and
loneliness
there
stood
darkly
in
it
this
incommunicable
magnificence
of
pain
that
mingled
awe
with
the
pity
he
had
felt
the
kingly
eyes
looked
clear
into
his
own
completing
his
subjugation
out
of
time
i
would
follow
you
ran
his
thought
upon
its
knees
follow
you
with
obedience
for
ever
and
ever
even
into
a
last
damnation
for
you
are
sublime
you
shall
come
again
into
your
kingdom
if
my
own
small
worship
then
blackness
sponged
the
reckless
thought
away
he
spoke
in
its
place
a
more
guarded
careful
thing
i
am
aware
he
faltered
yet
conscious
that
he
bowed
of
standing
before
a
great
one
of
some
world
unknown
to
me
who
he
may
be
i
have
but
the
privilege
of
wondering
he
has
spoken
darkly
of
a
kingdom
that
is
lost
yet
he
is
still
i
see
a
monarch
and
he
lowered
his
head
and
shoulders
involuntarily
for
an
instant
then
as
he
said
it
the
eyes
before
him
flashed
their
original
terrific
lightnings
the
darkness
of
the
common
world
faded
before
the
entrance
of
an
outer
darkness
from
gulfs
of
terror
at
his
feet
rose
shadows
out
of
the
night
of
time
and
a
passionate
anguish
as
of
sudden
madness
seized
his
heart
and
shook
it
he
listened
breathlessly
for
the
words
that
followed
it
seemed
some
wind
of
unutterable
despair
passed
in
the
breath
from
those
lips
i
am
still
a
monarch
yes
but
my
kingdom
is
taken
from
me
for
i
have
no
single
subject
lost
in
a
loneliness
that
lies
out
of
space
and
time
i
am
become
a
throneless
ruler
and
my
hopelessness
is
more
than
i
can
bear
the
beseeching
pathos
of
the
voice
tore
him
in
two
the
deity
himself
it
seemed
stood
there
accused
of
jealousy
of
sin
and
cruelty
the
stranger
rose
the
power
about
him
brought
the
picture
of
a
planet
throned
in
and
poised
beyond
assault
not
otherwise
boomed
the
startling
words
as
though
an
avalanche
found
syllables
could
i
now
show
myself
to
you
delane
was
trembling
horribly
he
felt
the
next
words
slip
off
his
tongue
unconsciously
the
shattering
truth
had
dawned
upon
his
soul
at
last
then
the
light
you
saw
and
came
to
he
whispered
was
the
light
in
your
heart
that
guided
me
came
the
answer
sweet
beguiling
as
the
music
in
a
woman
tones
the
light
of
your
instant
brief
desire
that
held
love
in
it
he
made
an
opening
movement
with
his
arms
as
he
continued
smiling
like
stars
in
summer
for
you
summoned
me
summoned
me
by
your
dear
and
precious
belief
how
dear
how
precious
none
can
know
but
i
who
stand
before
you
his
figure
drew
up
with
an
imperial
air
of
proud
dominion
his
feet
were
set
among
the
constellations
the
opening
movement
of
his
arms
continued
slowly
and
the
music
in
his
tones
seemed
merged
in
distant
thunder
for
your
single
brief
belief
he
smiled
with
the
grandeur
of
a
condescending
emperor
shall
give
my
vanished
kingdom
back
to
me
and
with
an
air
of
native
majesty
he
held
his
hand
out
to
be
kissed
the
black
hurricane
of
night
the
terror
of
frozen
peaks
the
yawning
horror
of
the
great
abyss
outside
all
three
crowded
into
the
englishman
mind
with
a
slashing
impact
that
blocked
delivery
of
any
word
or
action
it
was
not
that
he
refused
it
was
not
that
he
withdrew
but
that
life
stood
paralysed
and
rigid
the
flow
stopped
dead
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
left
his
mother
womb
the
god
in
him
was
turned
to
stone
and
rendered
ineffective
for
an
appalling
instant
god
was
he
realised
the
stupendous
moment
before
him
drinking
his
little
soul
out
merely
by
his
presence
stood
one
whose
habit
of
mind
not
alone
his
external
accidents
was
imperial
with
black
prerogative
before
the
first
man
drew
the
breath
of
life
august
procedure
was
native
to
his
inner
process
of
existence
the
stars
and
confines
of
the
universe
owned
his
sway
before
he
fell
to
trifle
away
the
dreary
little
centuries
by
haunting
the
minds
of
feeble
men
and
women
by
hiding
himself
in
nursery
cupboards
and
by
grinning
with
stained
gargoyles
from
the
roofs
of
city
churches
and
the
lad
life
stammered
flickered
threatened
to
go
out
before
the
enveloping
terror
of
the
revelation
i
called
to
you
but
called
to
you
in
play
thought
whispered
somewhere
deep
below
the
level
of
any
speech
yet
not
so
low
that
the
audacious
sound
of
it
did
not
crash
above
the
elements
outside
for
till
now
you
have
been
to
me
but
a
coated
bogy
that
my
brain
disowned
with
laughter
and
my
heart
thought
picturesque
if
you
are
here
may
god
forgive
me
for
my
it
seemed
as
though
tears
the
tears
of
love
and
profound
commiseration
drowned
the
very
seed
of
thought
itself
a
sound
stopped
him
that
was
like
a
collapse
in
heaven
some
crashing
as
of
a
ruined
world
passed
splintering
through
his
little
timid
heart
he
did
not
yield
but
he
understood
with
an
understanding
which
seemed
the
delicate
first
sign
of
yielding
the
seductiveness
of
evil
the
sweet
delight
of
surrendering
the
will
with
utter
recklessness
to
those
swelling
forces
which
disintegrate
the
heroic
soul
in
man
he
remembered
it
was
true
in
the
reaction
from
excess
he
definitely
called
upon
his
childhood
teaching
with
a
passing
moment
of
genuine
belief
and
now
that
yearning
of
a
fraction
of
a
second
bore
its
awful
fruit
the
luscious
capitals
where
he
had
rioted
passed
in
a
coloured
stream
before
his
eyes
the
wine
the
woman
and
the
song
stood
there
before
him
clothed
in
that
power
which
lies
insinuatingly
disguised
behind
their
little
passing
show
of
innocence
their
glamour
donned
this
domino
of
regal
and
virile
grandeur
he
felt
entangled
beyond
recovery
the
idea
of
god
seemed
sterile
and
without
reality
the
one
real
thing
the
one
desirable
thing
the
one
possible
strong
and
beautiful
thing
was
to
bend
his
head
and
kiss
those
imperial
fingers
he
moved
noiselessly
towards
the
hand
he
raised
his
own
to
take
it
and
lift
it
towards
his
mouth
when
there
rose
in
his
mind
with
startling
vividness
a
small
soft
picture
of
a
child
nursery
a
picture
of
a
little
boy
kneeling
in
scanty
with
pink
upturned
soles
and
asking
ridiculous
audacious
things
of
a
shining
figure
seated
on
a
summer
cloud
above
the
walnut
tree
the
tiny
symbol
flashed
and
went
its
way
yet
not
before
it
had
lit
the
entire
world
with
glory
for
there
came
an
absolutely
routing
power
with
it
in
that
instant
craving
for
the
simple
teaching
of
his
childhood
days
belief
had
conjured
with
two
immense
traditions
this
was
the
second
of
them
the
appearance
of
the
one
had
inevitably
produced
the
passage
of
its
opposite
and
the
hand
that
floated
in
the
air
before
him
to
be
kissed
sank
slowly
down
below
the
possible
level
of
his
lips
he
shrank
away
though
laughter
tempted
something
in
his
brain
there
still
clung
about
his
heart
the
first
aching
pitying
terror
but
size
retreated
dwindling
somehow
as
it
went
the
wind
and
rain
obliterated
every
other
sound
yet
in
that
bare
unfurnished
room
of
a
climber
mountain
hut
there
was
a
silence
above
the
roar
that
drank
in
everything
and
broke
the
back
of
speech
in
opposition
to
this
masquerading
splendour
delane
had
set
up
a
personal
paternal
deity
i
thought
of
you
perhaps
cried
the
voice
of
but
i
did
not
call
to
you
with
real
belief
and
by
the
name
of
god
i
did
not
summon
you
for
your
sweetness
as
your
power
sickens
me
and
your
hand
is
black
with
the
curses
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
world
whose
prayers
and
tears
he
stopped
dead
overwhelmed
by
the
cruelty
of
his
reckless
utterance
and
the
other
moved
towards
him
slowly
it
was
like
the
summit
of
some
peaked
and
terrible
height
that
moved
he
spoke
he
changed
appallingly
but
claim
he
roared
your
heart
i
claim
you
by
that
instant
of
belief
you
felt
for
by
that
alone
you
shall
restore
to
me
my
vanished
kingdom
you
shall
worship
me
in
the
countenance
was
a
sudden
awful
power
but
behind
the
stupefying
roar
there
was
weakness
in
the
voice
as
of
an
imploring
and
beseeching
child
again
deep
love
and
searching
pity
seared
the
heart
as
he
replied
in
the
gentlest
accents
he
could
find
to
master
and
i
claim
he
said
by
my
understanding
sympathy
and
by
my
sorrow
for
your
loneliness
and
by
my
love
for
no
kingdom
built
on
hate
can
stand
against
the
love
you
would
deny
words
failed
him
then
as
he
saw
the
majesty
fade
slowly
from
the
face
grown
small
and
shadowy
one
last
expression
of
desperate
energy
in
the
eyes
struck
lightnings
from
the
smoky
air
as
with
an
abandoned
movement
of
the
entire
figure
he
drew
back
it
seemed
towards
the
door
behind
him
delane
moved
slowly
after
him
opening
his
arms
tenderness
and
big
compassion
flung
wide
the
gates
of
love
within
him
he
found
strange
language
too
although
actual
spoken
words
did
not
produce
them
further
than
his
entrails
where
they
had
their
birth
toys
in
the
world
are
plentiful
sire
and
you
may
have
them
for
your
masterpiece
of
play
but
you
must
seek
them
where
they
still
survive
in
the
churches
and
in
isolated
lands
where
thought
lies
unawakened
for
they
are
the
children
blocks
of
whose
palaces
like
your
once
tremendous
kingdom
have
no
true
existence
for
the
thinking
mind
and
he
stretched
his
hands
towards
him
with
the
gesture
of
one
who
sought
to
help
and
save
then
paused
as
he
realised
that
his
arms
enclosed
sheer
blackness
with
the
emptiness
of
wind
and
driving
rain
for
the
door
of
the
hut
stood
open
and
delane
balanced
on
the
threshold
facing
the
sheet
of
night
above
the
abyss
he
heard
the
waterfalls
in
the
valley
far
below
the
forest
flapped
and
tossed
its
myriad
branches
cold
draughts
swept
down
from
spectral
fields
of
melting
snow
above
and
the
blackness
turned
momentarily
into
the
semblance
of
towers
and
bastions
of
thick
beaten
gloom
above
one
soaring
turret
then
a
space
of
sky
appeared
swept
naked
by
a
violent
lost
wind
an
opening
of
purple
into
limitless
distance
for
one
second
amid
the
vapours
it
was
visible
empty
and
untenanted
the
next
there
sailed
across
its
small
diameter
a
falling
star
with
an
air
of
slow
and
endless
leisure
yet
at
the
same
time
with
terrific
speed
it
dived
behind
the
ragged
curtain
of
the
clouds
and
the
space
closed
up
again
blackness
returned
upon
the
heavens
and
through
this
blackness
plunging
into
that
abyss
of
woe
whence
he
had
momentarily
risen
the
figure
of
the
marvellous
stranger
melted
utterly
away
delane
for
a
fleeting
second
was
aware
of
the
earnestness
in
the
sad
imploring
countenance
of
its
sweetness
and
its
power
so
strangely
mingled
of
it
mysterious
grandeur
and
of
its
pathetic
childishness
but
already
it
was
sunk
into
interminable
distance
a
star
that
would
be
baleful
yet
was
merely
glorious
passed
on
its
endless
wandering
among
the
teeming
systems
of
the
universe
behind
the
fixed
and
steady
stars
secure
in
their
appointed
places
it
set
it
vanished
into
the
pit
of
unknown
emptiness
it
was
gone
god
help
you
sighed
across
the
sea
of
wailing
branches
echoing
down
the
dark
abyss
below
god
give
you
rest
at
last
for
he
saw
a
princely
nay
an
imperial
being
homeless
for
ever
and
for
ever
wandering
hunted
as
by
keen
remorseless
winds
about
a
universe
that
held
no
corner
for
his
feet
his
majesty
unworshipped
his
reign
a
mockery
his
court
unfurnished
and
his
courtiers
mere
shadows
of
deep
space
and
a
thin
grey
dawn
stealing
up
behind
clearing
summits
in
the
east
crept
then
against
the
windows
of
the
mountain
hut
it
brought
with
it
a
treacherous
sharp
air
that
made
the
sleeper
draw
another
blanket
near
to
shelter
him
from
the
sudden
cold
for
the
fire
had
died
out
and
an
icy
draught
sucked
steadily
beneath
the
doorway
xii
a
bit
of
wood
he
found
himself
in
meran
with
some
cousins
who
had
various
slight
ailments
but
being
rich
and
imaginative
had
gone
to
a
sanatorium
to
be
cured
but
for
its
sanatoria
meran
might
be
a
cheerful
place
their
ubiquity
reminds
a
healthy
man
too
often
that
the
air
is
really
good
being
well
enough
himself
except
for
a
few
mental
worries
he
went
to
a
gasthaus
in
the
neighbourhood
in
the
sanatorium
his
cousins
complained
bitterly
of
the
food
the
ignorant
sisters
the
inattentive
doctors
and
the
idiotic
regulations
generally
which
proves
that
people
should
not
go
to
a
sanatorium
unless
they
are
really
ill
however
they
paid
heavily
for
being
there
so
felt
that
something
was
being
accomplished
and
were
annoyed
when
he
called
each
day
for
tea
and
told
them
cheerfully
how
much
better
they
looked
which
proved
again
that
their
ailments
were
slight
and
quite
curable
by
the
local
doctor
at
home
with
one
of
the
ailing
cousins
a
rich
and
pretty
girl
he
believed
himself
in
love
it
was
a
three
weeks
business
and
he
spent
his
mornings
walking
in
the
surrounding
hills
his
mind
reflective
analytical
and
ambitious
as
with
a
man
in
love
he
thought
of
thousands
of
things
he
mooned
once
for
instance
he
paused
beside
a
rivulet
to
watch
the
buttercups
dip
and
asked
himself
will
she
be
like
this
when
we
married
so
anxious
to
be
well
that
she
thinks
fearfully
all
the
time
of
getting
ill
for
if
so
he
felt
he
would
be
bored
he
knew
himself
accurately
enough
to
realise
that
he
never
could
stand
yet
money
was
a
wonderful
thing
to
have
and
he
already
had
little
enough
am
i
influenced
by
her
money
then
he
asked
himself
and
so
went
on
to
ask
and
wonder
about
many
things
besides
for
he
was
of
a
reflective
temperament
and
his
father
had
been
a
minor
poet
and
doubt
crept
in
he
felt
a
chill
he
was
not
much
of
a
man
perhaps
and
unsuccessful
rather
a
dreamer
too
into
the
bargain
he
had
a
year
of
his
own
and
a
position
in
a
philanthropic
institution
due
to
influence
with
a
nominal
salary
attached
he
meant
to
keep
the
latter
after
marriage
he
would
work
just
the
same
nobody
should
ever
say
of
him
and
as
he
sat
on
the
fallen
tree
beside
the
rivulet
idly
knocking
stones
into
the
rushing
water
with
his
stick
he
reflected
upon
those
banal
truisms
that
epitomise
of
life
the
way
little
unimportant
things
can
change
a
person
whole
existence
was
the
one
his
thought
just
now
had
fastened
on
his
cousin
chill
and
headache
for
instance
caught
at
a
gloomy
picnic
on
the
campagna
three
weeks
before
had
led
to
her
going
into
a
sanatorium
and
being
advised
that
her
heart
was
weak
that
she
had
a
tendency
to
asthma
that
gout
was
in
her
system
and
that
a
treatment
of
radium
and
light
baths
violet
rays
no
meat
complete
rest
with
big
daily
fees
to
experts
with
european
reputations
were
imperative
from
that
chill
sitting
a
moment
too
long
in
the
shadow
of
a
forgotten
tomb
he
reflected
has
come
all
this
all
this
including
his
doubt
as
to
whether
it
was
herself
or
her
money
that
he
loved
whether
he
could
stand
living
with
her
always
whether
he
need
keep
his
work
on
after
marriage
in
a
word
his
entire
life
and
future
and
her
own
as
well
all
from
that
tiny
chill
three
weeks
ago
and
he
knocked
with
his
stick
a
little
piece
of
board
that
lay
beside
the
rushing
water
upon
that
bit
of
wood
his
mind
his
mood
then
fastened
itself
it
was
triangular
a
piece
of
wood
brown
with
age
and
ragged
once
it
had
been
part
of
a
triumphant
hopeful
sapling
on
the
mountains
then
when
thirty
years
of
age
the
men
had
cut
it
down
the
rest
of
it
stood
somewhere
now
at
this
very
moment
in
the
walls
of
the
house
this
extra
bit
was
cast
away
as
useless
it
served
no
purpose
anywhere
it
was
slowly
rotting
in
the
sun
but
each
tap
of
the
stick
he
noticed
turned
it
sideways
without
sending
it
over
the
edge
into
the
rushing
water
it
was
obstinate
it
does
want
to
go
in
he
laughed
his
father
little
talent
cropping
out
in
him
but
by
jove
it
shall
and
he
pushed
it
with
his
foot
but
again
it
stopped
stuck
against
a
stone
he
then
stooped
picked
it
up
and
threw
it
in
it
plopped
and
splashed
and
went
scurrying
away
downhill
with
the
bubbling
water
even
that
scrap
of
useless
wood
he
reflected
rising
to
continue
his
aimless
walk
and
still
idly
dreaming
even
that
bit
of
rubbish
may
have
a
purpose
and
may
change
the
life
of
someone
somewhere
and
then
went
strolling
through
the
fragrant
pine
woods
crossing
a
dozen
similar
streams
and
hitting
scores
of
stones
and
scraps
and
fir
cones
as
he
went
till
he
finally
reached
his
gasthaus
an
hour
later
and
found
a
note
from
we
shall
expect
you
about
three
we
thought
of
going
for
a
drive
the
others
feel
so
much
better
it
was
a
revealing
touch
the
way
she
put
it
on
the
others
he
made
his
mind
up
then
and
there
thus
tiny
things
divide
the
course
of
life
that
he
could
never
be
happy
with
such
an
affected
creature
he
went
for
that
drive
sat
next
to
her
consuming
beauty
proposed
to
her
passionately
on
the
way
back
was
accepted
before
he
could
change
his
mind
and
is
now
the
father
of
several
healthy
children
and
just
as
much
afraid
of
getting
ill
or
of
getting
ill
as
she
was
fifteen
years
before
the
female
of
course
matures
long
long
before
the
male
he
reflected
thinking
the
matter
over
in
his
study
once
and
that
scrap
of
wood
he
idly
set
in
motion
out
of
impulse
also
went
its
destined
way
upon
the
hurrying
water
that
never
dared
to
stop
proud
of
its
motion
it
bobbed
down
merrily
spinning
and
turning
for
a
mile
or
so
dancing
gaily
over
sunny
meadows
brushing
the
dipping
buttercups
as
it
passed
through
vineyards
woods
and
under
dusty
roads
in
neat
cool
gutters
and
tumbling
headlong
over
little
waterfalls
until
it
neared
the
plain
and
so
finally
it
came
to
a
wooden
trough
that
led
off
some
of
the
precious
water
to
a
sawmill
where
men
did
practical
and
necessary
things
at
the
parting
of
the
ways
its
angles
delayed
it
for
a
moment
undecided
which
way
to
take
it
wobbled
and
upon
that
moment
wobbling
hung
tragic
issues
issues
of
life
and
death
unknowing
yet
assuredly
not
unknown
it
chose
the
trough
it
swung
into
the
tearing
sluice
it
whirled
with
the
gush
of
water
towards
the
wheel
banged
spun
trembled
caught
fast
in
the
side
where
the
cogs
just
chanced
to
be
and
abruptly
stopped
the
wheel
at
any
other
spot
the
pressure
of
the
water
must
have
smashed
it
into
pulp
and
the
wheel
have
continued
as
before
but
it
was
caught
in
the
place
where
the
various
tensions
held
it
fast
immovably
it
stopped
the
wheel
and
so
the
machinery
of
the
entire
mill
it
jammed
like
iron
the
particular
angle
at
which
the
saw
held
by
two
weary
and
perspiring
men
had
cut
it
off
a
year
before
just
enabled
it
to
fit
and
wedge
itself
with
irresistible
exactitude
the
pressure
of
the
tearing
water
combined
with
the
weight
of
the
massive
wheel
to
fix
it
tight
and
rigid
and
in
due
course
a
workman
it
was
the
foreman
of
the
mill
came
from
his
post
inside
to
make
investigations
he
discovered
the
irritating
item
that
caused
the
trouble
he
put
his
weight
in
a
certain
way
he
strained
his
hefty
muscles
he
swore
and
the
scrap
of
wood
was
easily
dislodged
he
fished
the
morsel
out
and
tossed
it
on
the
bank
and
spat
on
it
the
great
wheel
started
with
a
mighty
groan
but
it
started
a
fraction
of
a
second
before
he
expected
it
would
start
he
overbalanced
clutching
the
revolving
framework
with
a
frantic
effort
shouted
swore
leaped
at
nothing
and
fell
into
the
pouring
flood
in
an
instant
he
was
turned
upside
down
sucked
under
drowned
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
and
had
put
by
a
thousand
in
the
he
was
a
sober
and
man
there
was
a
paragraph
in
the
local
paper
two
days
later
the
englishman
asking
the
porter
of
his
gasthaus
for
something
to
wrap
up
a
present
he
was
taking
to
his
cousin
in
the
sanatorium
used
that
very
issue
as
he
folded
its
crumpled
and
recalcitrant
sheets
with
sentimental
care
about
the
precious
object
his
eye
fell
carelessly
upon
the
paragraph
being
of
an
idle
and
reflective
temperament
he
stopped
to
read
it
it
was
headed
unglücksfall
and
his
poetic
eye
inherited
from
his
foolish
rhyming
father
caught
the
pretty
expression
fliessandes
wasser
he
read
the
first
few
lines
some
fellow
with
a
picturesque
tyrolese
name
had
been
drowned
beneath
a
he
was
popular
in
the
neighbourhood
it
seemed
he
had
saved
some
money
and
was
just
going
to
be
married
it
was
very
sad
our
sympathy
was
with
him
and
being
of
a
reflective
temperament
the
englishman
thought
for
a
moment
while
he
went
on
wrapping
up
the
parcel
he
wondered
if
the
man
had
really
loved
the
girl
whether
she
too
had
money
and
whether
they
would
have
had
lots
of
children
and
been
happy
ever
afterwards
and
then
he
hurried
out
towards
the
sanatorium
i
shall
be
late
he
reflected
such
little
unimportant
things
delay
one
xiii
a
victim
of
higher
space
there
a
hextraordinary
gentleman
to
see
you
sir
said
the
new
man
why
asked
dr
silence
drawing
the
tips
of
his
thin
fingers
through
his
brown
beard
his
eyes
twinkled
pleasantly
why
barker
he
repeated
encouragingly
noticing
the
perplexed
expression
in
the
man
eyes
he
so
so
thin
sir
i
could
hardly
see
at
all
at
first
he
was
inside
the
house
before
i
could
ask
the
name
he
added
remembering
strict
orders
and
who
brought
him
here
he
come
alone
sir
in
a
closed
cab
he
pushed
by
me
before
i
could
say
a
word
making
no
noise
not
what
i
could
hear
he
seemed
to
move
so
soft
like
the
man
stopped
short
with
obvious
embarrassment
as
though
he
had
already
said
enough
to
jeopardise
his
new
situation
but
trying
hard
to
show
that
he
remembered
the
instructions
and
warnings
he
had
received
with
regard
to
the
admission
of
strangers
not
properly
accredited
and
where
is
the
gentleman
now
asked
dr
silence
turning
away
to
conceal
his
amusement
i
really
could
exactly
say
sir
i
left
him
standing
in
the
the
doctor
looked
up
sharply
but
why
in
the
hall
barker
why
not
in
the
he
fixed
his
piercing
though
kindly
eyes
on
the
man
face
did
he
frighten
you
he
asked
quickly
i
think
he
did
sir
if
i
may
say
so
i
seemed
to
lose
sight
of
him
as
it
were
the
man
stammered
evidently
convinced
by
now
that
he
had
earned
his
dismissal
he
come
in
so
funny
just
like
a
cold
wind
he
added
boldly
setting
his
heels
at
attention
and
looking
his
master
full
in
the
face
the
doctor
made
an
internal
note
of
the
man
halting
description
he
was
pleased
that
the
slight
signs
of
psychic
intuition
which
had
induced
him
to
engage
barker
had
not
entirely
failed
at
the
first
trial
dr
silence
sought
for
this
qualification
in
all
his
assistants
from
secretary
to
serving
man
and
if
it
surrounded
him
with
a
somewhat
singular
crew
the
drawbacks
were
more
than
compensated
for
on
the
whole
by
their
occasional
flashes
of
insight
so
the
gentleman
made
you
feel
queer
did
he
that
was
it
i
think
sir
repeated
the
man
stolidly
and
he
brings
no
kind
of
introduction
to
me
no
letter
or
anything
asked
the
doctor
with
feigned
surprise
as
though
he
knew
what
was
coming
the
man
fumbled
both
in
mind
and
pockets
and
finally
produced
an
envelope
i
beg
pardon
sir
he
said
greatly
flustered
the
gentleman
handed
me
this
for
you
it
was
a
note
from
a
discerning
friend
who
had
never
yet
sent
him
a
case
that
was
not
vitally
interesting
from
one
point
or
another
please
see
the
bearer
of
this
note
the
brief
message
ran
though
i
doubt
if
even
you
can
do
much
to
help
him
john
silence
paused
a
moment
so
as
to
gather
from
the
mind
of
the
writer
all
that
lay
behind
the
brief
words
of
the
letter
then
he
looked
up
at
his
servant
with
a
graver
expression
than
he
had
yet
worn
go
back
and
find
this
gentleman
he
said
and
show
him
into
the
green
study
do
not
reply
to
his
question
or
speak
more
than
actually
necessary
but
think
kind
helpful
sympathetic
thoughts
as
strongly
as
you
can
barker
you
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
importance
of
when
i
engaged
you
put
curiosity
out
of
your
mind
and
think
gently
sympathetically
affectionately
if
you
can
he
smiled
and
barker
who
had
recovered
his
composure
in
the
presence
bowed
silently
and
went
out
there
were
two
different
in
dr
silence
house
one
intended
for
persons
who
imagined
they
needed
spiritual
assistance
when
really
they
were
only
candidates
for
the
asylum
had
padded
walls
and
was
well
supplied
with
various
concealed
contrivances
by
means
of
which
sudden
violence
could
be
instantly
met
and
overcome
it
was
however
rarely
used
the
other
intended
for
the
reception
of
genuine
cases
of
spiritual
distress
and
afflictions
of
a
psychic
nature
was
entirely
draped
and
furnished
in
a
soothing
deep
green
calculated
to
induce
calmness
and
repose
of
mind
and
this
room
was
the
one
in
which
dr
silence
interviewed
the
majority
of
his
queer
cases
and
the
one
into
which
he
had
directed
barker
to
show
his
present
caller
to
begin
with
the
in
which
the
patient
was
always
directed
to
sit
was
nailed
to
the
floor
since
its
immovability
tended
to
impart
this
same
excellent
characteristic
to
the
occupant
patients
invariably
grew
excited
when
talking
about
themselves
and
their
excitement
tended
to
confuse
their
thoughts
and
to
exaggerate
their
language
the
inflexibility
of
the
chair
helped
to
counteract
this
after
repeated
endeavours
to
drag
it
forward
or
push
it
back
they
ended
by
resigning
themselves
to
sitting
quietly
and
with
the
futility
of
fidgeting
there
followed
a
calmer
state
of
mind
upon
the
floor
and
at
intervals
in
the
wall
immediately
behind
were
certain
tiny
green
buttons
practically
unnoticeable
which
on
being
pressed
permitted
a
soothing
and
persuasive
narcotic
to
rise
invisibly
about
the
occupant
of
the
chair
the
effect
upon
the
excitable
patient
was
rapid
admirable
and
harmless
the
green
study
was
further
provided
with
a
secret
for
john
silence
liked
when
possible
to
observe
his
patient
face
before
it
had
assumed
that
mask
the
features
of
the
human
countenance
invariably
wear
in
the
presence
of
another
person
a
man
sitting
alone
wears
a
psychic
expression
and
this
expression
is
the
man
himself
it
disappears
the
moment
another
person
joins
him
and
dr
silence
often
learned
more
from
a
few
moments
secret
observation
of
a
face
than
from
hours
of
conversation
with
its
owner
afterwards
a
very
light
almost
a
dancing
step
followed
barker
heavy
tread
towards
the
green
room
and
a
moment
afterwards
the
man
came
in
and
announced
that
the
gentleman
was
waiting
he
was
still
pale
and
his
manner
nervous
never
mind
barker
the
doctor
said
kindly
if
you
were
not
psychic
the
man
would
have
had
no
effect
upon
you
at
all
you
only
need
training
and
development
and
when
you
have
learned
to
interpret
these
feelings
and
sensations
better
you
will
feel
no
fear
but
only
a
great
sympathy
yes
sir
thank
you
sir
and
barker
bowed
and
made
his
escape
while
dr
silence
an
amused
smile
lurking
about
the
corners
of
his
mouth
made
his
way
noiselessly
down
the
passage
and
put
his
eye
to
the
in
the
door
of
the
green
study
this
was
so
placed
that
it
commanded
a
view
of
almost
the
entire
room
and
looking
through
it
the
doctor
saw
a
hat
gloves
and
umbrella
lying
on
a
chair
by
the
table
but
searched
at
first
in
vain
for
their
owner
the
windows
were
both
closed
and
a
brisk
fire
burned
in
the
grate
there
were
various
signs
signs
intelligible
at
least
to
a
keenly
intuitive
soul
that
the
room
was
occupied
yet
so
far
as
human
beings
were
concerned
it
was
empty
utterly
empty
no
one
sat
in
the
chairs
no
one
stood
on
the
mat
before
the
fire
there
was
no
sign
even
that
a
patient
was
anywhere
close
against
the
wall
examining
the
böcklin
reproductions
as
patients
so
often
did
when
they
thought
they
were
alone
and
therefore
rather
difficult
to
see
from
the
ordinarily
speaking
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
it
was
undeniable
yet
dr
silence
was
quite
well
aware
that
a
human
being
in
the
room
his
psychic
apparatus
never
failed
in
letting
him
know
the
proximity
of
an
incarnate
or
discarnate
being
even
in
the
dark
he
could
tell
that
and
he
now
knew
positively
that
his
patient
the
patient
who
had
alarmed
barker
and
had
then
tripped
down
the
corridor
with
that
dancing
footstep
was
somewhere
concealed
within
the
four
walls
commanded
by
his
he
also
realised
and
this
was
most
unusual
that
this
individual
whom
he
desired
to
watch
knew
that
he
was
being
watched
and
further
that
the
stranger
himself
was
also
watching
in
fact
that
it
was
he
the
doctor
who
was
being
observed
and
by
an
observer
as
keen
and
trained
as
himself
an
inkling
of
the
true
state
of
the
case
began
to
dawn
upon
him
and
he
was
on
the
verge
of
entering
indeed
his
hand
already
touched
the
when
his
eye
still
glued
to
the
detected
a
slight
movement
directly
opposite
between
him
and
the
fireplace
something
stirred
he
watched
very
attentively
and
made
certain
that
he
was
not
mistaken
an
object
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
a
blue
vase
disappeared
from
view
it
passed
out
of
sight
together
with
the
portion
of
the
marble
mantelpiece
on
which
it
rested
next
that
part
of
the
fire
and
grate
and
brass
fender
immediately
below
it
vanished
entirely
as
though
a
slice
had
been
taken
clean
out
of
them
dr
silence
then
understood
that
something
between
him
and
these
objects
was
slowly
coming
into
being
something
that
concealed
them
and
obstructed
his
vision
by
inserting
itself
in
the
line
of
sight
between
them
and
himself
he
quietly
awaited
further
results
before
going
in
first
he
saw
a
thin
perpendicular
line
tracing
itself
from
just
above
the
height
of
the
clock
and
continuing
downwards
till
it
reached
the
woolly
this
line
grew
wider
broadened
grew
solid
it
was
no
shadow
it
was
something
substantial
it
defined
itself
more
and
more
then
suddenly
at
the
top
of
the
line
and
about
on
a
level
with
the
face
of
the
clock
he
saw
a
round
luminous
disc
gazing
steadily
at
him
it
was
a
human
eye
looking
straight
into
his
own
pressed
there
against
the
and
it
was
bright
with
intelligence
dr
silence
held
his
breath
for
a
moment
and
stared
back
at
it
then
like
some
one
moving
out
of
deep
shadow
into
light
he
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
come
sliding
sideways
into
view
a
whitish
face
following
the
eye
and
the
perpendicular
line
he
had
first
observed
broadening
out
and
developing
into
the
complete
figure
of
a
human
being
it
was
the
patient
he
had
apparently
been
standing
there
in
front
of
the
fire
all
the
time
a
second
eye
had
followed
the
first
and
both
of
them
stared
steadily
at
the
sharply
concentrated
yet
with
a
sly
twinkle
of
humour
and
amusement
that
made
it
impossible
for
the
doctor
to
maintain
his
position
any
longer
he
opened
the
door
and
went
in
quickly
as
he
did
so
he
noticed
for
the
first
time
the
sound
of
a
german
band
coming
in
gaily
through
the
open
ventilators
in
some
intuitive
unaccountable
fashion
the
music
connected
itself
with
the
patient
he
was
about
to
interview
this
sort
of
prevision
was
not
unfamiliar
to
him
it
always
explained
itself
later
the
man
he
saw
was
of
middle
age
and
of
very
ordinary
appearance
so
ordinary
in
fact
that
he
was
difficult
to
describe
his
only
peculiarity
being
his
extreme
thinness
pleasant
that
is
good
vibrations
issued
from
his
atmosphere
and
met
dr
silence
as
he
advanced
to
greet
him
yet
vibrations
alive
with
currents
and
discharges
betraying
the
perturbed
and
disordered
condition
of
his
mind
and
brain
there
was
evidently
something
wholly
out
of
the
usual
in
the
state
of
his
thoughts
yet
though
strange
it
was
not
altogether
distressing
it
was
not
the
impression
that
the
broken
and
violent
atmosphere
of
the
insane
produces
upon
the
mind
dr
silence
realised
in
a
flash
that
here
was
a
case
of
absorbing
interest
that
might
require
all
his
powers
to
handle
properly
i
was
watching
you
through
my
little
as
you
saw
he
began
with
a
pleasant
smile
advancing
to
shake
hands
i
find
it
of
the
greatest
assistance
sometimes
but
the
patient
interrupted
him
at
once
his
voice
was
hurried
and
had
odd
shrill
changes
in
it
breaking
from
high
to
low
in
unexpected
fashion
one
moment
it
thundered
the
next
it
almost
squeaked
i
understand
without
explanation
he
broke
in
rapidly
you
get
the
true
note
of
a
man
in
this
way
when
he
thinks
himself
unobserved
i
quite
agree
only
in
my
case
i
fear
you
saw
very
little
my
case
as
you
of
course
grasp
dr
silence
is
extremely
peculiar
uncomfortably
peculiar
indeed
unless
sir
william
had
positively
assured
me
my
friend
has
sent
you
to
me
the
doctor
interrupted
gravely
with
a
gentle
note
of
authority
and
that
is
quite
sufficient
pray
be
seated
mudge
racine
mudge
returned
the
other
take
this
comfortable
one
mudge
leading
him
to
the
fixed
chair
and
tell
me
your
condition
in
your
own
way
and
at
your
own
pace
my
whole
day
is
at
your
service
if
you
require
it
mudge
moved
towards
the
chair
in
question
and
then
hesitated
you
will
promise
me
not
to
use
the
narcotic
buttons
he
said
before
sitting
down
i
do
not
need
them
also
i
ought
to
mention
that
anything
you
think
of
vividly
will
reach
my
mind
that
is
apparently
part
of
my
peculiar
case
he
sat
down
with
a
sigh
and
arranged
his
thin
legs
and
body
into
a
position
of
comfort
evidently
he
was
very
sensitive
to
the
thoughts
of
others
for
the
picture
of
the
green
buttons
had
only
entered
the
doctor
mind
for
a
second
yet
the
other
had
instantly
snapped
it
up
dr
silence
noticed
too
that
mudge
held
on
tightly
with
both
hands
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
i
rather
glad
the
chair
is
nailed
to
the
floor
he
remarked
as
he
settled
himself
more
comfortably
it
suits
me
admirably
the
fact
is
and
this
is
my
case
in
a
nutshell
which
is
all
that
a
doctor
of
your
marvellous
development
requires
the
fact
is
dr
silence
i
am
a
victim
of
higher
space
that
what
the
matter
with
me
higher
space
the
two
looked
at
each
other
for
a
space
in
silence
the
little
patient
holding
tightly
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
which
suited
him
admirably
and
looking
up
with
staring
eyes
his
atmosphere
positively
trembling
with
the
waves
of
some
unknown
activity
while
the
doctor
smiled
kindly
and
sympathetically
and
put
his
whole
person
as
far
as
possible
into
the
mental
condition
of
the
other
higher
space
repeated
mudge
that
what
it
is
now
do
you
think
you
can
help
me
with
there
was
a
pause
during
which
the
men
eyes
steadily
searched
down
below
the
surface
of
their
respective
personalities
then
dr
silence
spoke
i
am
quite
sure
i
can
help
he
answered
quietly
sympathy
must
always
help
and
suffering
always
owns
my
sympathy
i
see
you
have
suffered
cruelly
you
must
tell
me
all
about
your
case
and
when
i
hear
the
gradual
steps
by
which
you
reached
this
strange
condition
i
have
no
doubt
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
you
he
drew
a
chair
up
beside
his
interlocutor
and
laid
a
hand
on
his
shoulder
for
a
moment
his
whole
being
radiated
kindness
intelligence
desire
to
help
for
instance
he
went
on
i
feel
sure
it
was
the
result
of
no
mere
chance
that
you
became
familiar
with
the
terrors
of
what
you
term
higher
space
for
higher
space
is
no
mere
external
measurement
it
is
of
course
a
spiritual
state
a
spiritual
condition
an
inner
development
and
one
that
we
must
recognise
as
abnormal
since
it
is
beyond
the
reach
of
the
world
at
the
present
stage
of
evolution
higher
space
is
a
mythical
state
oh
cried
the
other
rubbing
his
birdlike
hands
with
pleasure
the
relief
it
is
to
be
to
talk
to
some
one
who
can
understand
of
course
what
you
say
is
the
utter
truth
and
you
are
right
that
no
mere
chance
led
me
to
my
present
condition
but
on
the
other
hand
prolonged
and
deliberate
study
yet
chance
in
a
sense
now
governs
it
i
mean
my
entering
the
condition
of
higher
space
seems
to
depend
upon
the
chance
of
this
and
that
circumstance
for
instance
the
mere
sound
of
that
german
band
sent
me
off
not
that
all
music
will
do
so
but
certain
sounds
certain
vibrations
at
once
key
me
up
to
the
requisite
pitch
and
off
i
go
wagner
music
always
does
it
and
that
band
must
have
been
playing
a
stray
bit
of
wagner
but
i
come
to
all
that
later
only
first
i
must
ask
you
to
send
away
your
man
from
the
john
silence
looked
up
with
a
start
for
mudge
back
was
to
the
door
and
there
was
no
mirror
he
saw
the
brown
eye
of
barker
glued
to
the
little
circle
of
glass
and
he
crossed
the
room
without
a
word
and
snapped
down
the
black
shutter
provided
for
the
purpose
and
then
heard
barker
shuffle
away
along
the
passage
now
continued
the
little
man
in
the
chair
i
can
begin
you
have
managed
to
put
me
completely
at
my
ease
and
i
feel
i
may
tell
you
my
whole
case
without
shame
or
reserve
you
will
understand
but
you
must
be
patient
with
me
if
i
go
into
details
that
are
already
familiar
to
you
details
of
higher
space
i
mean
and
if
i
seem
stupid
when
i
have
to
describe
things
that
transcend
the
power
of
language
and
are
really
therefore
indescribable
my
dear
friend
put
in
the
other
calmly
that
goes
without
saying
to
know
higher
space
is
an
experience
that
defies
description
and
one
is
obliged
to
make
use
of
more
or
less
intelligible
symbols
but
pray
proceed
your
vivid
thoughts
will
tell
me
more
than
your
halting
words
an
immense
sigh
of
relief
proceeded
from
the
little
figure
half
lost
in
the
depths
of
the
chair
such
intelligent
sympathy
meeting
him
was
a
new
experience
to
him
and
it
touched
his
heart
at
once
he
leaned
back
relaxing
his
tight
hold
of
the
arms
and
began
in
his
thin
voice
my
mother
was
a
frenchwoman
and
my
father
an
essex
bargeman
he
said
abruptly
hence
my
name
racine
and
mudge
my
father
died
before
i
ever
saw
him
my
mother
inherited
money
from
her
bordeaux
relations
and
when
she
died
soon
after
i
was
left
alone
with
wealth
and
a
strange
freedom
i
had
no
guardian
trustees
sisters
brothers
or
any
connection
in
the
world
to
look
after
me
i
grew
up
therefore
utterly
without
education
this
much
was
to
my
advantage
i
learned
none
of
that
deceitful
rubbish
taught
in
schools
and
so
had
nothing
to
unlearn
when
i
awakened
to
my
true
love
mathematics
higher
mathematics
and
higher
geometry
these
however
i
seemed
to
know
instinctively
it
was
like
the
memory
of
what
i
had
deeply
studied
before
the
principles
were
in
my
blood
and
i
simply
raced
through
the
ordinary
stages
and
beyond
and
then
did
the
same
with
geometry
afterwards
when
i
read
the
books
on
these
subjects
i
understood
how
swift
and
undeviating
the
knowledge
had
come
back
to
me
it
was
simply
memory
it
was
simply
the
memories
of
what
i
had
known
before
in
a
previous
existence
and
required
no
books
to
teach
me
in
his
growing
excitement
mudge
attempted
to
drag
the
chair
forward
a
little
nearer
to
his
listener
and
then
smiled
faintly
as
he
resigned
himself
instantly
again
to
its
immovability
and
plunged
anew
into
the
recital
of
his
singular
disease
the
audacious
speculations
of
bolyai
the
amazing
theories
of
gauss
that
through
a
point
more
than
one
line
could
be
drawn
parallel
to
a
given
line
the
possibility
that
the
angles
of
a
triangle
are
together
than
two
right
angles
if
drawn
upon
immense
breathless
intuitions
of
beltrami
and
lobatchewsky
all
these
i
hurried
through
and
emerged
panting
but
unsatisfied
upon
the
verge
of
my
my
new
world
my
higher
space
possibilities
in
a
word
my
disease
how
i
got
there
he
resumed
after
a
brief
pause
during
which
he
appeared
to
be
listening
intently
for
an
approaching
sound
is
more
than
i
can
put
intelligibly
into
words
i
can
only
hope
to
leave
your
mind
with
an
intuitive
comprehension
of
the
possibility
of
what
i
say
here
however
came
a
change
at
this
point
i
was
no
longer
absorbing
the
fruits
of
studies
i
had
made
before
it
was
the
beginning
of
new
efforts
to
learn
for
the
first
time
and
i
had
to
go
slowly
and
laboriously
through
terrible
work
here
i
sought
for
the
theories
and
speculations
of
others
but
books
were
few
and
far
between
and
with
the
exception
of
one
man
a
the
world
called
him
whose
audacity
and
piercing
intuition
amazed
and
delighted
me
beyond
description
i
found
no
one
to
guide
or
help
you
of
course
dr
silence
understand
something
of
what
i
am
driving
at
with
these
stammering
words
though
you
can
not
perhaps
yet
guess
what
depths
of
pain
my
new
knowledge
brought
me
to
nor
why
an
acquaintance
with
a
new
development
of
space
should
prove
a
source
of
misery
and
terror
racine
mudge
remembering
that
the
chair
would
not
move
did
the
next
best
thing
he
could
in
his
desire
to
draw
nearer
to
the
attentive
man
facing
him
and
sat
forward
upon
the
very
edge
of
the
cushions
crossing
his
legs
and
gesticulating
with
both
hands
as
though
he
saw
into
this
region
of
new
space
he
was
attempting
to
describe
and
might
any
moment
tumble
into
it
bodily
from
the
edge
of
the
chair
and
disappear
from
view
john
silence
separated
from
him
by
three
paces
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
thin
white
face
opposite
noting
every
word
and
every
gesture
with
deep
attention
this
room
we
now
sit
in
dr
silence
has
one
side
open
to
space
to
higher
space
a
closed
box
only
closed
there
is
a
way
in
and
out
of
a
soap
bubble
without
breaking
the
skin
you
tell
me
no
new
thing
the
doctor
interposed
gently
hence
if
higher
space
exists
and
our
world
borders
upon
it
and
lies
partially
in
it
it
follows
necessarily
that
we
see
only
portions
of
all
objects
we
never
see
their
true
and
complete
shape
we
see
their
three
measurements
but
not
their
fourth
the
new
direction
is
concealed
from
us
and
when
i
hold
this
book
and
move
my
hand
all
round
it
i
have
not
really
made
a
complete
circuit
we
only
perceive
those
portions
of
any
object
which
exist
in
our
three
dimensions
the
rest
escapes
us
but
once
we
learn
to
see
in
higher
space
and
objects
will
appear
as
they
actually
are
only
they
will
thus
be
hardly
recognisable
now
you
may
begin
to
grasp
something
of
what
i
am
coming
to
i
am
beginning
to
understand
something
of
what
you
must
have
suffered
observed
the
doctor
soothingly
for
i
have
made
similar
experiments
myself
and
only
stopped
just
in
time
you
are
the
one
man
in
all
the
world
who
can
hear
and
understand
sympathise
exclaimed
mudge
grasping
his
hand
and
holding
it
tightly
while
he
spoke
the
nailed
chair
prevented
further
excitability
well
he
resumed
after
a
moment
pause
i
procured
the
implements
and
the
coloured
blocks
for
practical
experiment
and
i
followed
the
instructions
carefully
till
i
had
arrived
at
a
working
conception
of
space
the
tessaract
the
figure
whose
boundaries
are
cubes
i
knew
by
heart
that
is
to
say
i
knew
it
and
saw
it
mentally
for
my
eye
of
course
could
never
take
in
a
new
measurement
or
my
hands
and
feet
handle
it
so
at
least
i
thought
he
added
making
a
wry
face
i
had
reached
the
stage
you
see
when
i
could
in
a
new
dimension
i
was
able
to
conceive
the
shape
of
that
new
figure
which
is
intrinsically
different
to
all
we
know
the
shape
of
the
tessaract
i
could
perceive
in
four
dimensions
when
therefore
i
looked
at
a
cube
i
could
see
all
its
sides
at
once
its
top
was
not
foreshortened
nor
its
farther
side
and
base
invisible
i
saw
the
whole
thing
out
flat
so
to
speak
and
this
tessaract
was
bounded
by
cubes
moreover
i
also
saw
its
content
its
insides
you
were
not
yourself
able
to
enter
this
new
world
interrupted
dr
silence
not
then
i
was
only
able
to
conceive
intuitively
what
it
was
like
and
how
exactly
it
must
look
later
when
i
slipped
in
there
and
saw
objects
in
their
entirety
unlimited
by
the
paucity
of
our
poor
three
measurements
i
very
nearly
lost
my
life
for
you
see
space
does
not
stop
at
a
single
new
dimension
a
fourth
it
extends
in
all
possible
new
ones
and
we
must
conceive
it
as
containing
any
number
of
new
dimensions
in
other
words
there
is
no
space
at
all
but
only
a
spiritual
condition
but
meanwhile
i
had
come
to
grasp
the
strange
fact
that
the
objects
in
our
normal
world
appear
to
us
only
partially
mudge
moved
farther
forward
till
he
was
balanced
dangerously
on
the
very
edge
of
the
chair
from
this
starting
point
he
resumed
i
began
my
studies
and
experiments
and
continued
them
for
years
i
had
money
and
i
was
without
friends
i
lived
in
solitude
and
experimented
my
intellect
of
course
had
little
part
in
the
work
for
intellectually
it
was
all
unthinkable
never
was
the
limitation
of
mere
reason
more
plainly
demonstrated
it
was
mystically
intuitively
spiritually
that
i
began
to
advance
and
what
i
learnt
and
knew
and
did
is
all
impossible
to
put
into
language
since
it
all
describes
experiences
transcending
the
experiences
of
men
it
is
only
some
of
the
results
what
you
would
call
the
symptoms
of
my
disease
that
i
can
give
you
and
even
these
must
often
appear
absurd
contradictions
and
impossible
paradoxes
i
can
only
tell
you
dr
silence
his
manner
became
exceedingly
impressive
that
i
reached
sometimes
a
point
of
view
whence
all
the
great
puzzle
of
the
world
became
plain
to
me
and
i
understood
what
they
call
in
the
yoga
books
great
heresy
of
separateness
why
all
great
teachers
have
urged
the
necessity
of
man
loving
his
neighbour
as
himself
how
men
are
all
really
and
why
the
utter
loss
of
self
is
necessary
to
salvation
and
the
discovery
of
the
true
life
of
the
soul
he
paused
a
moment
and
drew
breath
your
speculations
have
been
my
own
long
ago
the
doctor
said
quietly
i
fully
realise
the
force
of
your
words
men
are
doubtless
not
separate
at
all
in
the
sense
they
imagine
all
this
about
the
very
much
higher
space
i
only
dimly
very
dimly
conceived
of
course
the
other
went
on
raising
his
voice
again
by
jerks
but
what
did
happen
to
me
was
the
humbler
accident
of
the
simpler
disaster
oh
dear
how
shall
i
put
it
he
stammered
and
showed
visible
signs
of
distress
it
was
simply
this
he
resumed
with
a
sudden
rush
of
words
that
accidentally
as
the
result
of
my
years
of
experiment
i
one
day
slipped
bodily
into
the
next
world
the
world
of
four
dimensions
yet
without
knowing
precisely
how
i
got
there
or
how
i
could
get
back
again
i
discovered
that
is
that
my
ordinary
body
was
but
an
expression
a
projection
of
my
higher
body
now
you
understand
what
i
meant
much
earlier
in
our
talk
when
i
spoke
of
chance
i
can
not
control
my
entrance
or
exit
certain
people
certain
human
atmospheres
certain
wandering
forces
thoughts
desires
even
the
radiations
of
certain
combinations
of
colour
and
above
all
the
vibrations
of
certain
kinds
of
music
will
suddenly
throw
me
into
a
state
of
what
i
can
only
describe
as
an
intense
and
terrific
inner
vibration
and
behold
i
am
off
off
in
the
direction
at
right
angles
to
all
our
known
directions
off
in
the
direction
the
cube
takes
when
it
begins
to
trace
the
outlines
of
the
new
figure
off
into
my
breathless
and
higher
space
off
into
the
world
of
four
dimensions
he
gasped
and
dropped
back
into
the
depths
of
the
immovable
chair
and
there
he
whispered
his
voice
issuing
from
among
the
cushions
there
i
have
to
stay
until
these
vibrations
subside
or
until
they
do
something
which
i
can
not
find
words
to
describe
properly
or
intelligibly
to
you
and
then
behold
i
am
back
again
first
that
is
i
disappear
then
i
reappear
just
so
exclaimed
dr
silence
and
that
is
why
a
few
why
a
few
moments
ago
interrupted
mudge
taking
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
you
found
me
gone
and
then
saw
me
return
the
music
of
that
wretched
german
band
sent
me
off
your
intense
thinking
about
me
brought
me
back
when
the
band
had
stopped
its
wagner
i
saw
you
approach
the
and
i
saw
barker
intention
of
doing
so
later
for
me
no
interiors
are
hidden
i
see
inside
when
in
that
state
the
content
of
your
mind
as
of
your
body
is
open
to
me
as
the
day
oh
dear
oh
dear
oh
dear
mudge
stopped
and
again
mopped
his
brow
a
light
trembling
ran
over
the
surface
of
his
small
body
like
wind
over
grass
he
still
held
tightly
to
the
arms
of
the
chair
at
first
he
presently
resumed
my
new
experiences
were
so
vividly
interesting
that
i
felt
no
alarm
there
was
no
room
for
it
the
alarm
came
a
little
later
then
you
actually
penetrated
far
enough
into
that
state
to
experience
yourself
as
a
normal
portion
of
it
asked
the
doctor
leaning
forward
deeply
interested
mudge
nodded
a
perspiring
face
in
reply
i
did
he
whispered
undoubtedly
i
did
i
am
coming
to
all
that
it
began
first
at
night
when
i
realised
that
sleep
brought
no
loss
of
consciousness
the
spirit
of
course
can
never
sleep
only
the
body
becomes
unconscious
interposed
john
silence
yes
we
know
that
theoretically
at
night
of
course
the
spirit
is
active
elsewhere
and
we
have
no
memory
of
where
and
how
simply
because
the
brain
stays
behind
and
receives
no
record
but
i
found
that
while
remaining
conscious
i
also
retained
memory
i
had
attained
to
the
state
of
continuous
consciousness
for
at
night
i
regularly
with
the
first
approaches
of
drowsiness
entered
the
world
for
a
time
this
happened
regularly
and
i
could
not
control
it
though
later
i
found
a
way
to
regulate
it
better
apparently
sleep
is
unnecessary
in
the
higher
the
body
yes
perhaps
but
i
should
infinitely
have
preferred
dull
sleep
to
the
knowledge
for
unable
to
control
my
movements
i
wandered
to
and
fro
attracted
owing
to
my
partial
development
and
premature
arrival
to
parts
of
this
new
world
that
alarmed
me
more
and
more
it
was
the
awful
waste
and
drift
of
a
monstrous
world
so
utterly
different
to
all
we
know
and
see
that
i
can
not
even
hint
at
the
nature
of
the
sights
and
objects
and
beings
in
it
more
than
that
i
can
not
even
remember
them
i
can
not
now
picture
them
to
myself
even
but
can
recall
only
the
of
the
they
made
upon
me
the
horror
and
devastating
terror
of
it
all
to
be
in
several
places
at
once
for
instance
perfectly
interrupted
john
silence
noticing
the
increase
of
the
other
excitement
i
understand
exactly
but
now
please
tell
me
a
little
more
of
this
alarm
you
experienced
and
how
it
affected
you
it
not
the
disappearing
and
reappearing
that
i
mind
continued
mudge
so
much
as
certain
other
things
it
seeing
people
and
objects
in
their
weird
entirety
in
their
true
and
complete
shapes
that
is
so
distressing
it
introduces
me
to
a
world
of
monsters
horses
dogs
cats
all
of
which
i
loved
people
trees
children
all
that
i
have
considered
beautiful
in
life
everything
from
a
human
face
to
a
cathedral
appear
to
me
in
a
different
shape
and
aspect
to
all
i
have
known
before
i
can
not
perhaps
convince
you
why
this
should
be
terrible
but
i
assure
you
that
it
is
so
to
hear
the
human
voice
proceeding
from
this
novel
appearance
which
i
scarcely
recognise
as
a
human
body
is
ghastly
simply
ghastly
to
see
inside
everything
and
everybody
is
a
form
of
insight
peculiarly
distressing
to
be
so
confused
in
geography
as
to
find
myself
one
moment
at
the
north
pole
and
the
next
at
clapham
junction
or
possibly
at
both
places
simultaneously
is
absurdly
terrifying
your
imagination
will
readily
furnish
other
details
without
my
multiplying
my
experiences
now
but
you
have
no
idea
what
it
all
means
and
how
i
suffer
mudge
paused
in
his
panting
account
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
he
still
held
tightly
to
the
arms
as
though
they
could
keep
him
in
the
world
of
sanity
and
three
measurements
and
only
now
and
again
released
his
left
hand
in
order
to
mop
his
face
he
looked
very
thin
and
white
and
oddly
unsubstantial
and
he
stared
about
him
as
though
he
saw
into
this
other
space
he
had
been
talking
about
john
silence
too
felt
warm
he
had
listened
to
every
word
and
had
made
many
notes
the
presence
of
this
man
had
an
exhilarating
effect
upon
him
it
seemed
as
if
racine
mudge
still
carried
about
with
him
something
of
that
breathless
condition
he
had
been
describing
at
any
rate
dr
silence
had
himself
advanced
sufficiently
far
along
the
legitimate
paths
of
spiritual
and
psychic
transformations
to
realise
that
the
visions
of
this
extraordinary
little
person
had
a
basis
of
truth
for
their
origin
after
a
pause
that
prolonged
itself
into
minutes
he
crossed
the
room
and
unlocked
a
drawer
in
a
bookcase
taking
out
a
small
book
with
a
red
cover
it
had
a
lock
to
it
and
he
produced
a
key
out
of
his
pocket
and
proceeded
to
open
the
covers
the
bright
eyes
of
mudge
never
left
him
for
a
single
second
it
almost
seems
a
pity
he
said
at
length
to
cure
you
mudge
you
are
on
the
way
to
discovery
of
great
things
though
you
may
lose
your
life
in
the
process
that
is
your
life
here
in
the
world
of
three
dimensions
you
would
lose
thereby
nothing
of
great
value
you
will
pardon
my
apparent
rudeness
i
know
and
you
might
gain
what
is
infinitely
greater
your
suffering
of
course
lies
in
the
fact
that
you
alternate
between
the
two
worlds
and
are
never
wholly
in
one
or
the
other
also
i
rather
imagine
though
i
can
not
be
certain
of
this
from
any
personal
experiments
that
you
have
here
and
there
penetrated
even
into
space
of
more
than
four
dimensions
and
have
hence
experienced
the
terror
you
speak
of
the
perspiring
son
of
the
essex
bargeman
and
the
woman
of
normandy
bent
his
head
several
times
in
assent
but
uttered
no
word
in
reply
some
strange
psychic
predisposition
dating
no
doubt
from
one
of
your
former
lives
has
favoured
the
development
of
your
and
the
fact
that
you
had
no
normal
training
at
school
or
college
no
leading
by
the
poor
intellect
into
the
falsely
called
knowledge
has
further
caused
your
exceedingly
rapid
movement
along
the
lines
of
direct
inner
experience
none
of
the
knowledge
you
have
foreshadowed
has
come
to
you
through
the
senses
of
course
mudge
sitting
in
his
immovable
chair
began
to
tremble
slightly
a
wind
again
seemed
to
pass
over
his
surface
and
again
to
set
it
curiously
in
motion
like
a
field
of
grass
you
are
merely
talking
to
gain
time
he
said
hurriedly
in
a
shaking
voice
this
thinking
aloud
delays
us
i
see
ahead
what
you
are
coming
to
only
please
be
quick
for
something
is
going
to
happen
a
band
is
again
coming
down
the
street
and
if
it
plays
if
it
plays
wagner
i
shall
be
off
in
a
twinkling
precisely
i
will
be
quick
i
was
leading
up
to
the
point
of
how
to
effect
your
cure
the
way
is
this
you
must
simply
learn
to
the
true
true
utterly
true
exclaimed
the
little
man
dodging
about
nervously
in
the
depths
of
the
chair
but
how
in
the
name
of
space
is
that
to
be
done
by
concentration
they
are
all
within
you
these
entrances
although
outer
cases
such
as
colour
music
and
other
things
lead
you
towards
them
these
external
things
you
can
not
hope
to
destroy
but
once
the
entrances
are
blocked
they
will
lead
you
only
to
bricked
walls
and
closed
channels
you
will
no
longer
be
able
to
find
the
way
quick
quick
cried
the
bobbing
figure
in
the
chair
how
is
this
concentration
to
be
effected
this
little
book
continued
dr
silence
calmly
will
explain
to
you
the
way
he
tapped
the
cover
let
me
now
read
out
to
you
certain
simple
instructions
composed
as
i
see
you
divine
entirely
from
my
own
personal
experiences
in
the
same
direction
follow
these
instructions
and
you
will
no
longer
enter
the
state
of
higher
space
the
entrances
will
be
blocked
effectively
mudge
sat
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
to
listen
and
john
silence
cleared
his
throat
and
began
to
read
slowly
in
a
very
distinct
voice
but
before
he
had
uttered
a
dozen
words
something
happened
a
sound
of
street
music
entered
the
room
through
the
open
ventilators
for
a
band
had
begun
to
play
in
the
stable
mews
at
the
back
of
the
house
the
march
from
odd
as
it
may
seem
that
a
german
band
should
twice
within
the
space
of
an
hour
enter
the
same
mews
and
play
wagner
it
was
nevertheless
the
fact
racine
mudge
heard
it
he
uttered
a
sharp
squeaking
cry
and
twisted
his
arms
with
nervous
energy
round
the
chair
a
piteous
look
that
was
not
far
from
tears
spread
over
his
white
face
grey
shadows
followed
it
the
grey
of
fear
he
began
to
struggle
convulsively
hold
me
fast
catch
me
for
god
sake
keep
me
here
i
on
the
rush
already
oh
it
frightful
he
cried
in
tones
of
anguish
his
voice
as
thin
as
a
reed
dr
silence
made
a
plunge
forward
to
seize
him
but
in
a
flash
before
he
could
cover
the
space
between
them
racine
mudge
screaming
and
struggling
seemed
to
shoot
past
him
into
invisibility
he
disappeared
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
propelled
at
infinite
speed
and
his
voice
no
longer
sounded
in
the
external
air
but
seemed
in
some
curious
way
to
make
itself
heard
somewhere
within
the
depths
of
the
doctor
own
being
it
was
almost
like
a
faint
singing
cry
in
his
head
like
a
voice
of
dream
a
voice
of
vision
and
unreality
alcohol
alcohol
it
cried
give
me
alcohol
it
the
quickest
way
alcohol
before
i
out
of
reach
the
doctor
accustomed
to
rapid
decisions
and
even
more
rapid
action
remembered
that
a
brandy
flask
stood
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
in
less
than
a
second
he
had
seized
it
and
was
holding
it
out
towards
the
space
above
the
chair
recently
occupied
by
the
visible
mudge
then
before
his
very
eyes
and
long
ere
he
could
unscrew
the
metal
stopper
he
saw
the
contents
of
the
closed
glass
phial
sink
and
lessen
as
though
some
one
were
drinking
violently
and
greedily
of
the
liquor
within
thanks
enough
it
deadens
the
vibrations
cried
the
faint
voice
in
his
interior
as
he
withdrew
the
flask
and
set
it
back
upon
the
mantelpiece
he
understood
that
in
mudge
present
condition
one
side
of
the
flask
was
open
to
space
and
he
could
drink
without
removing
the
stopper
he
could
hardly
have
had
a
more
interesting
proof
of
what
he
had
been
hearing
described
at
such
length
but
the
next
moment
the
very
same
moment
it
almost
seemed
the
german
band
stopped
midway
in
its
tune
and
there
was
mudge
back
in
his
chair
again
gasping
and
panting
quick
he
shrieked
stop
that
band
send
it
away
catch
hold
of
me
block
the
entrances
block
the
entrances
give
me
the
red
book
oh
oh
the
music
had
begun
again
it
was
merely
a
temporary
interruption
the
march
started
again
this
time
at
a
tremendous
pace
that
made
it
sound
like
a
rapid
as
though
the
instruments
played
against
time
but
the
brief
interruption
gave
dr
silence
a
moment
in
which
to
collect
his
scattering
thoughts
and
before
the
band
had
got
through
half
a
bar
he
had
flung
forward
upon
the
chair
and
held
racine
mudge
the
struggling
little
victim
of
higher
space
in
a
grip
of
iron
his
arms
went
all
round
his
diminutive
person
taking
in
a
good
part
of
the
chair
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
a
big
man
yet
he
seemed
to
smother
mudge
completely
yet
even
as
he
did
so
and
felt
the
wriggling
form
underneath
him
it
began
to
melt
and
slip
away
like
air
or
water
the
wood
of
the
somehow
disentangled
itself
from
between
his
own
arms
and
those
of
mudge
the
phenomenon
known
as
the
passage
of
matter
through
matter
took
place
the
little
man
seemed
actually
to
get
mixed
up
in
his
own
being
dr
silence
could
just
see
his
face
beneath
him
it
puckered
and
grew
dark
as
though
from
some
great
internal
effort
he
heard
the
thin
reedy
voice
cry
in
his
ear
to
block
the
entrances
block
the
entrances
and
then
but
how
in
the
world
describe
what
is
indescribable
john
silence
half
rose
up
to
watch
racine
mudge
his
face
distorted
beyond
all
recognition
was
making
a
marvellous
inward
movement
as
though
doubling
back
upon
himself
he
turned
like
water
in
a
whirling
vortex
and
then
appeared
to
break
up
somewhat
as
a
reflection
breaks
up
and
divides
in
a
distorting
convex
mirror
he
went
neither
forward
nor
backwards
neither
to
the
right
nor
the
left
neither
up
nor
down
but
he
went
he
went
utterly
he
simply
flashed
away
out
of
sight
like
a
vanishing
projectile
all
but
one
leg
dr
silence
just
had
the
time
and
the
presence
of
mind
to
seize
upon
the
left
ankle
and
boot
as
it
disappeared
and
to
this
he
held
on
for
several
seconds
like
grim
death
yet
all
the
time
he
knew
it
was
a
foolish
and
useless
thing
to
do
the
foot
was
in
his
grasp
one
moment
and
the
next
it
seemed
this
was
the
only
way
he
could
describe
it
inside
his
own
skin
and
bones
and
at
the
same
time
outside
his
hand
and
all
round
it
it
seemed
mixed
up
in
some
amazing
way
with
his
own
flesh
and
blood
then
it
was
gone
and
he
was
tightly
grasping
a
draught
of
heated
air
gone
gone
gone
cried
a
thick
whispering
voice
somewhere
deep
within
his
own
consciousness
lost
lost
lost
it
repeated
growing
fainter
and
fainter
till
at
length
it
vanished
into
nothing
and
the
last
signs
of
racine
mudge
vanished
with
it
john
silence
locked
his
red
book
and
replaced
it
in
the
cabinet
which
he
fastened
with
a
click
and
when
barker
answered
the
bell
he
inquired
if
mudge
had
left
a
card
upon
the
table
it
appeared
that
he
had
and
when
the
servant
returned
with
it
dr
silence
read
the
address
and
made
a
note
of
it
it
was
in
north
london
mudge
has
gone
he
said
quietly
to
barker
noticing
his
expression
of
alarm
he
not
taken
his
with
him
sir
mudge
requires
no
hat
where
he
is
now
continued
the
doctor
stooping
to
poke
the
fire
but
he
may
return
for
it
and
the
humbrella
sir
and
the
umbrella
he
did
go
out
way
sir
if
you
please
stuttered
the
amazed
servant
his
curiosity
overcoming
his
nervousness
mudge
has
his
own
way
of
coming
and
going
and
prefers
it
if
he
returns
by
the
door
at
any
time
remember
to
bring
him
instantly
to
me
and
be
kind
and
gentle
with
him
and
ask
no
questions
also
remember
barker
to
think
pleasantly
sympathetically
affectionately
of
him
while
he
is
away
mudge
is
a
very
suffering
gentleman
barker
bowed
and
went
out
of
the
room
backwards
gasping
and
feeling
round
the
inside
of
his
collar
with
three
very
hot
fingers
of
one
hand
it
was
two
days
later
when
he
brought
in
a
telegram
to
the
study
dr
silence
opened
it
and
read
as
follows
bombay
just
slipped
out
again
all
safe
have
blocked
entrances
thousand
thanks
address
cooks
mudge
dr
silence
looked
up
and
saw
barker
staring
at
him
bewilderingly
it
occurred
to
him
that
somehow
he
knew
the
contents
of
the
telegram
make
a
parcel
of
mudge
things
he
said
briefly
and
address
them
thomas
cook
sons
ludgate
circus
and
send
them
there
exactly
a
month
from
and
marked
be
called
for
yes
sir
said
barker
leaving
the
room
with
a
deep
sigh
and
a
hurried
glance
at
the
basket
where
his
master
had
dropped
the
pink
paper
xiv
transition
john
mudbury
was
on
his
way
home
from
the
shops
his
arms
full
of
christmas
presents
it
was
after
six
and
the
streets
were
very
crowded
he
was
an
ordinary
man
lived
in
an
ordinary
suburban
flat
with
an
ordinary
wife
and
four
ordinary
children
did
not
think
them
ordinary
but
everybody
else
did
he
had
ordinary
presents
for
each
one
a
cheap
blotter
for
his
wife
a
cheap
for
the
eldest
boy
and
so
forth
he
was
over
fifty
bald
in
an
office
decent
in
mind
and
habits
of
uncertain
opinions
uncertain
politics
and
uncertain
religion
yet
he
considered
himself
a
decided
positive
gentleman
quite
unaware
that
the
morning
newspaper
determined
his
opinions
for
the
day
he
just
lived
from
day
to
day
physically
he
was
fit
enough
except
for
a
weak
heart
which
never
troubled
him
and
his
summer
holiday
was
bad
golf
while
the
children
bathed
and
his
wife
read
garvice
on
the
sands
like
the
majority
of
men
he
dreamed
idly
of
the
past
muddled
away
the
present
and
guessed
vaguely
after
imaginative
reading
on
occasions
at
the
future
i
like
to
survive
all
right
he
said
provided
it
better
than
this
surveying
his
wife
and
children
and
thinking
of
his
daily
toil
otherwise
and
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
a
brave
man
should
he
went
to
church
regularly
but
nothing
in
church
him
that
he
did
survive
just
as
nothing
in
church
enticed
him
into
hoping
that
he
would
on
the
other
hand
nothing
in
life
persuaded
him
that
he
did
would
could
i
an
evolutionist
he
loved
to
say
to
thoughtful
cronies
over
a
glass
having
never
heard
that
darwinism
had
been
questioned
and
so
he
came
home
gaily
happily
with
his
bunch
of
christmas
presents
for
the
wife
and
little
ones
stroking
himself
upon
their
keen
enjoyment
and
excitement
the
night
before
he
had
taken
the
wife
to
see
at
a
select
london
theatre
where
the
intellectuals
went
and
had
been
extraordinarily
stirred
he
had
gone
questioningly
yet
expecting
something
out
of
the
common
it
musical
he
warned
her
nor
farce
nor
comedy
so
to
speak
and
in
answer
to
her
question
as
to
what
the
critics
had
said
he
had
wriggled
sighed
and
put
his
gaudy
necktie
straight
four
times
in
quick
succession
for
no
man
in
the
street
with
any
claim
to
could
be
expected
to
understand
what
the
critics
had
said
even
if
he
understood
the
play
and
john
had
answered
truthfully
oh
they
just
said
things
but
the
theatre
always
full
and
that
the
only
test
and
just
now
as
he
crossed
the
crowded
circus
to
catch
his
it
chanced
that
his
mind
having
glimpsed
an
advertisement
was
full
of
this
particular
play
or
rather
of
the
effect
it
had
produced
upon
him
at
the
time
for
it
had
him
inexplicably
with
its
marvellous
speculative
hint
its
big
audacity
its
alert
and
spiritual
beauty
thought
plunged
to
find
something
plunged
after
this
bizarre
suggestion
of
a
bigger
universe
after
this
suggestion
that
man
is
not
the
only
then
dashed
against
a
sentence
that
memory
thrust
beneath
his
nose
science
does
exhaust
the
universe
and
at
the
same
time
dashed
against
destruction
of
another
kind
as
well
how
it
happened
he
never
exactly
knew
he
saw
a
monster
glaring
at
him
with
eyes
of
blazing
fire
it
was
horrible
it
rushed
upon
him
he
dodged
another
monster
met
him
round
the
corner
both
came
at
him
simultaneously
he
dodged
again
a
leap
that
might
have
cleared
a
hurdle
easily
but
was
too
late
between
the
pair
of
them
his
heart
literally
in
his
gullet
he
was
mercilessly
caught
bones
crunched
there
was
a
soft
sensation
icy
cold
and
hot
as
fire
horns
and
voices
roared
he
saw
and
a
carapace
of
iron
then
dazzling
light
always
the
traffic
he
remembered
with
a
frantic
yell
and
by
some
extraordinary
luck
escaped
miraculously
on
to
the
opposite
pavement
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
by
the
skin
of
his
teeth
he
had
dodged
a
rather
ugly
death
first
he
felt
for
his
presents
all
were
safe
and
then
instead
of
congratulating
himself
and
taking
breath
he
hurried
homewards
which
proved
that
his
mind
had
lost
control
a
bit
thinking
only
how
disappointed
the
wife
and
children
would
have
been
if
if
anything
had
happened
another
thing
he
realised
oddly
enough
was
that
he
no
longer
really
his
wife
but
had
only
great
affection
for
her
what
made
him
think
of
that
heaven
only
knows
but
he
think
of
it
he
was
an
honest
man
without
pretence
this
came
as
a
discovery
somehow
he
turned
a
moment
and
saw
the
crowd
gathered
about
the
entangled
taxicabs
helmets
gleaming
in
the
lights
of
the
shop
windows
then
hurried
on
again
his
thoughts
full
of
the
joy
his
presents
would
give
of
the
scampering
children
and
of
his
wife
bless
her
silly
heart
eyeing
the
mysterious
parcels
and
though
he
never
could
explain
he
presently
stood
at
the
door
of
the
building
that
contained
his
flat
having
walked
the
whole
three
miles
his
thoughts
had
been
so
busy
and
absorbed
that
he
had
hardly
noticed
the
length
of
weary
trudge
besides
he
reflected
thinking
of
the
narrow
escape
i
had
a
nasty
shock
it
was
a
d
d
near
thing
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
did
feel
a
bit
shaky
and
bewildered
yet
at
the
same
time
he
felt
extraordinarily
jolly
and
he
counted
his
christmas
parcels
hugged
himself
in
anticipatory
joy
and
let
himself
in
swiftly
with
his
latchkey
i
late
he
realised
but
when
she
sees
the
parcels
she
forget
to
say
a
word
god
bless
the
old
faithful
soul
and
he
softly
used
the
key
a
second
time
and
entered
his
flat
on
tiptoe
in
his
mind
was
the
master
impulse
of
that
afternoon
the
pleasure
these
christmas
presents
would
give
his
wife
and
children
he
heard
a
noise
he
hung
up
hat
and
coat
in
the
pokey
vestibule
they
never
called
it
hall
and
moved
softly
towards
the
parlour
door
holding
the
packages
behind
him
only
of
them
he
thought
not
of
himself
of
his
family
that
is
not
of
the
packages
pushing
the
door
cunningly
ajar
he
peeped
in
slyly
to
his
amazement
the
room
was
full
of
people
he
withdrew
quickly
wondering
what
it
meant
a
party
and
without
his
knowing
about
it
extraordinary
keen
disappointment
came
over
him
but
as
he
stepped
back
the
vestibule
he
saw
was
full
of
people
too
he
was
uncommonly
surprised
yet
somehow
not
surprised
at
all
people
were
congratulating
him
there
was
a
perfect
mob
of
them
moreover
he
knew
them
all
vaguely
remembered
them
at
least
and
they
all
knew
him
is
it
a
game
laughed
some
one
patting
him
on
the
back
have
the
least
idea
and
the
speaker
it
was
old
john
palmer
the
bookkeeper
at
the
office
emphasised
the
they
not
the
least
idea
he
answered
with
a
smile
saying
something
he
did
understand
yet
knew
was
right
his
face
apparently
showed
the
utter
bewilderment
he
felt
the
shock
of
the
collision
had
been
greater
than
he
realised
evidently
his
mind
was
wandering
possibly
only
the
odd
thing
was
he
had
never
felt
so
in
his
life
ten
thousand
things
grew
simple
suddenly
but
how
thickly
these
people
pressed
about
him
and
how
familiarly
my
parcels
he
said
joyously
pushing
his
way
across
the
throng
these
are
christmas
presents
i
bought
for
them
he
nodded
toward
the
room
i
saved
for
weeks
stopped
cigars
and
billiards
and
and
several
other
good
things
to
buy
them
good
man
said
palmer
with
a
happy
laugh
it
the
heart
that
counts
mudbury
looked
at
him
palmer
had
said
an
amazing
truth
only
people
would
hardly
understand
and
believe
him
would
they
eh
he
asked
feeling
stuffed
and
stupid
muddled
somewhere
between
two
meanings
one
of
which
was
gorgeous
and
the
other
stupid
beyond
belief
if
you
mudbury
step
inside
they
are
expecting
you
said
a
kindly
pompous
voice
and
turning
sharply
he
met
the
gentle
foolish
eyes
of
sir
james
epiphany
a
director
of
the
bank
where
he
worked
the
effect
of
the
voice
was
instantaneous
from
long
habit
they
are
he
smiled
from
his
heart
and
advanced
as
from
the
custom
of
many
years
oh
how
happy
and
gay
he
felt
his
affection
for
his
wife
was
real
romance
indeed
had
gone
but
he
needed
her
and
she
needed
him
and
the
children
milly
bill
and
jean
he
deeply
loved
them
life
worth
living
indeed
in
the
room
was
a
crowd
but
an
astounding
silence
john
mudbury
looked
round
him
he
advanced
towards
his
wife
who
sat
in
the
corner
with
milly
on
her
knee
a
lot
of
people
talked
and
moved
about
momentarily
the
crowd
increased
he
stood
in
front
of
them
in
front
of
milly
and
his
wife
and
he
spoke
holding
out
his
packages
it
christmas
eve
he
whispered
shyly
and
i
brought
you
something
something
for
everybody
look
he
held
the
packages
before
their
eyes
of
course
of
course
said
a
voice
behind
him
but
you
may
hold
them
out
like
that
for
a
century
they
see
them
of
course
they
wo
but
i
love
to
do
the
old
sweet
thing
replied
john
mudbury
then
wondered
with
a
gasp
of
stark
amazement
why
he
said
it
think
whispered
milly
staring
round
her
well
do
you
think
her
mother
asked
sharply
you
always
thinking
something
queer
i
think
the
child
continued
dreamily
that
daddy
already
here
she
paused
then
added
with
a
child
impossible
conviction
i
sure
he
is
i
him
there
was
an
extraordinary
laugh
sir
james
epiphany
laughed
the
others
the
whole
crowd
of
them
also
turned
their
heads
and
smiled
but
the
mother
thrusting
the
child
away
from
her
rose
up
suddenly
with
a
violent
start
her
face
had
turned
to
chalk
she
stretched
her
arms
out
into
the
air
before
her
she
gasped
and
shivered
there
was
an
awful
anguish
in
her
eyes
look
repeated
john
these
are
the
presents
that
i
brought
but
his
voice
apparently
was
soundless
and
with
a
spasm
of
icy
pain
he
remembered
that
palmer
and
sir
james
some
years
ago
had
died
it
magic
he
cried
but
i
love
you
jinny
i
love
you
and
and
i
have
always
been
true
to
you
as
true
as
steel
we
need
each
other
oh
ca
you
see
we
go
on
together
you
and
i
for
ever
and
ever
interrupted
an
exquisitely
tender
voice
do
shout
ca
hear
you
now
and
turning
john
mudbury
met
the
eyes
of
everard
minturn
their
president
of
the
year
before
minturn
had
gone
down
with
the
he
dropped
his
parcels
then
his
heart
gave
an
enormous
leap
of
joy
he
saw
her
face
the
face
of
his
wife
look
through
him
but
the
child
gazed
straight
into
his
eyes
she
him
the
next
thing
he
knew
was
that
he
heard
something
tinkling
far
far
away
it
sounded
miles
below
him
inside
him
he
was
sounding
himself
all
utterly
bewildering
like
a
bell
it
a
bell
milly
stooped
down
and
picked
the
parcels
up
her
face
shone
with
happiness
and
laughter
but
a
man
came
in
soon
after
a
man
with
a
ridiculous
solemn
face
a
pencil
and
a
notebook
he
wore
a
dark
blue
helmet
behind
him
came
a
string
of
other
men
they
carried
something
something
he
could
not
see
exactly
what
it
was
but
when
he
pressed
forward
through
the
laughing
throng
to
gaze
upon
it
he
dimly
made
out
two
eyes
a
nose
a
chin
a
deep
red
smear
and
a
pair
of
folded
hands
upon
an
overcoat
a
woman
form
fell
down
upon
them
then
and
he
heard
soft
sounds
of
children
weeping
strangely
and
other
sounds
sounds
as
of
familiar
voices
laughing
laughing
gaily
they
join
us
presently
it
goes
like
a
flash
and
turning
with
great
happiness
in
his
heart
he
saw
that
sir
james
had
said
it
holding
palmer
by
the
arm
as
with
some
natural
yet
unexpected
love
of
sympathetic
friendship
come
on
said
palmer
smiling
like
a
man
who
accepts
a
gift
in
universal
fellowship
let
help
they
never
understand
still
we
can
always
try
the
entire
throng
moved
up
with
laughter
and
amusement
it
was
a
moment
of
hearty
genuine
life
at
last
delight
and
joy
and
peace
were
everywhere
then
john
mudbury
realised
the
truth
that
he
was
xv
the
tradition
the
noises
outside
the
little
flat
at
first
were
very
disconcerting
after
living
in
the
country
they
made
sleep
difficult
at
the
cottage
in
sussex
where
the
family
had
lived
night
brought
deep
comfortable
silence
unless
the
wind
was
high
when
the
pine
trees
round
the
made
a
sound
like
surf
or
if
the
gale
was
from
the
the
orchard
roared
a
bit
unpleasantly
but
in
london
it
was
very
different
sleep
was
easier
in
the
daytime
than
at
night
for
after
nightfall
the
rumble
of
the
traffic
became
spasmodic
instead
of
continuous
the
startled
like
warnings
of
alarm
after
comparative
silence
the
furious
rushing
of
a
touched
the
nerves
from
dinner
till
eleven
the
streets
subsided
gradually
then
came
the
army
from
theatres
parties
and
late
dinners
hurrying
home
to
bed
the
during
this
hour
were
lively
and
incessant
like
bugles
of
a
regiment
moving
into
battle
the
parents
rarely
retired
until
this
attack
was
over
if
quick
about
it
sleep
was
possible
then
before
the
flying
of
the
an
uncertain
squadron
screamed
half
the
street
awake
again
but
these
finally
disposed
of
a
delightful
hush
settled
down
upon
the
neighbourhood
profounder
far
than
any
peace
of
the
countryside
the
deep
rumble
of
the
produce
wagons
coming
in
to
the
big
london
markets
from
the
farms
generally
about
three
held
no
disturbing
quality
but
sometimes
in
the
stillness
of
very
early
morning
when
streets
were
empty
and
pavements
all
deserted
there
was
a
sound
of
another
kind
that
was
startling
and
unwelcome
for
it
was
ominous
it
came
with
a
clattering
violence
that
made
nerves
quiver
and
forced
the
heart
to
pause
and
listen
a
strange
resonance
was
in
it
a
volume
of
sound
moreover
that
was
hardly
justified
by
its
cause
for
it
was
hoofs
a
horse
swept
hurrying
up
the
deserted
street
and
was
close
upon
the
building
in
a
moment
it
was
audible
suddenly
no
gradual
approach
from
a
distance
but
as
though
it
turned
a
corner
from
soft
ground
that
muffled
the
hoofs
on
to
the
echoing
hard
paving
that
emphasised
the
dreadful
clatter
nor
did
it
die
away
again
when
once
the
house
was
reached
it
ceased
as
abruptly
as
it
came
the
hoofs
did
not
go
away
it
was
the
mother
who
heard
them
first
and
drew
her
attention
to
their
disagreeable
quality
it
is
the
dear
he
answered
they
go
at
four
to
catch
the
early
trains
into
the
country
she
looked
up
sharply
as
though
something
in
his
tone
surprised
her
but
there
no
sound
of
wheels
she
said
and
then
as
he
did
not
reply
she
added
gravely
you
have
heard
it
too
john
i
can
tell
i
have
he
said
i
have
heard
it
twice
and
they
looked
at
one
another
searchingly
each
trying
to
read
the
other
mind
she
did
not
question
him
he
did
not
propose
writing
to
complain
in
a
newspaper
both
understood
something
that
neither
of
them
understood
i
heard
it
first
she
then
said
softly
the
night
before
jack
got
the
fever
and
as
i
listened
i
heard
him
crying
but
when
i
went
in
to
see
he
was
asleep
the
noise
stopped
just
outside
the
building
there
was
a
shadow
in
her
eyes
as
she
said
this
and
a
hush
crept
in
between
her
words
i
did
not
hear
it
she
said
this
almost
beneath
her
breath
he
looked
a
moment
at
the
ground
then
coming
towards
her
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
kissed
her
and
she
clung
very
tightly
to
him
sometimes
he
said
in
a
quiet
voice
a
mounted
policeman
passes
down
the
street
i
think
it
is
a
horse
she
answered
but
whether
it
was
a
question
or
mere
corroboration
he
did
not
ask
for
at
that
moment
the
doctor
arrived
and
the
question
of
little
jack
health
became
the
paramount
matter
of
immediate
interest
the
great
man
verdict
was
uncommonly
disquieting
all
that
night
they
sat
up
in
the
sick
room
it
was
strangely
still
as
though
by
one
accord
the
traffic
avoided
the
house
where
a
little
boy
hung
between
life
and
death
the
even
had
a
muffled
sound
and
heavy
drays
and
wagons
used
the
wide
streets
there
were
fewer
taxicabs
about
or
else
they
flew
by
noiselessly
yet
no
straw
was
down
the
expense
prohibited
that
and
towards
morning
very
early
the
mother
decided
to
watch
alone
she
had
been
a
trained
nurse
before
her
marriage
accustomed
when
she
was
younger
to
long
vigils
you
go
down
dear
and
get
a
little
sleep
she
urged
in
a
whisper
he
quiet
now
at
five
i
come
for
you
to
take
my
place
you
fetch
me
at
once
he
whispered
if
then
hesitated
as
though
breath
failed
him
a
moment
he
stood
there
staring
from
her
face
to
the
bed
if
you
hear
anything
he
finished
she
nodded
and
he
went
downstairs
to
his
study
not
to
his
bedroom
he
left
the
door
ajar
he
sat
in
darkness
listening
mother
he
knew
was
listening
too
beside
the
bed
his
heart
was
very
full
for
he
did
not
believe
the
boy
could
live
till
morning
the
picture
of
the
room
was
all
the
time
before
his
eyes
the
shaded
lamp
the
table
with
the
medicines
the
little
wasted
figure
beneath
the
blankets
and
mother
close
beside
it
listening
he
sat
alert
ready
to
fly
upstairs
at
the
smallest
cry
but
no
sound
broke
the
stillness
the
entire
neighbourhood
was
silent
all
london
slept
he
heard
the
clock
strike
three
in
the
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
it
was
still
enough
for
that
there
was
not
even
the
heavy
rumble
of
a
single
produce
wagon
though
usually
they
passed
about
this
time
on
their
way
to
smithfield
and
covent
garden
markets
he
waited
far
too
anxious
to
close
his
eyes
at
four
he
would
go
up
and
relieve
her
vigil
four
he
knew
was
the
time
when
life
sinks
to
its
lowest
ebb
then
in
the
middle
of
his
reflections
thought
stopped
dead
and
it
seemed
his
heart
stopped
too
far
away
but
coming
nearer
with
extraordinary
rapidity
a
sharp
clear
sound
broke
out
of
the
surrounding
stillness
a
horse
hoofs
at
first
it
was
so
distant
that
it
might
have
been
almost
on
the
high
roads
of
the
country
but
the
amazing
speed
with
which
it
came
closer
and
the
sudden
increase
of
the
beating
sound
was
such
that
by
the
time
he
turned
his
head
it
seemed
to
have
entered
the
street
outside
it
was
within
a
hundred
yards
of
the
building
the
next
second
it
was
before
the
very
door
and
something
in
him
blenched
he
knew
a
complete
paralysis
the
abrupt
cessation
of
the
heavy
clatter
was
strangest
of
all
it
came
like
lightning
it
struck
it
paused
it
did
not
go
away
again
yet
the
sound
of
it
was
still
beating
in
his
ears
as
he
dashed
upstairs
three
steps
at
a
time
it
seemed
in
the
house
as
well
on
the
stairs
behind
him
in
the
little
the
very
it
was
an
appalling
sound
yet
he
entered
a
room
that
was
quiet
orderly
and
calm
it
was
silent
beside
the
bed
his
wife
sat
holding
jack
hand
and
stroking
it
she
was
soothing
him
her
face
was
very
peaceful
no
sound
but
her
gentle
whisper
was
audible
he
controlled
himself
by
a
tremendous
effort
but
his
face
betrayed
his
consternation
and
distress
hush
she
said
beneath
her
breath
he
sleeping
much
more
calmly
now
the
crisis
bless
god
is
over
i
do
believe
i
dared
not
leave
him
he
saw
in
a
moment
that
she
was
right
and
an
untenable
relief
passed
over
him
he
sat
down
beside
her
very
cold
yet
perspiring
with
heat
you
heard
he
asked
after
a
pause
nothing
she
replied
quickly
except
his
pitiful
wild
words
when
the
delirium
was
on
him
it
passed
it
lasted
but
a
moment
or
have
called
you
he
stared
closely
into
her
tired
eyes
and
his
words
he
asked
in
a
whisper
whereupon
she
told
him
quietly
that
the
little
chap
had
sat
up
with
eyes
and
talked
excitedly
about
a
great
great
horse
he
heard
but
that
was
not
coming
for
him
he
laughed
and
said
he
would
not
go
with
it
because
he
not
ready
yet
some
scrap
of
talk
he
had
overheard
from
us
she
added
when
we
discussed
the
traffic
once
but
you
heard
nothing
he
repeated
almost
impatiently
no
she
had
heard
nothing
after
all
then
he
dozed
a
moment
in
his
chair
four
weeks
later
jack
entirely
convalescent
was
playing
a
restricted
game
of
with
his
sister
in
the
flat
it
was
really
a
forbidden
joy
owing
to
noise
and
risk
of
breakages
but
he
had
unusual
privileges
after
his
grave
illness
it
was
dusk
the
lamps
in
the
street
were
being
lit
quietly
remember
your
mother
resting
in
her
room
were
the
father
orders
she
had
just
returned
from
a
week
by
the
sea
recuperating
from
the
strain
of
nursing
for
so
many
nights
the
traffic
rolled
and
boomed
along
the
streets
below
jack
do
come
on
and
hide
it
your
turn
i
hid
last
but
the
boy
was
standing
spellbound
by
the
window
staring
hard
at
something
on
the
pavement
sybil
called
and
tugged
in
vain
tears
threatened
jack
would
not
budge
he
declared
he
saw
something
oh
you
always
seeing
something
i
wish
you
go
and
hide
only
because
you
ca
think
of
a
good
place
really
look
he
cried
in
a
voice
of
wonder
and
as
he
said
it
his
father
rose
quickly
from
his
chair
before
the
fire
look
the
child
repeated
with
delight
and
excitement
it
a
great
big
horse
and
it
perfectly
white
all
over
his
sister
joined
him
at
the
window
where
where
i
ca
see
it
oh
show
me
their
father
was
standing
close
behind
them
now
i
heard
it
he
was
whispering
but
so
low
the
children
did
not
notice
him
his
face
was
the
colour
of
chalk
straight
in
front
of
our
door
stupid
ca
you
see
it
oh
i
do
wish
it
had
come
for
me
it
a
beauty
and
he
clapped
his
hands
with
pleasure
and
excitement
quick
quick
it
going
away
again
but
while
the
children
stood
by
the
window
their
father
leaned
over
a
sofa
in
the
adjoining
room
above
a
figure
whose
heart
in
sleep
had
quietly
stopped
its
beating
the
great
white
horse
had
come
but
this
time
he
had
not
only
heard
its
wonderful
arrival
he
had
also
heard
it
go
it
seemed
he
heard
the
awful
hoofs
beat
down
the
sky
far
far
away
and
very
swiftly
dying
into
silence
finally
up
among
the
stars
