of

snow
and

stories

other
the
man
who
found
out
in
wolves

the
glamour
of
the

in
insanity

a
study
in
reincarnation
adventures
come
to
the
adventurous
and
mysterious
things
fall
in
the
way
of
those
who
with
wonder
and
imagination
are
on
the
watch
for
them
but
the
majority
of
people
go
past
the
doors
that
are
half
ajar
thinking
them
closed
and
fail
to
notice
the
faint
stirrings
of
the
great
curtain
that
hangs
ever
in
the
form
of
appearances
between
them
and
the
world
of
causes
behind
for
only
to
the
few
whose
inner
senses
have
been
quickened
perchance
by
some
strange
suffering
in
the
depths
or
by
a
natural
temperament
bequeathed
from
a
remote
past
comes
the
knowledge
not
too
welcome
that
this
greater
world
lies
ever
at
their
elbow
and
that
any
moment
a
chance
combination
of
moods
and
forces
may
invite
them
to
cross
the
shifting
frontier
some
however
are
born
with
this
awful
certainty
in
their
hearts
and
are
called
to
no
apprenticeship
and
to
this
select
company
jones
undoubtedly
belonged
all
his
life
he
had
realised
that
his
senses
brought
to
him
merely
a
more
or
less
interesting
set
of
sham
appearances
that
space
as
men
measure
it
was
utterly
misleading
that
time
as
the
clock
ticked
it
in
a
succession
of
minutes
was
arbitrary
nonsense
and
in
fact
that
all
his
sensory
perceptions
were
but
a
clumsy
representation
of
things
behind
the
curtain
things
he
was
for
ever
trying
to
get
at
and
that
sometimes
he
actually
did
get
at
he
had
always
been
tremblingly
aware
that
he
stood
on
the
borderland
of
another
region
a
region
where
time
and
space
were
merely
forms
of
thought
where
ancient
memories
lay
open
to
the
sight
and
where
the
forces
behind
each
human
life
stood
plainly
revealed
and
he
could
see
the
hidden
springs
at
the
very
heart
of
the
world
moreover
the
fact
that
he
was
a
clerk
in
a
fire
insurance
office
and
did
his
work
with
strict
attention
never
allowed
him
to
forget
for
one
moment
that
just
beyond
the
dingy
brick
walls
where
the
hundred
men
scribbled
with
pointed
pens
beneath
the
electric
lamps
there
existed
this
glorious
region
where
the
important
part
of
himself
dwelt
and
moved
and
had
its
being
for
in
this
region
he
pictured
himself
playing
the
part
of
a
spectator
to
his
ordinary
workaday
life
watching
like
a
king
the
stream
of
events
but
untouched
in
his
own
soul
by
the
dirt
the
noise
and
the
vulgar
commotion
of
the
outer
world
and
this
was
no
poetic
dream
merely
jones
was
not
playing
prettily
with
idealism
to
amuse
himself
it
was
a
living
working
belief
so
convinced
was
he
that
the
external
world
was
the
result
of
a
vast
deception
practised
upon
him
by
the
gross
senses
that
when
he
stared
at
a
great
building
like
paul
he
felt
it
would
not
very
much
surprise
him
to
see
it
suddenly
quiver
like
a
shape
of
jelly
and
then
melt
utterly
away
while
in
its
place
stood
all
at
once
revealed
the
mass
of
colour
or
the
great
intricate
vibrations
or
the
splendid
sound
the
spiritual
idea
which
it
represented
in
stone
for
something
in
this
way
it
was
that
his
mind
worked
yet
to
all
appearances
and
in
the
satisfaction
of
all
business
claims
jones
was
normal
and
unenterprising
he
felt
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
wave
of
modern
psychism
he
hardly
knew
the
meaning
of
such
words
as
clairvoyance
and
clairaudience
he
had
never
felt
the
least
desire
to
join
the
theosophical
society
and
to
speculate
in
theories
of
life
or
elementals
he
attended
no
meetings
of
the
psychical
research
society
and
knew
no
anxiety
as
to
whether
his
aura
was
black
or
blue
nor
was
he
conscious
of
the
slightest
wish
to
mix
in
with
the
revival
of
cheap
occultism
which
proves
so
attractive
to
weak
minds
of
mystical
tendencies
and
unleashed
imaginations
there
were
certain
things
he
but
none
he
cared
to
argue
about
and
he
shrank
instinctively
from
attempting
to
put
names
to
the
contents
of
this
other
region
knowing
well
that
such
names
could
only
limit
and
define
things
that
according
to
any
standards
in
use
in
the
ordinary
world
were
simply
undefinable
and
illusive
so
that
although
this
was
the
way
his
mind
worked
there
was
clearly
a
very
strong
leaven
of
common
sense
in
jones
in
a
word
the
man
the
world
and
the
office
knew
as
jones
jones
the
name
summed
him
up
and
labelled
him
correctly
john
enderby
jones
among
the
things
that
he
and
therefore
never
cared
to
speak
or
speculate
about
one
was
that
he
plainly
saw
himself
as
the
inheritor
of
a
long
series
of
past
lives
the
net
result
of
painful
evolution
always
as
himself
of
course
but
in
numerous
different
bodies
each
determined
by
the
behaviour
of
the
preceding
one
the
present
john
jones
was
the
last
result
to
date
of
all
the
previous
thinking
feeling
and
doing
of
john
jones
in
earlier
bodies
and
in
other
centuries
he
pretended
to
no
details
nor
claimed
distinguished
ancestry
for
he
realised
his
past
must
have
been
utterly
commonplace
and
insignificant
to
have
produced
his
present
but
he
was
just
as
sure
he
had
been
at
this
weary
game
for
ages
as
that
he
breathed
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
to
argue
to
doubt
or
to
ask
questions
and
one
result
of
this
belief
was
that
his
thoughts
dwelt
upon
the
past
rather
than
upon
the
future
that
he
read
much
history
and
felt
specially
drawn
to
certain
periods
whose
spirit
he
understood
instinctively
as
though
he
had
lived
in
them
and
that
he
found
all
religions
uninteresting
because
almost
without
exception
they
start
from
the
present
and
speculate
ahead
as
to
what
men
shall
become
instead
of
looking
back
and
speculating
why
men
have
got
here
as
they
are
in
the
insurance
office
he
did
his
work
exceedingly
well
but
without
much
personal
ambition
men
and
women
he
regarded
as
the
impersonal
instruments
for
inflicting
upon
him
the
pain
or
pleasure
he
had
earned
by
his
past
workings
for
chance
had
no
place
in
his
scheme
of
things
at
all
and
while
he
recognised
that
the
practical
world
could
not
get
along
unless
every
man
did
his
work
thoroughly
and
conscientiously
he
took
no
interest
in
the
accumulation
of
fame
or
money
for
himself
and
simply
therefore
did
his
plain
duty
with
indifference
as
to
results
in
common
with
others
who
lead
a
strictly
impersonal
life
he
possessed
the
quality
of
utter
bravery
and
was
always
ready
to
face
any
combination
of
circumstances
no
matter
how
terrible
because
he
saw
in
them
the
just
of
past
causes
he
had
himself
set
in
motion
which
could
not
be
dodged
or
modified
and
whereas
the
majority
of
people
had
little
meaning
for
him
either
by
way
of
attraction
or
repulsion
the
moment
he
met
some
one
with
whom
he
felt
his
past
had
been
interwoven
his
whole
inner
being
leapt
up
instantly
and
shouted
the
fact
in
his
face
and
he
regulated
his
life
with
the
utmost
skill
and
caution
like
a
sentry
on
watch
for
an
enemy
whose
feet
could
already
be
heard
approaching
thus
while
the
great
majority
of
men
and
women
left
him
uninfluenced
since
he
regarded
them
as
so
many
souls
merely
passing
with
him
along
the
great
stream
of
evolution
there
were
here
and
there
individuals
with
whom
he
recognised
that
his
smallest
intercourse
was
of
the
gravest
importance
these
were
persons
with
whom
he
knew
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
he
had
accounts
to
settle
pleasant
or
otherwise
arising
out
of
dealings
in
past
lives
and
into
his
relations
with
these
few
therefore
he
concentrated
as
it
were
the
efforts
that
most
people
spread
over
their
intercourse
with
a
far
greater
number
by
what
means
he
picked
out
these
few
individuals
only
those
conversant
with
the
startling
processes
of
the
subconscious
memory
may
say
but
the
point
was
that
jones
believed
the
main
purpose
if
not
quite
the
entire
purpose
of
his
present
incarnation
lay
in
his
faithful
and
thorough
settling
of
these
accounts
and
that
if
he
sought
to
evade
the
least
detail
of
such
settling
no
matter
how
unpleasant
he
would
have
lived
in
vain
and
would
return
to
his
next
incarnation
with
this
added
duty
to
perform
for
according
to
his
beliefs
there
was
no
chance
and
could
be
no
ultimate
shirking
and
to
avoid
a
problem
was
merely
to
waste
time
and
lose
opportunities
for
development
and
there
was
one
individual
with
whom
jones
had
long
understood
clearly
he
had
a
very
large
account
to
settle
and
towards
the
accomplishment
of
which
all
the
main
currents
of
his
being
seemed
to
bear
him
with
unswerving
purpose
for
when
he
first
entered
the
insurance
office
as
a
junior
clerk
ten
years
before
and
through
a
glass
door
had
caught
sight
of
this
man
seated
in
an
inner
room
one
of
his
sudden
overwhelming
flashes
of
intuitive
memory
had
burst
up
into
him
from
the
depths
and
he
had
seen
as
in
a
flame
of
blinding
light
a
symbolical
picture
of
the
future
rising
out
of
a
dreadful
past
and
he
had
without
any
act
of
definite
volition
marked
down
this
man
for
a
real
account
to
be
settled
with
man
i
shall
have
much
to
do
he
said
to
himself
as
he
noted
the
big
face
look
up
and
meet
his
eye
through
the
glass
there
is
something
i
can
not
shirk
a
vital
relation
out
of
the
past
of
both
of
us
and
he
went
to
his
desk
trembling
a
little
and
with
shaking
knees
as
though
the
memory
of
some
terrible
pain
had
suddenly
laid
its
icy
hand
upon
his
heart
and
touched
the
scar
of
a
great
horror
it
was
a
moment
of
genuine
terror
when
their
eyes
had
met
through
the
glass
door
and
he
was
conscious
of
an
inward
shrinking
and
loathing
that
seized
upon
him
with
great
violence
and
convinced
him
in
a
single
second
that
the
settling
of
this
account
would
be
almost
perhaps
more
than
he
could
manage
the
vision
passed
as
swiftly
as
it
came
dropping
back
again
into
the
submerged
region
of
his
consciousness
but
he
never
forgot
it
and
the
whole
of
his
life
thereafter
became
a
sort
of
natural
though
undeliberate
preparation
for
the
fulfilment
of
the
great
duty
when
the
time
should
be
ripe
in
those
days
ten
years
ago
this
man
was
the
assistant
manager
but
had
since
been
promoted
as
manager
to
one
of
the
company
local
branches
and
soon
afterwards
jones
had
likewise
found
himself
transferred
to
this
same
branch
a
little
later
again
the
branch
at
liverpool
one
of
the
most
important
had
been
in
peril
owing
to
mismanagement
and
defalcation
and
the
man
had
gone
to
take
charge
of
it
and
again
by
mere
chance
apparently
jones
had
been
promoted
to
the
same
place
and
this
pursuit
of
the
assistant
manager
had
continued
for
several
years
often
too
in
the
most
curious
fashion
and
though
jones
had
never
exchanged
a
single
word
with
him
or
been
so
much
as
noticed
indeed
by
the
great
man
the
clerk
understood
perfectly
well
that
these
moves
in
the
game
were
all
part
of
a
definite
purpose
never
for
one
moment
did
he
doubt
that
the
invisibles
behind
the
veil
were
slowly
and
surely
arranging
the
details
of
it
all
so
as
to
lead
up
suitably
to
the
climax
demanded
by
justice
a
climax
in
which
himself
and
the
manager
would
play
the
leading
it
is
inevitable
he
said
to
himself
and
i
feel
it
may
be
terrible
but
when
the
moment
comes
i
shall
be
ready
and
i
pray
god
that
i
may
face
it
properly
and
act
like
a
man
moreover
as
the
years
passed
and
nothing
happened
he
felt
the
horror
closing
in
upon
him
with
steady
increase
for
the
fact
was
jones
hated
and
loathed
the
manager
with
an
intensity
of
feeling
he
had
never
before
experienced
towards
any
human
being
he
shrank
from
his
presence
and
from
the
glance
of
his
eyes
as
though
he
remembered
to
have
suffered
nameless
cruelties
at
his
hands
and
he
slowly
began
to
realise
moreover
that
the
matter
to
be
settled
between
them
was
one
of
very
ancient
standing
and
that
the
nature
of
the
settlement
was
a
discharge
of
accumulated
punishment
which
would
probably
be
very
dreadful
in
the
manner
of
its
fulfilment
when
therefore
the
chief
cashier
one
day
informed
him
that
the
man
was
to
be
in
london
again
this
time
as
general
manager
of
the
head
office
and
said
that
he
was
charged
to
find
a
private
secretary
for
him
from
among
the
best
clerks
and
further
intimated
that
the
selection
had
fallen
upon
himself
jones
accepted
the
promotion
quietly
fatalistically
yet
with
a
degree
of
inward
loathing
hardly
to
be
described
for
he
saw
in
this
merely
another
move
in
the
evolution
of
the
inevitable
nemesis
which
he
simply
dared
not
seek
to
frustrate
by
any
personal
consideration
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
conscious
of
a
certain
feeling
of
relief
that
the
suspense
of
waiting
might
soon
be
mitigated
a
secret
sense
of
satisfaction
therefore
accompanied
the
unpleasant
change
and
jones
was
able
to
hold
himself
perfectly
well
in
hand
when
it
was
carried
into
effect
and
he
was
formally
introduced
as
private
secretary
to
the
general
manager
now
the
manager
was
a
large
fat
man
with
a
very
red
face
and
bags
beneath
his
eyes
being
he
wore
glasses
that
seemed
to
magnify
his
eyes
which
were
always
a
little
bloodshot
in
hot
weather
a
sort
of
thin
slime
covered
his
cheeks
for
he
perspired
easily
his
head
was
almost
entirely
bald
and
over
his
collar
his
great
neck
folded
in
two
distinct
reddish
collops
of
flesh
his
hands
were
big
and
his
fingers
almost
massive
in
thickness
he
was
an
excellent
business
man
of
sane
judgment
and
firm
will
without
enough
imagination
to
confuse
his
course
of
action
by
showing
him
possible
alternatives
and
his
integrity
and
ability
caused
him
to
be
held
in
universal
respect
by
the
world
of
business
and
finance
in
the
important
regions
of
a
man
character
however
and
at
heart
he
was
coarse
brutal
almost
to
savagery
without
consideration
for
others
and
as
a
result
often
cruelly
unjust
to
his
helpless
subordinates
in
moments
of
temper
which
were
not
infrequent
his
face
turned
a
dull
purple
while
the
top
of
his
bald
head
shone
by
contrast
like
white
marble
and
the
bags
under
his
eyes
swelled
till
it
seemed
they
would
presently
explode
with
a
pop
and
at
these
times
he
presented
a
distinctly
repulsive
appearance
but
to
a
private
secretary
like
jones
who
did
his
duty
regardless
of
whether
his
employer
was
beast
or
angel
and
whose
mainspring
was
principle
and
not
emotion
this
made
little
difference
within
the
narrow
limits
in
which
any
one
satisfy
such
a
man
he
pleased
the
general
manager
and
more
than
once
his
piercing
intuitive
faculty
amounting
almost
to
clairvoyance
assisted
the
chief
in
a
fashion
that
served
to
bring
the
two
closer
together
than
might
otherwise
have
been
the
case
and
caused
the
man
to
respect
in
his
assistant
a
power
of
which
he
possessed
not
even
the
germ
himself
it
was
a
curious
relationship
that
grew
up
between
the
two
and
the
cashier
who
enjoyed
the
credit
of
having
made
the
selection
profited
by
it
indirectly
as
much
as
any
one
else
so
for
some
time
the
work
of
the
office
continued
normally
and
very
prosperously
john
enderby
jones
received
a
good
salary
and
in
the
outward
appearance
of
the
two
chief
characters
in
this
history
there
was
little
change
noticeable
except
that
the
manager
grew
fatter
and
redder
and
the
secretary
observed
that
his
own
hair
was
beginning
to
show
rather
greyish
at
the
temples
there
were
however
two
changes
in
progress
and
they
both
had
to
do
with
jones
and
are
important
to
mention
one
was
that
he
began
to
dream
evilly
in
the
region
of
deep
sleep
where
the
possibility
of
significant
dreaming
first
develops
itself
he
was
tormented
more
and
more
with
vivid
scenes
and
pictures
in
which
a
tall
thin
man
dark
and
sinister
of
countenance
and
with
bad
eyes
was
closely
associated
with
himself
only
the
setting
was
that
of
a
past
age
with
costumes
of
centuries
gone
by
and
the
scenes
had
to
do
with
dreadful
cruelties
that
could
not
belong
to
modern
life
as
he
knew
it
the
other
change
was
also
significant
but
is
not
so
easy
to
describe
for
he
had
in
fact
become
aware
that
some
new
portion
of
himself
hitherto
unawakened
had
stirred
slowly
into
life
out
of
the
very
depths
of
his
consciousness
this
new
part
of
himself
amounted
almost
to
another
personality
and
he
never
observed
its
least
manifestation
without
a
strange
thrill
at
his
heart
for
he
understood
that
it
had
begun
to
the
manager
ii
it
was
the
habit
of
jones
since
he
was
compelled
to
work
among
conditions
that
were
utterly
distasteful
to
withdraw
his
mind
wholly
from
business
once
the
day
was
over
during
office
hours
he
kept
the
strictest
possible
watch
upon
himself
and
turned
the
key
on
all
inner
dreams
lest
any
sudden
uprush
from
the
deeps
should
interfere
with
his
duty
but
once
the
working
day
was
over
the
gates
flew
open
and
he
began
to
enjoy
himself
he
read
no
modern
books
on
the
subjects
that
interested
him
and
as
already
said
he
followed
no
course
of
training
nor
belonged
to
any
society
that
dabbled
with
mysteries
but
once
released
from
the
office
desk
in
the
manager
room
he
simply
and
naturally
entered
the
other
region
because
he
was
an
old
inhabitant
a
rightful
denizen
and
because
he
belonged
there
it
was
in
fact
really
a
case
of
dual
personality
and
a
carefully
drawn
agreement
existed
between
and
by
the
terms
of
which
under
heavy
penalties
neither
region
claimed
him
out
of
hours
for
the
moment
he
reached
his
rooms
under
the
roof
in
bloomsbury
and
had
changed
his
city
coat
to
another
the
iron
doors
of
the
office
clanged
far
behind
him
and
in
front
before
his
very
eyes
rolled
up
the
beautiful
gates
of
ivory
and
he
entered
into
the
places
of
flowers
and
singing
and
wonderful
veiled
forms
sometimes
he
quite
lost
touch
with
the
outer
world
forgetting
to
eat
his
dinner
or
go
to
bed
and
lay
in
a
state
of
trance
his
consciousness
working
far
out
of
the
body
and
on
other
occasions
he
walked
the
streets
on
air
between
the
two
regions
unable
to
distinguish
between
incarnate
and
discarnate
forms
and
not
very
far
probably
beyond
the
strata
where
poets
saints
and
the
greatest
artists
have
moved
and
thought
and
found
their
inspiration
but
this
was
only
when
some
insistent
bodily
claim
prevented
his
full
release
and
more
often
than
not
he
was
entirely
independent
of
his
physical
portion
and
free
of
the
real
region
without
let
or
hindrance
one
evening
he
reached
home
utterly
exhausted
after
the
burden
of
the
day
work
the
manager
had
been
more
than
usually
brutal
unjust
and
jones
had
been
almost
persuaded
out
of
his
settled
policy
of
contempt
into
answering
back
everything
seemed
to
have
gone
amiss
and
the
man
coarse
underbred
nature
had
been
in
the
ascendant
all
day
long
he
had
thumped
the
desk
with
his
great
fists
abused
found
fault
unreasonably
uttered
outrageous
things
and
behaved
generally
as
he
actually
was
beneath
the
thin
veneer
of
acquired
business
varnish
he
had
done
and
said
everything
to
wound
all
that
was
woundable
in
an
ordinary
secretary
and
though
jones
fortunately
dwelt
in
a
region
from
which
he
looked
down
upon
such
a
man
as
he
might
look
down
on
the
blundering
of
a
savage
animal
the
strain
had
nevertheless
told
severely
upon
him
and
he
reached
home
wondering
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
whether
there
was
perhaps
a
point
beyond
which
he
would
be
unable
to
restrain
himself
any
longer
for
something
out
of
the
usual
had
happened
at
the
close
of
a
passage
of
great
stress
between
the
two
every
nerve
in
the
secretary
body
tingling
from
undeserved
abuse
the
manager
had
suddenly
turned
full
upon
him
in
the
corner
of
the
private
room
where
the
safes
stood
in
such
a
way
that
the
glare
of
his
red
eyes
magnified
by
the
glasses
looked
straight
into
his
own
and
at
this
very
second
that
other
personality
in
jones
the
one
that
was
ever
rose
up
swiftly
from
the
deeps
within
and
held
a
mirror
to
his
face
a
moment
of
flame
and
vision
rushed
over
him
and
for
one
single
second
one
merciless
second
of
clear
sight
he
saw
the
manager
as
the
tall
dark
man
of
his
evil
dreams
and
the
knowledge
that
he
had
suffered
at
his
hands
some
awful
injury
in
the
past
crashed
through
his
mind
like
the
report
of
a
cannon
it
all
flashed
upon
him
and
was
gone
changing
him
from
fire
to
ice
and
then
back
again
to
fire
and
he
left
the
office
with
the
certain
conviction
in
his
heart
that
the
time
for
his
final
settlement
with
the
man
the
time
for
the
inevitable
retribution
was
at
last
drawing
very
near
according
to
his
invariable
custom
however
he
succeeded
in
putting
the
memory
of
all
this
unpleasantness
out
of
his
mind
with
the
changing
of
his
office
coat
and
after
dozing
a
little
in
his
leather
chair
before
the
fire
he
started
out
as
usual
for
dinner
in
the
soho
french
restaurant
and
began
to
dream
himself
away
into
the
region
of
flowers
and
singing
and
to
commune
with
the
invisibles
that
were
the
very
sources
of
his
real
life
and
being
for
it
was
in
this
way
that
his
mind
worked
and
the
habits
of
years
had
crystallised
into
rigid
lines
along
which
it
was
now
necessary
and
inevitable
for
him
to
act
at
the
door
of
the
little
restaurant
he
stopped
short
a
appointment
in
his
mind
he
had
made
an
engagement
with
some
one
but
where
or
with
whom
had
entirely
slipped
his
memory
he
thought
it
was
for
dinner
or
else
to
meet
just
after
dinner
and
for
a
second
it
came
back
to
him
that
it
had
something
to
do
with
the
office
but
whatever
it
was
he
was
quite
unable
to
recall
it
and
a
reference
to
his
pocket
engagement
book
showed
only
a
blank
page
evidently
he
had
even
omitted
to
enter
it
and
after
standing
a
moment
vainly
trying
to
recall
either
the
time
place
or
person
he
went
in
and
sat
down
but
though
the
details
had
escaped
him
his
subconscious
memory
seemed
to
know
all
about
it
for
he
experienced
a
sudden
sinking
of
the
heart
accompanied
by
a
sense
of
foreboding
anticipation
and
felt
that
beneath
his
exhaustion
there
lay
a
centre
of
tremendous
excitement
the
emotion
caused
by
the
engagement
was
at
work
and
would
presently
cause
the
actual
details
of
the
appointment
to
reappear
inside
the
restaurant
the
feeling
increased
instead
of
passing
some
one
was
waiting
for
him
somewhere
some
one
whom
he
had
definitely
arranged
to
meet
he
was
expected
by
a
person
that
very
night
and
just
about
that
very
time
but
by
whom
where
a
curious
inner
trembling
came
over
him
and
he
made
a
strong
effort
to
hold
himself
in
hand
and
to
be
ready
for
anything
that
might
come
and
then
suddenly
came
the
knowledge
that
the
place
of
appointment
was
this
very
restaurant
and
further
that
the
person
he
had
promised
to
meet
was
already
here
waiting
somewhere
quite
close
beside
him
he
looked
up
nervously
and
began
to
examine
the
faces
round
him
the
majority
of
the
diners
were
frenchmen
chattering
loudly
with
much
gesticulation
and
laughter
and
there
was
a
fair
sprinkling
of
clerks
like
himself
who
came
because
the
prices
were
low
and
the
food
good
but
there
was
no
single
face
that
he
recognised
until
his
glance
fell
upon
the
occupant
of
the
corner
seat
opposite
generally
filled
by
himself
there
the
man
who
waiting
for
me
thought
jones
instantly
he
knew
it
at
once
the
man
he
saw
was
sitting
well
back
into
the
corner
with
a
thick
overcoat
buttoned
tightly
up
to
the
chin
his
skin
was
very
white
and
a
heavy
black
beard
grew
far
up
over
his
cheeks
at
first
the
secretary
took
him
for
a
stranger
but
when
he
looked
up
and
their
eyes
met
a
sense
of
familiarity
flashed
across
him
and
for
a
second
or
two
jones
imagined
he
was
staring
at
a
man
he
had
known
years
before
for
barring
the
beard
it
was
the
face
of
an
elderly
clerk
who
had
occupied
the
next
desk
to
his
own
when
he
first
entered
the
service
of
the
insurance
company
and
had
shown
him
the
most
painstaking
kindness
and
sympathy
in
the
early
difficulties
of
his
work
but
a
moment
later
the
illusion
passed
for
he
remembered
that
thorpe
had
been
dead
at
least
five
years
the
similarity
of
the
eyes
was
obviously
a
mere
suggestive
trick
of
memory
the
two
men
stared
at
one
another
for
several
seconds
and
then
jones
began
to
act
and
because
he
had
to
he
crossed
over
and
took
the
vacant
seat
at
the
other
table
facing
him
for
he
felt
it
was
somehow
imperative
to
explain
why
he
was
late
and
how
it
was
he
had
almost
forgotten
the
engagement
altogether
no
honest
excuse
however
came
to
his
assistance
though
his
mind
had
begun
to
work
furiously
yes
you
late
said
the
man
quietly
before
he
could
find
a
single
word
to
utter
but
it
does
matter
also
you
had
forgotten
the
appointment
but
that
makes
no
difference
either
i
knew
that
there
was
an
engagement
jones
stammered
passing
his
hand
over
his
forehead
but
somehow
you
will
recall
it
presently
continued
the
other
in
a
gentle
voice
and
smiling
a
little
it
was
in
deep
sleep
last
night
we
arranged
this
and
the
unpleasant
occurrences
of
have
for
the
moment
obliterated
it
a
faint
memory
stirred
within
him
as
the
man
spoke
and
a
grove
of
trees
with
moving
forms
hovered
before
his
eyes
and
then
vanished
again
while
for
an
instant
the
stranger
seemed
to
be
capable
of
and
to
have
assumed
vast
proportions
with
wonderful
flaming
eyes
oh
he
gasped
it
was
there
in
the
other
region
of
course
said
the
other
with
a
smile
that
illumined
his
whole
face
you
will
remember
presently
all
in
good
time
and
meanwhile
you
have
no
cause
to
feel
afraid
there
was
a
wonderful
soothing
quality
in
the
man
voice
like
the
whispering
of
a
great
wind
and
the
clerk
felt
calmer
at
once
they
sat
a
little
while
longer
but
he
could
not
remember
that
they
talked
much
or
ate
anything
he
only
recalled
afterwards
that
the
head
waiter
came
up
and
whispered
something
in
his
ear
and
that
he
glanced
round
and
saw
the
other
people
were
looking
at
him
curiously
some
of
them
laughing
and
that
his
companion
then
got
up
and
led
the
way
out
of
the
restaurant
they
walked
hurriedly
through
the
streets
neither
of
them
speaking
and
jones
was
so
intent
upon
getting
back
the
whole
history
of
the
affair
from
the
region
of
deep
sleep
that
he
barely
noticed
the
way
they
took
yet
it
was
clear
he
knew
where
they
were
bound
for
just
as
well
as
his
companion
for
he
crossed
the
streets
often
ahead
of
him
diving
down
alleys
without
hesitation
and
the
other
followed
always
without
correction
the
pavements
were
very
full
and
the
usual
night
crowds
of
london
were
surging
to
and
fro
in
the
glare
of
the
shop
lights
but
somehow
no
one
impeded
their
rapid
movements
and
they
seemed
to
pass
through
the
people
as
if
they
were
smoke
and
as
they
went
the
pedestrians
and
traffic
grew
less
and
less
and
they
soon
passed
the
mansion
house
and
the
deserted
space
in
front
of
the
royal
exchange
and
so
on
down
fenchurch
street
and
within
sight
of
the
tower
of
london
rising
dim
and
shadowy
in
the
smoky
air
jones
remembered
all
this
perfectly
well
and
thought
it
was
his
intense
preoccupation
that
made
the
distance
seem
so
short
but
it
was
when
the
tower
was
left
behind
and
they
turned
northwards
that
he
began
to
notice
how
altered
everything
was
and
saw
that
they
were
in
a
neighbourhood
where
houses
were
suddenly
scarce
and
lanes
and
fields
beginning
and
that
their
only
light
was
the
stars
overhead
and
as
the
deeper
consciousness
more
and
more
asserted
itself
to
the
exclusion
of
the
surface
happenings
of
his
mere
body
during
the
day
the
sense
of
exhaustion
vanished
and
he
realised
that
he
was
moving
somewhere
in
the
region
of
causes
behind
the
veil
beyond
the
gross
deceptions
of
the
senses
and
released
from
the
clumsy
spell
of
space
and
time
without
great
surprise
therefore
he
turned
and
saw
that
his
companion
had
altered
had
shed
his
overcoat
and
black
hat
and
was
moving
beside
him
absolutely
for
a
brief
second
he
saw
him
tall
as
a
tree
extending
through
space
like
a
great
shadow
misty
and
wavering
of
outline
followed
by
a
sound
like
wings
in
the
darkness
but
when
he
stopped
fear
clutching
at
his
heart
the
other
resumed
his
former
proportions
and
jones
could
plainly
see
his
normal
outline
against
the
green
field
behind
then
the
secretary
saw
him
fumbling
at
his
neck
and
at
the
same
moment
the
black
beard
came
away
from
the
face
in
his
hand
then
you
thorpe
he
gasped
yet
somehow
without
overwhelming
surprise
they
stood
facing
one
another
in
the
lonely
lane
trees
meeting
overhead
and
hiding
the
stars
and
a
sound
of
mournful
sighing
among
the
branches
i
am
thorpe
was
the
answer
in
a
voice
that
almost
seemed
part
of
the
wind
and
i
have
come
out
of
our
far
past
to
help
you
for
my
debt
to
you
is
large
and
in
this
life
i
had
but
small
opportunity
to
repay
jones
thought
quickly
of
the
man
kindness
to
him
in
the
office
and
a
great
wave
of
feeling
surged
through
him
as
he
began
to
remember
dimly
the
friend
by
whose
side
he
had
already
climbed
perhaps
through
vast
ages
of
his
soul
evolution
to
help
me
he
whispered
you
will
understand
me
when
you
enter
into
your
real
memory
and
recall
how
great
a
debt
i
have
to
pay
for
old
faithful
kindnesses
of
long
ago
sighed
the
other
in
a
voice
like
falling
wind
between
us
though
there
can
be
no
question
of
jones
heard
himself
saying
and
remembered
the
reply
that
floated
to
him
on
the
air
and
the
smile
that
lightened
for
a
moment
the
stern
eyes
facing
him
not
of
debt
indeed
but
of
privilege
jones
felt
his
heart
leap
out
towards
this
man
this
old
friend
tried
by
centuries
and
still
faithful
he
made
a
movement
to
seize
his
hand
but
the
other
shifted
like
a
thing
of
mist
and
for
a
moment
the
head
swam
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
fail
then
you
are
he
said
under
his
breath
with
a
slight
shiver
five
years
ago
i
left
the
body
you
knew
replied
thorpe
i
tried
to
help
you
then
instinctively
not
fully
recognising
you
but
now
i
can
accomplish
far
more
with
an
awful
sense
of
foreboding
and
dread
in
his
heart
the
secretary
was
beginning
to
understand
it
has
to
do
with
with
your
past
dealings
with
the
manager
came
the
answer
as
the
wind
rose
louder
among
the
branches
overhead
and
carried
off
the
remainder
of
the
sentence
into
the
air
jones
memory
which
was
just
beginning
to
stir
among
the
deepest
layers
of
all
shut
down
suddenly
with
a
snap
and
he
followed
his
companion
over
fields
and
down
lanes
where
the
air
was
fragrant
and
cool
till
they
came
to
a
large
house
standing
gaunt
and
lonely
in
the
shadows
at
the
edge
of
a
wood
it
was
wrapped
in
utter
stillness
with
windows
heavily
draped
in
black
and
the
clerk
as
he
looked
felt
such
an
overpowering
wave
of
sadness
invade
him
that
his
eyes
began
to
burn
and
smart
and
he
was
conscious
of
a
desire
to
shed
tears
the
key
made
a
harsh
noise
as
it
turned
in
the
lock
and
when
the
door
swung
open
into
a
lofty
hall
they
heard
a
confused
sound
of
rustling
and
whispering
as
of
a
great
throng
of
people
pressing
forward
to
meet
them
the
air
seemed
full
of
swaying
movement
and
jones
was
certain
he
saw
hands
held
aloft
and
dim
faces
claiming
recognition
while
in
his
heart
already
oppressed
by
the
approaching
burden
of
vast
accumulated
memories
he
was
aware
of
the
of
that
had
been
asleep
for
ages
as
they
advanced
he
heard
the
doors
close
with
a
muffled
thunder
behind
them
and
saw
that
the
shadows
seemed
to
retreat
and
shrink
away
towards
the
interior
of
the
house
carrying
the
hands
and
faces
with
them
he
heard
the
wind
singing
round
the
walls
and
over
the
roof
and
its
wailing
voice
mingled
with
the
sound
of
deep
collective
breathing
that
filled
the
house
like
the
murmur
of
a
sea
and
as
they
walked
up
the
broad
staircase
and
through
the
vaulted
rooms
where
pillars
rose
like
the
stems
of
trees
he
knew
that
the
building
was
crowded
row
upon
row
with
the
thronging
memories
of
his
own
long
past
this
is
the
of
the
whispered
thorpe
beside
him
as
they
moved
silently
from
room
to
room
the
house
of
past
it
is
full
from
cellar
to
roof
with
the
memories
of
what
you
have
done
thought
and
felt
from
the
earliest
stages
of
your
evolution
until
now
the
house
climbs
up
almost
to
the
clouds
and
stretches
back
into
the
heart
of
the
wood
you
saw
outside
but
the
remoter
halls
are
filled
with
the
ghosts
of
ages
ago
too
many
to
count
and
even
if
we
were
able
to
waken
them
you
could
not
remember
them
now
some
day
though
they
will
come
and
claim
you
and
you
must
know
them
and
answer
their
questions
for
they
can
never
rest
till
they
have
exhausted
themselves
again
through
you
and
justice
has
been
perfectly
worked
out
but
now
follow
me
closely
and
you
shall
see
the
particular
memory
for
which
i
am
permitted
to
be
your
guide
so
that
you
may
know
and
understand
a
great
force
in
your
present
life
and
may
use
the
sword
of
justice
or
rise
to
the
level
of
a
great
forgiveness
according
to
your
degree
of
power
icy
thrills
ran
through
the
trembling
clerk
and
as
he
walked
slowly
beside
his
companion
he
heard
from
the
vaults
below
as
well
as
from
more
distant
regions
of
the
vast
building
the
stirring
and
sighing
of
the
serried
ranks
of
sleepers
sounding
in
the
still
air
like
a
chord
swept
from
unseen
strings
stretched
somewhere
among
the
very
foundations
of
the
house
stealthily
picking
their
way
among
the
great
pillars
they
moved
up
the
sweeping
staircase
and
through
several
dark
corridors
and
halls
and
presently
stopped
outside
a
small
door
in
an
archway
where
the
shadows
were
very
deep
remain
close
by
my
side
and
remember
to
utter
no
cry
whispered
the
voice
of
his
guide
and
as
the
clerk
turned
to
reply
he
saw
his
face
was
stern
to
whiteness
and
even
shone
a
little
in
the
darkness
the
room
they
entered
seemed
at
first
to
be
pitchy
black
but
gradually
the
secretary
perceived
a
faint
reddish
glow
against
the
farther
end
and
thought
he
saw
figures
moving
silently
to
and
fro
now
watch
whispered
thorpe
as
they
pressed
close
to
the
wall
near
the
door
and
waited
but
remember
to
keep
absolute
silence
it
is
a
torture
scene
jones
felt
utterly
afraid
and
would
have
turned
to
fly
if
he
dared
for
an
indescribable
terror
seized
him
and
his
knees
shook
but
some
power
that
made
escape
impossible
held
him
remorselessly
there
and
with
eyes
glued
on
the
spots
of
light
he
crouched
against
the
wall
and
waited
the
figures
began
to
move
more
swiftly
each
in
its
own
dim
light
that
shed
no
radiance
beyond
itself
and
he
heard
a
soft
clanking
of
chains
and
the
voice
of
a
man
groaning
in
pain
then
came
the
sound
of
a
door
closing
and
thereafter
jones
saw
but
one
figure
the
figure
of
an
old
man
naked
entirely
and
fastened
with
chains
to
an
iron
framework
on
the
floor
his
memory
gave
a
sudden
leap
of
fear
as
he
looked
for
the
features
and
white
beard
were
familiar
and
he
recalled
them
as
though
of
yesterday
the
other
figures
had
disappeared
and
the
old
man
became
the
centre
of
the
terrible
picture
slowly
with
ghastly
groans
as
the
heat
below
him
increased
into
a
steady
glow
the
aged
body
rose
in
a
curve
of
agony
resting
on
the
iron
frame
only
where
the
chains
held
wrists
and
ankles
fast
cries
and
gasps
filled
the
air
and
jones
felt
exactly
as
though
they
came
from
his
own
throat
and
as
if
the
chains
were
burning
into
his
own
wrists
and
ankles
and
the
heat
scorching
the
skin
and
flesh
upon
his
own
back
he
began
to
writhe
and
twist
himself
spain
whispered
the
voice
at
his
side
and
four
hundred
years
ago
and
the
purpose
gasped
the
perspiring
clerk
though
he
knew
quite
well
what
the
answer
must
be
to
extort
the
name
of
a
friend
to
his
death
and
betrayal
came
the
reply
through
the
darkness
a
sliding
panel
opened
with
a
little
rattle
in
the
wall
immediately
above
the
rack
and
a
face
framed
in
the
same
red
glow
appeared
and
looked
down
upon
the
dying
victim
jones
was
only
just
able
to
choke
a
scream
for
he
recognised
the
tall
dark
man
of
his
dreams
with
horrible
gloating
eyes
he
gazed
down
upon
the
writhing
form
of
the
old
man
and
his
lips
moved
as
in
speaking
though
no
words
were
actually
audible
he
asks
again
for
the
name
explained
the
other
as
the
clerk
struggled
with
the
intense
hatred
and
loathing
that
threatened
every
moment
to
result
in
screams
and
action
his
ankles
and
wrists
pained
him
so
that
he
could
scarcely
keep
still
but
a
merciless
power
held
him
to
the
scene
he
saw
the
old
man
with
a
fierce
cry
raise
his
tortured
head
and
spit
up
into
the
face
at
the
panel
and
then
the
shutter
slid
back
again
and
a
moment
later
the
increased
glow
beneath
the
body
accompanied
by
awful
writhing
told
of
the
application
of
further
heat
there
came
the
odour
of
burning
flesh
the
white
beard
curled
and
burned
to
a
crisp
the
body
fell
back
limp
upon
the
iron
and
then
shot
up
again
in
fresh
agony
cry
after
cry
the
most
awful
in
the
world
rang
out
with
deadened
sound
between
the
four
walls
and
again
the
panel
slid
back
creaking
and
revealed
the
dreadful
face
of
the
torturer
again
the
name
was
asked
for
and
again
it
was
refused
and
this
time
after
the
closing
of
the
panel
a
door
opened
and
the
tall
thin
man
with
the
evil
face
came
slowly
into
the
chamber
his
features
were
savage
with
rage
and
disappointment
and
in
the
dull
red
glow
that
fell
upon
them
he
looked
like
a
very
prince
of
devils
in
his
hand
he
held
a
pointed
iron
at
white
heat
now
the
murder
came
from
thorpe
in
a
whisper
that
sounded
as
if
it
was
outside
the
building
and
far
away
jones
knew
quite
well
what
was
coming
but
was
unable
even
to
close
his
eyes
he
felt
all
the
fearful
pains
himself
just
as
though
he
were
actually
the
sufferer
but
now
as
he
stared
he
felt
something
more
besides
and
when
the
tall
man
deliberately
approached
the
rack
and
plunged
the
heated
iron
first
into
one
eye
and
then
into
the
other
he
heard
the
faint
fizzing
of
it
and
felt
his
own
eyes
burst
in
frightful
pain
from
his
head
at
the
same
moment
unable
longer
to
control
himself
he
uttered
a
wild
shriek
and
dashed
forward
to
seize
the
torturer
and
tear
him
to
a
thousand
pieces
instantly
in
a
flash
the
entire
scene
vanished
darkness
rushed
in
to
fill
the
room
and
he
felt
himself
lifted
off
his
feet
by
some
force
like
a
great
wind
and
borne
swiftly
away
into
space
when
he
recovered
his
senses
he
was
standing
just
outside
the
house
and
the
figure
of
thorpe
was
beside
him
in
the
gloom
the
great
doors
were
in
the
act
of
closing
behind
him
but
before
they
shut
he
fancied
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
an
immense
veiled
figure
standing
upon
the
threshold
with
flaming
eyes
and
in
his
hand
a
bright
weapon
like
a
shining
sword
of
fire
come
quickly
now
all
is
over
thorpe
whispered
and
the
dark
man
gasped
the
clerk
as
he
moved
swiftly
by
the
other
side
in
this
present
life
is
the
manager
of
the
company
and
the
victim
was
yourself
and
the
friend
he
refused
to
betray
i
was
that
friend
answered
thorpe
his
voice
with
every
moment
sounding
more
and
more
like
the
cry
of
the
wind
you
gave
your
life
in
agony
to
save
mine
and
again
in
this
life
we
have
all
three
been
together
yes
such
forces
are
not
soon
or
easily
exhausted
and
justice
is
not
satisfied
till
all
have
reaped
what
they
sowed
jones
had
an
odd
feeling
that
he
was
slipping
away
into
some
other
state
of
consciousness
thorpe
began
to
seem
unreal
presently
he
would
be
unable
to
ask
more
questions
he
felt
utterly
sick
and
faint
with
it
all
and
his
strength
was
ebbing
oh
quick
he
cried
now
tell
me
more
why
did
i
see
this
what
must
i
do
the
wind
swept
across
the
field
on
their
right
and
entered
the
wood
beyond
with
a
great
roar
and
the
air
round
him
seemed
filled
with
voices
and
the
rushing
of
hurried
movement
to
the
ends
of
justice
answered
the
other
as
though
speaking
out
of
the
centre
of
the
wind
and
from
a
distance
which
sometimes
is
entrusted
to
the
hands
of
those
who
suffered
and
were
strong
one
wrong
can
not
be
put
right
by
another
wrong
but
your
life
has
been
so
worthy
that
the
opportunity
is
given
to
the
voice
grew
fainter
and
fainter
already
it
was
far
overhead
with
the
rushing
wind
you
may
punish
or
here
jones
lost
sight
of
thorpe
figure
altogether
for
he
seemed
to
have
vanished
and
melted
away
into
the
wood
behind
him
his
voice
sounded
far
across
the
trees
very
weak
and
ever
rising
or
if
you
can
rise
to
the
level
of
a
great
forgiveness
the
voice
became
inaudible
the
wind
came
crying
out
of
the
wood
again
jones
shivered
and
stared
about
him
he
shook
himself
violently
and
rubbed
his
eyes
the
room
was
dark
the
fire
was
out
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
he
got
up
out
of
his
armchair
still
trembling
and
lit
the
gas
outside
the
wind
was
howling
and
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
he
saw
that
it
was
very
late
and
he
must
go
to
bed
he
had
not
even
changed
his
office
coat
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
in
the
chair
as
soon
as
he
came
in
and
he
had
slept
for
several
hours
certainly
he
had
eaten
no
dinner
for
he
felt
ravenous
iii
next
day
and
for
several
weeks
thereafter
the
business
of
the
office
went
on
as
usual
and
jones
did
his
work
well
and
behaved
outwardly
with
perfect
propriety
no
more
visions
troubled
him
and
his
relations
with
the
manager
became
if
anything
somewhat
smoother
and
easier
true
the
man
a
little
different
because
the
clerk
kept
seeing
him
with
his
inner
and
outer
eye
promiscuously
so
that
one
moment
he
was
broad
and
and
the
next
he
was
tall
thin
and
dark
enveloped
as
it
were
in
a
sort
of
black
atmosphere
tinged
with
red
while
at
times
a
confusion
of
the
two
sights
took
place
and
jones
saw
the
two
faces
mingled
in
a
composite
countenance
that
was
very
horrible
indeed
to
contemplate
but
beyond
this
occasional
change
in
the
outward
appearance
of
the
manager
there
was
nothing
that
the
secretary
noticed
as
the
result
of
his
vision
and
business
went
on
more
or
less
as
before
and
perhaps
even
with
a
little
less
friction
but
in
the
rooms
under
the
roof
in
bloomsbury
it
was
different
for
there
it
was
perfectly
clear
to
jones
that
thorpe
had
come
to
take
up
his
abode
with
him
he
never
saw
him
but
he
knew
all
the
time
he
was
there
every
night
on
returning
from
his
work
he
was
greeted
by
the
whisper
be
ready
when
i
give
the
sign
and
often
in
the
night
he
woke
up
suddenly
out
of
deep
sleep
and
was
aware
that
thorpe
had
that
minute
moved
away
from
his
bed
and
was
standing
waiting
and
watching
somewhere
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
often
he
followed
him
down
the
stairs
though
the
dim
gas
jet
on
the
landings
never
revealed
his
outline
and
sometimes
he
did
not
come
into
the
room
at
all
but
hovered
outside
the
window
peering
through
the
dirty
panes
or
sending
his
whisper
into
the
chamber
in
the
whistling
of
the
wind
for
thorpe
had
come
to
stay
and
jones
knew
that
he
would
not
get
rid
of
him
until
he
had
fulfilled
the
ends
of
justice
and
accomplished
the
purpose
for
which
he
was
waiting
meanwhile
as
the
days
passed
he
went
through
a
tremendous
struggle
with
himself
and
came
to
the
perfectly
honest
decision
that
the
level
of
a
great
forgiveness
was
impossible
for
him
and
that
he
must
therefore
accept
the
alternative
and
use
the
secret
knowledge
placed
in
his
hands
and
execute
justice
and
once
this
decision
was
arrived
at
he
noticed
that
thorpe
no
longer
left
him
alone
during
the
day
as
before
but
now
accompanied
him
to
the
office
and
stayed
more
or
less
at
his
side
all
through
business
hours
as
well
his
whisper
made
itself
heard
in
the
streets
and
in
the
train
and
even
in
the
manager
room
where
he
worked
sometimes
warning
sometimes
urging
but
never
for
a
moment
suggesting
the
abandonment
of
the
main
purpose
and
more
than
once
so
plainly
audible
that
the
clerk
felt
certain
others
must
have
heard
it
as
well
as
himself
the
obsession
was
complete
he
felt
he
was
always
under
thorpe
eye
day
and
night
and
he
knew
he
must
acquit
himself
like
a
man
when
the
moment
came
or
prove
a
failure
in
his
own
sight
as
well
in
the
sight
of
the
other
and
now
that
his
mind
was
made
up
nothing
could
prevent
the
carrying
out
of
the
sentence
he
bought
a
pistol
and
spent
his
saturday
afternoons
practising
at
a
target
in
lonely
places
along
the
essex
shore
marking
out
in
the
sand
the
exact
measurements
of
the
room
sundays
he
occupied
in
like
fashion
putting
up
at
an
inn
overnight
for
the
purpose
spending
the
money
that
usually
went
into
the
savings
bank
on
travelling
expenses
and
cartridges
everything
was
done
very
thoroughly
for
there
must
be
no
possibility
of
failure
and
at
the
end
of
several
weeks
he
had
become
so
expert
with
his
that
at
a
distance
of
feet
which
was
the
greatest
length
of
the
room
he
could
pick
the
inside
out
of
a
halfpenny
nine
times
out
of
a
dozen
and
leave
a
clean
unbroken
rim
there
was
not
the
slightest
desire
to
delay
he
had
thought
the
matter
over
from
every
point
of
view
his
mind
could
reach
and
his
purpose
was
inflexible
indeed
he
felt
proud
to
think
that
he
had
been
chosen
as
the
instrument
of
justice
in
the
infliction
of
so
and
so
terrible
a
punishment
vengeance
may
have
had
some
part
in
his
decision
but
he
could
not
help
that
for
he
still
felt
at
times
the
hot
chains
burning
his
wrists
and
ankles
with
fierce
agony
through
to
the
bone
he
remembered
the
hideous
pain
of
his
slowly
roasting
back
and
the
point
when
he
thought
death
intervene
to
end
his
suffering
but
instead
new
powers
of
endurance
had
surged
up
in
him
and
awful
further
stretches
of
pain
had
opened
up
and
unconsciousness
seemed
farther
off
than
ever
then
at
last
the
hot
irons
in
his
eyes
it
all
came
back
to
him
and
caused
him
to
break
out
in
icy
perspiration
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
the
vile
face
at
the
panel
the
expression
of
the
dark
face
his
fingers
worked
his
blood
boiled
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
keep
the
idea
of
vengeance
altogether
out
of
his
mind
several
times
he
was
temporarily
baulked
of
his
prey
odd
things
happened
to
stop
him
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
action
the
first
day
for
instance
the
manager
fainted
from
the
heat
another
time
when
he
had
decided
to
do
the
deed
the
manager
did
not
come
down
to
the
office
at
all
and
a
third
time
when
his
hand
was
actually
in
his
hip
pocket
he
suddenly
heard
thorpe
horrid
whisper
telling
him
to
wait
and
turning
he
saw
that
the
head
cashier
had
entered
the
room
noiselessly
without
his
noticing
it
thorpe
evidently
knew
what
he
was
about
and
did
not
intend
to
let
the
clerk
bungle
the
matter
he
fancied
moreover
that
the
head
cashier
was
watching
him
he
was
always
meeting
him
in
unexpected
corners
and
places
and
the
cashier
never
seemed
to
have
an
adequate
excuse
for
being
there
his
movements
seemed
suddenly
of
particular
interest
to
others
in
the
office
as
well
for
clerks
were
always
being
sent
to
ask
him
unnecessary
questions
and
there
was
apparently
a
general
design
to
keep
him
under
a
sort
of
surveillance
so
that
he
was
never
much
alone
with
the
manager
in
the
private
room
where
they
worked
and
once
the
cashier
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
he
could
take
his
holiday
earlier
than
usual
if
he
liked
as
the
work
had
been
very
arduous
of
late
and
the
heat
exceedingly
trying
he
noticed
too
that
he
was
sometimes
followed
by
a
certain
individual
in
the
streets
a
sort
of
man
who
never
came
face
to
face
with
him
or
actually
ran
into
him
but
who
was
always
in
his
train
or
omnibus
and
whose
eye
he
often
caught
observing
him
over
the
top
of
his
newspaper
and
who
on
one
occasion
was
even
waiting
at
the
door
of
his
lodgings
when
he
came
out
to
dine
there
were
other
indications
too
of
various
sorts
that
led
him
to
think
something
was
at
work
to
defeat
his
purpose
and
that
he
must
act
at
once
before
these
hostile
forces
could
prevent
and
so
the
end
came
very
swiftly
and
was
thoroughly
approved
by
thorpe
it
was
towards
the
close
of
july
and
one
of
the
hottest
days
london
had
ever
known
for
the
city
was
like
an
oven
and
the
particles
of
dust
seemed
to
burn
the
throats
of
the
unfortunate
toilers
in
street
and
office
the
portly
manager
who
suffered
cruelly
owing
to
his
size
came
down
perspiring
and
gasping
with
the
heat
he
carried
a
umbrella
to
protect
his
head
he
want
something
more
than
that
though
jones
laughed
quietly
to
himself
when
he
saw
him
enter
the
pistol
was
safely
in
his
hip
pocket
every
one
of
its
six
chambers
loaded
the
manager
saw
the
smile
on
his
face
and
gave
him
a
long
steady
look
as
he
sat
down
to
his
desk
in
the
corner
a
few
minutes
later
he
touched
the
bell
for
the
head
cashier
a
single
ring
and
then
asked
jones
to
fetch
some
papers
from
another
safe
in
the
room
upstairs
a
deep
inner
trembling
seized
the
secretary
as
he
noticed
these
precautions
for
he
saw
that
the
hostile
forces
were
at
work
against
him
and
yet
he
felt
he
could
delay
no
longer
and
must
act
that
very
morning
interference
or
no
interference
however
he
went
obediently
up
in
the
lift
to
the
next
floor
and
while
fumbling
with
the
combination
of
the
safe
known
only
to
himself
the
cashier
and
the
manager
he
again
heard
thorpe
horrid
whisper
just
behind
him
you
must
do
it
you
must
do
it
he
came
down
again
with
the
papers
and
found
the
manager
alone
the
room
was
like
a
furnace
and
a
wave
of
dead
heated
air
met
him
in
the
face
as
he
went
in
the
moment
he
passed
the
doorway
he
realised
that
he
had
been
the
subject
of
conversation
between
the
head
cashier
and
his
enemy
they
had
been
discussing
him
perhaps
an
inkling
of
his
secret
had
somehow
got
into
their
minds
they
had
been
watching
him
for
days
past
they
had
become
suspicious
clearly
he
must
act
now
or
let
the
opportunity
slip
by
perhaps
for
ever
he
heard
thorpe
voice
in
his
ear
but
this
time
it
was
no
mere
whisper
but
a
plain
human
voice
speaking
out
loud
now
it
said
do
it
now
the
room
was
empty
only
the
manager
and
himself
were
in
it
jones
turned
from
his
desk
where
he
had
been
standing
and
locked
the
door
leading
into
the
main
office
he
saw
the
army
of
clerks
scribbling
in
their
for
the
upper
half
of
the
door
was
of
glass
he
had
perfect
control
of
himself
and
his
heart
was
beating
steadily
the
manager
hearing
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
looked
up
sharply
what
that
you
doing
he
asked
quickly
only
locking
the
door
sir
replied
the
secretary
in
a
quite
even
voice
why
who
told
you
to
the
voice
of
justice
sir
replied
jones
looking
steadily
into
the
hated
face
the
manager
looked
black
for
a
moment
and
stared
angrily
across
the
room
at
him
then
suddenly
his
expression
changed
as
he
stared
and
he
tried
to
smile
it
was
meant
to
be
a
kind
smile
evidently
but
it
only
succeeded
in
being
frightened
that
a
good
idea
in
this
weather
he
said
lightly
but
it
would
be
much
better
to
lock
it
on
the
would
it
mr
jones
i
think
not
sir
you
might
escape
me
then
now
you
ca
jones
took
his
pistol
out
and
pointed
it
at
the
other
face
down
the
barrel
he
saw
the
features
of
the
tall
dark
man
evil
and
sinister
then
the
outline
trembled
a
little
and
the
face
of
the
manager
slipped
back
into
its
place
it
was
white
as
death
and
shining
with
perspiration
you
tortured
me
to
death
four
hundred
years
ago
said
the
clerk
in
the
same
steady
voice
and
now
the
dispensers
of
justice
have
chosen
me
to
punish
you
the
manager
face
turned
to
flame
and
then
back
to
chalk
again
he
made
a
quick
movement
towards
the
telephone
bell
stretching
out
a
hand
to
reach
it
but
at
the
same
moment
jones
pulled
the
trigger
and
the
wrist
was
shattered
splashing
the
wall
behind
with
blood
that
place
where
the
chains
burnt
he
said
quietly
to
himself
his
hand
was
absolutely
steady
and
he
felt
that
he
was
a
hero
the
manager
was
on
his
feet
with
a
scream
of
pain
supporting
himself
with
his
right
hand
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
but
jones
pressed
the
trigger
again
and
a
bullet
flew
into
the
other
wrist
so
that
the
big
man
deprived
of
support
fell
forward
with
a
crash
on
to
the
desk
you
damned
madman
shrieked
the
manager
drop
that
pistol
that
place
was
all
jones
said
still
taking
careful
aim
for
another
shot
the
big
man
screaming
and
blundering
scrambled
beneath
the
desk
making
frantic
efforts
to
hide
but
the
secretary
took
a
step
forward
and
fired
two
shots
in
quick
succession
into
his
projecting
legs
hitting
first
one
ankle
and
then
the
other
and
smashing
them
horribly
two
more
places
where
the
chains
burnt
he
said
going
a
little
nearer
the
manager
still
shrieking
tried
desperately
to
squeeze
his
bulk
behind
the
shelter
of
the
opening
beneath
the
desk
but
he
was
far
too
large
and
his
bald
head
protruded
through
on
the
other
side
jones
caught
him
by
the
scruff
of
his
great
neck
and
dragged
him
yelping
out
on
to
the
carpet
he
was
covered
with
blood
and
flopped
helplessly
upon
his
broken
wrists
be
quick
now
cried
the
voice
of
thorpe
there
was
a
tremendous
commotion
and
banging
at
the
door
and
jones
gripped
his
pistol
tightly
something
seemed
to
crash
through
his
brain
clearing
it
for
a
second
so
that
he
thought
he
saw
beside
him
a
great
veiled
figure
with
drawn
sword
and
flaming
eyes
and
sternly
approving
attitude
remember
the
eyes
remember
the
eyes
hissed
thorpe
in
the
air
above
him
jones
felt
like
a
god
with
a
god
power
vengeance
disappeared
from
his
mind
he
was
acting
impersonally
as
an
instrument
in
the
hands
of
the
invisibles
who
dispense
justice
and
balance
accounts
he
bent
down
and
put
the
barrel
close
into
the
other
face
smiling
a
little
as
he
saw
the
childish
efforts
of
the
arms
to
cover
his
head
then
he
pulled
the
trigger
and
a
bullet
went
straight
into
the
right
eye
blackening
the
skin
moving
the
pistol
two
inches
the
other
way
he
sent
another
bullet
crashing
into
the
left
eye
then
he
stood
upright
over
his
victim
with
a
deep
sigh
of
satisfaction
the
manager
wriggled
convulsively
for
the
space
of
a
single
second
and
then
lay
still
in
death
there
was
not
a
moment
to
lose
for
the
door
was
already
broken
in
and
violent
hands
were
at
his
neck
jones
put
the
pistol
to
his
temple
and
once
more
pressed
the
trigger
with
his
finger
but
this
time
there
was
no
report
only
a
little
dead
click
answered
the
pressure
for
the
secretary
had
forgotten
that
the
pistol
had
only
six
chambers
and
that
he
had
used
them
all
he
threw
the
useless
weapon
on
to
the
floor
laughing
a
little
out
loud
and
turned
without
a
struggle
to
give
himself
up
i
to
do
it
he
said
quietly
while
they
tied
him
it
was
simply
my
duty
and
now
i
am
ready
to
face
the
consequences
and
thorpe
will
be
proud
of
me
for
justice
has
been
done
and
the
gods
are
satisfied
he
made
not
the
slightest
resistance
and
when
the
two
policemen
marched
him
off
through
the
crowd
of
shuddering
little
clerks
in
the
office
he
again
saw
the
veiled
figure
moving
majestically
in
front
of
him
making
slow
sweeping
circles
with
the
flaming
sword
to
keep
back
the
host
of
faces
that
were
thronging
in
upon
him
from
the
other
region
man
who
found
a
nightmare
professor
mark
ebor
the
scientist
led
a
double
life
and
the
only
persons
who
knew
it
were
his
assistant
laidlaw
and
his
publishers
but
a
double
life
need
not
always
be
a
bad
one
and
as
laidlaw
and
the
gratified
publishers
well
knew
the
parallel
lives
of
this
particular
man
were
equally
good
and
indefinitely
produced
would
certainly
have
ended
in
a
heaven
somewhere
that
can
suitably
contain
such
strangely
opposite
characteristics
as
his
remarkable
personality
combined
for
mark
ebor
was
that
unique
combination
hardly
ever
met
with
in
actual
life
a
man
of
science
and
a
mystic
as
the
first
his
name
stood
in
the
gallery
of
the
great
and
as
the
second
but
there
came
the
mystery
for
under
the
pseudonym
of
pilgrim
the
author
of
that
brilliant
series
of
books
that
appealed
to
so
many
his
identity
was
as
well
concealed
as
that
of
the
anonymous
writer
of
the
weather
reports
in
a
daily
newspaper
thousands
read
the
sanguine
optimistic
stimulating
little
books
that
issued
annually
from
the
pen
of
pilgrim
and
thousands
bore
their
daily
burdens
better
for
having
read
while
the
press
generally
agreed
that
the
author
besides
being
an
incorrigible
enthusiast
and
optimist
was
also
a
woman
but
no
one
ever
succeeded
in
penetrating
the
veil
of
anonymity
and
discovering
that
pilgrim
and
the
biologist
were
one
and
the
same
person
mark
ebor
as
laidlaw
knew
him
in
his
laboratory
was
one
man
but
mark
ebor
as
he
sometimes
saw
him
after
work
was
over
with
rapt
eyes
and
ecstatic
face
discussing
the
possibilities
of
union
with
god
and
the
future
of
the
human
race
was
quite
another
i
have
always
held
as
you
know
he
was
saying
one
evening
as
he
sat
in
the
little
study
beyond
the
laboratory
with
his
assistant
and
intimate
that
vision
should
play
a
large
part
in
the
life
of
the
awakened
man
not
to
be
regarded
as
infallible
of
course
but
to
be
observed
and
made
use
of
as
a
to
possibilities
i
am
aware
of
your
peculiar
views
sir
the
young
doctor
put
in
deferentially
yet
with
a
certain
impatience
for
visions
come
from
a
region
of
the
consciousness
where
observation
and
experiment
are
out
of
the
question
pursued
the
other
with
enthusiasm
not
noticing
the
interruption
and
while
they
should
be
checked
by
reason
afterwards
they
should
not
be
laughed
at
or
ignored
all
inspiration
i
hold
is
of
the
nature
of
interior
vision
and
all
our
best
knowledge
has
come
such
is
my
confirmed
belief
as
a
sudden
revelation
to
the
brain
prepared
to
receive
it
prepared
by
hard
work
first
by
concentration
by
the
closest
possible
study
of
ordinary
phenomena
laidlaw
allowed
himself
to
observe
perhaps
sighed
the
other
but
by
a
process
none
the
less
of
spiritual
illumination
the
best
match
in
the
world
will
not
light
a
candle
unless
the
wick
be
first
suitably
prepared
it
was
laidlaw
turn
to
sigh
he
knew
so
well
the
impossibility
of
arguing
with
his
chief
when
he
was
in
the
regions
of
the
mystic
but
at
the
same
time
the
respect
he
felt
for
his
tremendous
attainments
was
so
sincere
that
he
always
listened
with
attention
and
deference
wondering
how
far
the
great
man
would
go
and
to
what
end
this
curious
combination
of
logic
and
illumination
would
eventually
lead
him
only
last
night
continued
the
elder
man
a
sort
of
light
coming
into
his
rugged
features
the
vision
came
to
me
again
the
one
that
has
haunted
me
at
intervals
ever
since
my
youth
and
that
will
not
be
denied
laidlaw
fidgeted
in
his
chair
about
the
tablets
of
the
gods
you
mean
and
that
they
lie
somewhere
hidden
in
the
sands
he
said
patiently
a
sudden
gleam
of
interest
came
into
his
face
as
he
turned
to
catch
the
professor
reply
and
that
i
am
to
be
the
one
to
find
them
to
decipher
them
and
to
give
the
great
knowledge
to
the
world
who
will
not
believe
laughed
laidlaw
shortly
yet
interested
in
spite
of
his
contempt
because
even
the
keenest
minds
in
the
right
sense
of
the
word
are
hopelessly
unscientific
replied
the
other
gently
his
face
positively
aglow
with
the
memory
of
his
vision
yet
what
is
more
likely
he
continued
after
a
moment
pause
peering
into
space
with
rapt
eyes
that
saw
things
too
wonderful
for
exact
language
to
describe
than
that
there
should
have
been
given
to
man
in
the
first
ages
of
the
world
some
record
of
the
purpose
and
problem
that
had
been
set
him
to
solve
in
a
word
he
cried
fixing
his
shining
eyes
upon
the
face
of
his
perplexed
assistant
that
god
messengers
in
the
ages
should
have
given
to
his
creatures
some
full
statement
of
the
secret
of
the
world
of
the
secret
of
the
soul
of
the
meaning
of
life
and
death
the
explanation
of
our
being
here
and
to
what
great
end
we
are
destined
in
the
ultimate
fullness
of
things
laidlaw
sat
speechless
these
outbursts
of
mystical
enthusiasm
he
had
witnessed
before
with
any
other
man
he
would
not
have
listened
to
a
single
sentence
but
to
professor
ebor
man
of
knowledge
and
profound
investigator
he
listened
with
respect
because
he
regarded
this
condition
as
temporary
and
pathological
and
in
some
sense
a
reaction
from
the
intense
strain
of
the
prolonged
mental
concentration
of
many
days
he
smiled
with
something
between
sympathy
and
resignation
as
he
met
the
other
rapt
gaze
but
you
have
said
sir
at
other
times
that
you
consider
the
ultimate
secrets
to
be
screened
from
all
possible
the
secrets
yes
came
the
unperturbed
reply
but
that
there
lies
buried
somewhere
an
indestructible
record
of
the
secret
meaning
of
life
originally
known
to
men
in
the
days
of
their
pristine
innocence
i
am
convinced
and
by
this
strange
vision
so
often
vouchsafed
to
me
i
am
equally
sure
that
one
day
it
shall
be
given
to
me
to
announce
to
a
weary
world
this
glorious
and
terrific
message
and
he
continued
at
great
length
and
in
glowing
language
to
describe
the
species
of
vivid
dream
that
had
come
to
him
at
intervals
since
earliest
childhood
showing
in
detail
how
he
discovered
these
very
tablets
of
the
gods
and
proclaimed
their
splendid
contents
whose
precise
nature
was
always
however
withheld
from
him
in
the
vision
to
a
patient
and
suffering
humanity
the
sir
well
described
as
the
apostle
of
hope
said
the
young
doctor
gently
when
he
had
finished
and
now
if
that
reviewer
could
hear
you
speak
and
realize
from
what
strange
depths
comes
your
simple
faith
the
professor
held
up
his
hand
and
the
smile
of
a
little
child
broke
over
his
face
like
sunshine
in
the
morning
half
the
good
my
books
do
would
be
instantly
destroyed
he
said
sadly
they
would
say
that
i
wrote
with
my
tongue
in
my
cheek
but
wait
he
added
significantly
wait
till
i
find
these
tablets
of
the
gods
wait
till
i
hold
the
solutions
of
the
old
in
my
hands
wait
till
the
light
of
this
new
revelation
breaks
upon
confused
humanity
and
it
wakes
to
find
its
bravest
hopes
justified
ah
then
my
dear
laidlaw
he
broke
off
suddenly
but
the
doctor
cleverly
guessing
the
thought
in
his
mind
caught
him
up
immediately
perhaps
this
very
summer
he
said
trying
hard
to
make
the
suggestion
keep
pace
with
honesty
in
your
explorations
in
assyria
your
digging
in
the
remote
civilization
of
what
was
once
chaldea
you
may
find
what
you
dream
of
the
professor
held
up
his
hand
and
the
smile
of
a
fine
old
face
perhaps
he
murmured
softly
perhaps
and
the
young
doctor
thanking
the
gods
of
science
that
his
aberrations
were
of
so
harmless
a
character
went
home
strong
in
the
certitude
of
his
knowledge
of
externals
proud
that
he
was
able
to
refer
his
visions
to
and
wondering
complaisantly
whether
in
his
old
age
he
might
not
after
all
suffer
himself
from
visitations
of
the
very
kind
that
afflicted
his
respected
chief
and
as
he
got
into
bed
and
thought
again
of
his
master
rugged
face
and
finely
shaped
head
and
the
deep
lines
traced
by
years
of
work
and
he
turned
over
on
his
pillow
and
fell
asleep
with
a
sigh
that
was
half
of
wonder
half
of
regret
it
was
in
february
nine
months
later
when
laidlaw
made
his
way
to
charing
cross
to
meet
his
chief
after
his
long
absence
of
travel
and
exploration
the
vision
about
the
tablets
of
the
gods
had
meanwhile
passed
almost
entirely
from
his
memory
there
were
few
people
in
the
train
for
the
stream
of
traffic
was
now
running
the
other
way
and
he
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
man
he
had
come
to
meet
the
shock
of
white
hair
beneath
the
felt
hat
was
alone
enough
to
distinguish
him
by
easily
here
i
am
at
last
exclaimed
the
professor
somewhat
wearily
clasping
his
friend
hand
as
he
listened
to
the
young
doctor
warm
greetings
and
questions
here
i
am
a
little
older
and
dirtier
than
when
you
last
saw
me
he
glanced
down
laughingly
at
his
garments
and
wiser
said
laidlaw
with
a
smile
as
he
bustled
about
the
platform
for
porters
and
gave
his
chief
the
latest
scientific
news
at
last
they
came
down
to
practical
considerations
and
your
luggage
where
is
that
you
must
have
tons
of
it
i
suppose
said
laidlaw
hardly
anything
professor
ebor
answered
nothing
in
fact
but
what
you
see
nothing
but
this
laughed
the
other
thinking
he
was
joking
and
a
small
portmanteau
in
the
van
was
the
quiet
reply
i
have
no
other
luggage
you
have
no
other
luggage
repeated
laidlaw
turning
sharply
to
see
if
he
were
in
earnest
why
should
i
need
more
the
professor
added
simply
something
in
the
man
face
or
voice
or
manner
the
doctor
hardly
knew
which
suddenly
struck
him
as
strange
there
was
a
change
in
him
a
change
so
profound
so
little
on
the
surface
that
is
that
at
first
he
had
not
become
aware
of
it
for
a
moment
it
was
as
though
an
utterly
alien
personality
stood
before
him
in
that
noisy
bustling
throng
here
in
all
the
homely
friendly
turmoil
of
a
charing
cross
crowd
a
curious
feeling
of
cold
passed
over
his
heart
touching
his
life
with
icy
finger
so
that
he
actually
trembled
and
felt
afraid
he
looked
up
quickly
at
his
friend
his
mind
working
with
startled
and
unwelcome
thoughts
only
this
he
repeated
indicating
the
bag
but
where
all
the
stuff
you
went
away
with
and
have
you
brought
nothing
home
no
treasures
this
is
all
i
have
the
other
said
briefly
the
pale
smile
that
went
with
the
words
caused
the
doctor
a
second
indescribable
sensation
of
uneasiness
something
was
very
wrong
something
was
very
queer
he
wondered
now
that
he
had
not
noticed
it
sooner
the
rest
follows
of
course
by
slow
freight
he
added
tactfully
and
as
naturally
as
possible
but
come
sir
you
must
be
tired
and
in
want
of
food
after
your
long
journey
i
get
a
taxi
at
once
and
we
can
see
about
the
other
luggage
afterwards
it
seemed
to
him
he
hardly
knew
quite
what
he
was
saying
the
change
in
his
friend
had
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
and
now
grew
upon
him
more
and
more
distressingly
yet
he
could
not
make
out
exactly
in
what
it
consisted
a
terrible
suspicion
began
to
take
shape
in
his
mind
troubling
him
dreadfully
i
am
neither
very
tired
nor
in
need
of
food
thank
you
the
professor
said
quietly
and
this
is
all
i
have
there
is
no
luggage
to
follow
i
have
brought
home
nothing
nothing
but
what
you
see
his
words
conveyed
finality
they
got
into
a
taxi
tipped
the
porter
who
had
been
staring
in
amazement
at
the
venerable
figure
of
the
scientist
and
were
conveyed
slowly
and
noisily
to
the
house
in
the
north
of
london
where
the
laboratory
was
the
scene
of
their
labours
of
years
and
the
whole
way
professor
ebor
uttered
no
word
nor
did
laidlaw
find
the
courage
to
ask
a
single
question
it
was
only
late
that
night
before
he
took
his
departure
as
the
two
men
were
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
study
that
study
where
they
had
discussed
so
many
problems
of
vital
and
absorbing
interest
that
laidlaw
at
last
found
strength
to
come
to
the
point
with
direct
questions
the
professor
had
been
giving
him
a
superficial
and
desultory
account
of
his
travels
of
his
journeys
by
camel
of
his
encampments
among
the
mountains
and
in
the
desert
and
of
his
explorations
among
the
buried
temples
and
deeper
into
the
waste
of
the
sands
when
suddenly
the
doctor
came
to
the
desired
point
with
a
kind
of
nervous
rush
almost
like
a
frightened
boy
and
you
found
he
began
stammering
looking
hard
at
the
dreadfully
altered
face
from
which
every
line
of
hope
and
cheerfulness
seemed
to
have
been
obliterated
as
a
sponge
wipes
markings
from
a
slate
you
found
i
found
replied
the
other
in
a
solemn
voice
and
it
was
the
voice
of
the
mystic
rather
than
the
man
of
science
i
found
what
i
went
to
seek
the
vision
never
once
failed
me
it
led
me
straight
to
the
place
like
a
star
in
the
heavens
i
found
the
tablets
of
the
gods
laidlaw
caught
his
breath
and
steadied
himself
on
the
back
of
a
chair
the
words
fell
like
particles
of
ice
upon
his
heart
for
the
first
time
the
professor
had
uttered
the
phrase
without
the
glow
of
light
and
wonder
in
his
face
that
always
accompanied
it
you
have
brought
them
he
faltered
i
have
brought
them
home
said
the
other
in
a
voice
with
a
ring
like
iron
and
i
have
deciphered
them
profound
despair
the
bloom
of
outer
darkness
the
dead
sound
of
a
hopeless
soul
freezing
in
the
utter
cold
of
space
seemed
to
fill
in
the
pauses
between
the
brief
sentences
a
silence
followed
during
which
laidlaw
saw
nothing
but
the
white
face
before
him
alternately
fade
and
return
and
it
was
like
the
face
of
a
dead
man
they
are
alas
indestructible
he
heard
the
voice
continue
with
its
even
metallic
ring
indestructible
laidlaw
repeated
mechanically
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
saying
again
a
silence
of
several
minutes
passed
during
which
with
a
creeping
cold
about
his
heart
he
stood
and
stared
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
he
had
known
and
loved
so
long
aye
and
worshipped
too
the
man
who
had
first
opened
his
own
eyes
when
they
were
blind
and
had
led
him
to
the
gates
of
knowledge
and
no
little
distance
along
the
difficult
path
beyond
the
man
who
in
another
direction
had
passed
on
the
strength
of
his
faith
into
the
hearts
of
thousands
by
his
books
i
may
see
them
he
asked
at
last
in
a
low
voice
he
hardly
recognized
as
his
own
you
will
let
me
know
their
message
professor
ebor
kept
his
eyes
fixedly
upon
his
assistant
face
as
he
answered
with
a
smile
that
was
more
like
the
grin
of
death
than
a
living
human
smile
when
i
am
gone
he
whispered
when
i
have
passed
away
then
you
shall
find
them
and
read
the
translation
i
have
made
and
then
too
in
your
turn
you
must
try
with
the
latest
resources
of
science
at
your
disposal
to
aid
you
to
compass
their
utter
destruction
he
paused
a
moment
and
his
face
grew
pale
as
the
face
of
a
corpse
until
that
time
he
added
presently
without
looking
up
i
must
ask
you
not
to
refer
to
the
subject
again
and
to
keep
my
confidence
meanwhile
so
lute
a
year
passed
slowly
by
and
at
the
end
of
it
laidlaw
had
found
it
necessary
to
sever
his
working
connexion
with
his
friend
and
leader
professor
ebor
was
no
longer
the
same
man
the
light
had
gone
out
of
his
life
the
laboratory
was
closed
he
no
longer
put
pen
to
paper
or
applied
his
mind
to
a
single
problem
in
the
short
space
of
a
few
months
he
had
passed
from
a
hale
and
hearty
man
of
late
middle
life
to
the
condition
of
old
age
a
man
collapsed
and
on
the
edge
of
dissolution
death
it
was
plain
lay
waiting
for
him
in
the
shadows
of
any
day
and
he
knew
it
to
describe
faithfully
the
nature
of
this
profound
alteration
in
his
character
and
temperament
is
not
easy
but
laidlaw
summed
it
up
to
himself
in
three
words
of
the
splendid
mental
powers
remained
indeed
undimmed
but
the
incentive
to
use
them
to
use
them
for
the
help
of
others
had
gone
the
character
still
held
to
its
fine
and
unselfish
habits
of
years
but
the
far
goal
to
which
they
had
been
the
leading
strings
had
faded
away
the
desire
for
knowledge
knowledge
for
its
own
sake
had
died
and
the
passionate
hope
which
hitherto
had
animated
with
tireless
energy
the
heart
and
brain
of
this
splendidly
equipped
intellect
had
suffered
total
eclipse
the
central
fires
had
gone
out
nothing
was
worth
doing
thinking
working
for
there
nothing
to
work
for
any
longer
the
professor
first
step
was
to
recall
as
many
of
his
books
as
possible
his
second
to
close
his
laboratory
and
stop
all
research
he
gave
no
explanation
he
invited
no
questions
his
whole
personality
crumbled
away
so
to
speak
till
his
daily
life
became
a
mere
mechanical
process
of
clothing
the
body
feeding
the
body
keeping
it
in
good
health
so
as
to
avoid
physical
discomfort
and
above
all
doing
nothing
that
could
interfere
with
sleep
the
professor
did
everything
he
could
to
lengthen
the
hours
of
sleep
and
therefore
of
forgetfulness
it
was
all
clear
enough
to
laidlaw
a
weaker
man
he
knew
would
have
sought
to
lose
himself
in
one
form
or
another
of
sensual
indulgence
drink
the
first
pleasures
that
came
to
hand
would
have
been
the
method
of
a
little
bolder
type
and
deliberate
poisoning
with
his
awful
knowledge
all
he
could
the
means
of
still
another
kind
of
man
mark
ebor
was
none
of
these
he
held
himself
under
fine
control
facing
silently
and
without
complaint
the
terrible
facts
he
honestly
believed
himself
to
have
been
unfortunate
enough
to
discover
even
to
his
intimate
friend
and
assistant
laidlaw
he
vouchsafed
no
word
of
true
explanation
or
lament
he
went
straight
forward
to
the
end
knowing
well
that
the
end
was
not
very
far
away
and
death
came
very
quietly
one
day
to
him
as
he
was
sitting
in
the
of
the
study
directly
facing
the
doors
of
the
laboratory
the
doors
that
no
longer
opened
laidlaw
by
happy
chance
was
with
him
at
the
time
and
just
able
to
reach
his
side
in
response
to
the
sudden
painful
efforts
for
breath
just
in
time
too
to
catch
the
murmured
words
that
fell
from
the
pallid
lips
like
a
message
from
the
other
side
of
the
grave
read
them
if
you
must
and
if
you
can
destroy
but
his
voice
sank
so
low
that
laidlaw
only
just
caught
the
dying
syllables
but
never
never
give
them
to
the
world
and
like
a
grey
bundle
of
dust
loosely
gathered
up
in
an
old
garment
the
professor
sank
back
into
his
chair
and
expired
but
this
was
only
the
death
of
the
body
his
spirit
had
died
two
years
before
the
estate
of
the
dead
man
was
small
and
uncomplicated
and
laidlaw
as
sole
executor
and
residuary
legatee
had
no
difficulty
in
settling
it
up
a
month
after
the
funeral
he
was
sitting
alone
in
his
upstairs
library
the
last
sad
duties
completed
and
his
mind
full
of
poignant
memories
and
regrets
for
the
loss
of
a
friend
he
had
revered
and
loved
and
to
whom
his
debt
was
so
incalculably
great
the
last
two
years
indeed
had
been
for
him
terrible
to
watch
the
swift
decay
of
the
greatest
combination
of
heart
and
brain
he
had
ever
known
and
to
realize
he
was
powerless
to
help
was
a
source
of
profound
grief
to
him
that
would
remain
to
the
end
of
his
days
at
the
same
time
an
insatiable
curiosity
possessed
him
the
study
of
dementia
was
of
course
outside
his
special
province
as
a
specialist
but
he
knew
enough
of
it
to
understand
how
small
a
matter
might
be
the
actual
cause
of
how
great
an
illusion
and
he
had
been
devoured
from
the
very
beginning
by
a
ceaseless
and
increasing
anxiety
to
know
what
the
professor
had
found
in
the
sands
of
chaldea
what
these
precious
tablets
of
the
gods
might
be
and
particularly
for
this
was
the
real
cause
that
had
sapped
the
man
sanity
and
hope
what
the
inscription
was
that
he
had
believed
to
have
deciphered
thereon
the
curious
feature
of
it
all
to
his
own
mind
was
that
whereas
his
friend
had
dreamed
of
finding
a
message
of
glorious
hope
and
comfort
he
had
apparently
found
so
far
as
he
had
found
anything
intelligible
at
all
and
not
invented
the
whole
thing
in
his
dementia
that
the
secret
of
the
world
and
the
meaning
of
life
and
death
was
of
so
terrible
a
nature
that
it
robbed
the
heart
of
courage
and
the
soul
of
hope
what
then
could
be
the
contents
of
the
little
brown
parcel
the
professor
had
bequeathed
to
him
with
his
pregnant
dying
sentences
actually
his
hand
was
trembling
as
he
turned
to
the
and
began
slowly
to
unfasten
a
small
desk
on
which
the
small
gilt
initials
stood
forth
as
a
melancholy
memento
he
put
the
key
into
the
lock
and
half
turned
it
then
suddenly
he
stopped
and
looked
about
him
was
that
a
sound
at
the
back
of
the
room
it
was
just
as
though
someone
had
laughed
and
then
tried
to
smother
the
laugh
with
a
cough
a
slight
shiver
ran
over
him
as
he
stood
listening
this
is
absurd
he
said
aloud
too
absurd
for
belief
that
i
should
be
so
nervous
it
the
effect
of
curiosity
unduly
prolonged
he
smiled
a
little
sadly
and
his
eyes
wandered
to
the
blue
summer
sky
and
the
plane
trees
swaying
in
the
wind
below
his
window
it
the
reaction
he
continued
the
curiosity
of
two
years
to
be
quenched
in
a
single
moment
the
nervous
tension
of
course
must
be
considerable
he
turned
back
to
the
brown
desk
and
opened
it
without
further
delay
his
hand
was
firm
now
and
he
took
out
the
paper
parcel
that
lay
inside
without
a
tremor
it
was
heavy
a
moment
later
there
lay
on
the
table
before
him
a
couple
of
plaques
of
grey
stone
they
looked
like
stone
although
they
felt
like
metal
on
which
he
saw
markings
of
a
curious
character
that
might
have
been
the
mere
tracings
of
natural
forces
through
the
ages
or
equally
well
the
hieroglyphics
cut
upon
their
surface
in
past
centuries
by
the
more
or
less
untutored
hand
of
a
common
scribe
he
lifted
each
stone
in
turn
and
examined
it
carefully
it
seemed
to
him
that
a
faint
glow
of
heat
passed
from
the
substance
into
his
skin
and
he
put
them
down
again
suddenly
as
with
a
gesture
of
uneasiness
a
very
clever
or
a
very
imaginative
man
he
said
to
himself
who
could
squeeze
the
secrets
of
life
and
death
from
such
broken
lines
as
those
then
he
turned
to
a
yellow
envelope
lying
beside
them
in
the
desk
with
the
single
word
on
the
outside
in
the
writing
of
the
professor
the
word
now
he
thought
taking
it
up
with
a
sudden
violence
to
conceal
his
nervousness
now
for
the
great
solution
now
to
learn
the
meaning
of
the
worlds
and
why
mankind
was
made
and
why
discipline
is
worth
while
and
sacrifice
and
pain
the
true
law
of
advancement
there
was
the
shadow
of
a
sneer
in
his
voice
and
yet
something
in
him
shivered
at
the
same
time
he
held
the
envelope
as
though
weighing
it
in
his
hand
his
mind
pondering
many
things
then
curiosity
won
the
day
and
he
suddenly
tore
it
open
with
the
gesture
of
an
actor
who
tears
open
a
letter
on
the
stage
knowing
there
is
no
real
writing
inside
at
all
a
page
of
finely
written
script
in
the
late
scientist
handwriting
lay
before
him
he
read
it
through
from
beginning
to
end
missing
no
word
uttering
each
syllable
distinctly
under
his
breath
as
he
read
the
pallor
of
his
face
grew
ghastly
as
he
neared
the
end
he
began
to
shake
all
over
as
with
ague
his
breath
came
heavily
in
gasps
he
still
gripped
the
sheet
of
paper
however
and
deliberately
as
by
an
intense
effort
of
will
read
it
through
a
second
time
from
beginning
to
end
and
this
time
as
the
last
syllable
dropped
from
his
lips
the
whole
face
of
the
man
flamed
with
a
sudden
and
terrible
anger
his
skin
became
deep
deep
red
and
he
clenched
his
teeth
with
all
the
strength
of
his
vigorous
soul
he
was
struggling
to
keep
control
of
himself
for
perhaps
five
minutes
he
stood
there
beside
the
table
without
stirring
a
muscle
he
might
have
been
carved
out
of
stone
his
eyes
were
shut
and
only
the
heaving
of
the
chest
betrayed
the
fact
that
he
was
a
living
being
then
with
a
strange
quietness
he
lit
a
match
and
applied
it
to
the
sheet
of
paper
he
held
in
his
hand
the
ashes
fell
slowly
about
him
piece
by
piece
and
he
blew
them
from
the
into
the
air
his
eyes
following
them
as
they
floated
away
on
the
summer
wind
that
breathed
so
warmly
over
the
world
he
turned
back
slowly
into
the
room
although
his
actions
and
movements
were
absolutely
steady
and
controlled
it
was
clear
that
he
was
on
the
edge
of
violent
action
a
hurricane
might
burst
upon
the
still
room
any
moment
his
muscles
were
tense
and
rigid
then
suddenly
he
whitened
collapsed
and
sank
backwards
into
a
chair
like
a
tumbled
bundle
of
inert
matter
he
had
fainted
in
less
than
half
an
hour
he
recovered
consciousness
and
sat
up
as
before
he
made
no
sound
not
a
syllable
passed
his
lips
he
rose
quietly
and
looked
about
the
room
then
he
did
a
curious
thing
taking
a
heavy
stick
from
the
rack
in
the
corner
he
approached
the
mantlepiece
and
with
a
heavy
shattering
blow
he
smashed
the
clock
to
pieces
the
glass
fell
in
shivering
atoms
cease
your
lying
voice
for
ever
he
said
in
a
curiously
still
even
tone
there
is
no
such
thing
as
he
took
the
watch
from
his
pocket
swung
it
round
several
times
by
the
long
gold
chain
smashed
it
into
smithereens
against
the
wall
with
a
single
blow
and
then
walked
into
his
laboratory
next
door
and
hung
its
broken
body
on
the
bones
of
the
skeleton
in
the
corner
of
the
room
let
one
damned
mockery
hang
upon
another
he
said
smiling
oddly
delusions
both
of
you
and
cruel
as
false
he
slowly
moved
back
to
the
front
room
he
stopped
opposite
the
bookcase
where
stood
in
a
row
the
scriptures
of
the
world
choicely
bound
and
exquisitely
printed
the
late
professor
most
treasured
possession
and
next
to
them
several
books
signed
pilgrim
one
by
one
he
took
them
from
the
shelf
and
hurled
them
through
the
open
window
a
devil
dreams
a
devil
foolish
dreams
he
cried
with
a
vicious
laugh
presently
he
stopped
from
sheer
exhaustion
he
turned
his
eyes
slowly
to
the
wall
opposite
where
hung
a
weird
array
of
eastern
swords
and
daggers
scimitars
and
spears
the
collections
of
many
journeys
he
crossed
the
room
and
ran
his
finger
along
the
edge
his
mind
seemed
to
waver
no
he
muttered
presently
not
that
way
there
are
easier
and
better
ways
than
that
he
took
his
hat
and
passed
downstairs
into
the
street
it
was
five
and
the
june
sun
lay
hot
upon
the
pavement
he
felt
the
metal
burn
the
palm
of
his
hand
ah
laidlaw
this
is
well
met
cried
a
voice
at
his
elbow
i
was
in
the
act
of
coming
to
see
you
i
a
case
that
will
interest
you
and
besides
i
remembered
that
you
flavoured
your
tea
with
orange
leaves
and
i
admit
it
was
alexis
stephen
the
great
hypnotic
doctor
i
had
no
tea
laidlaw
said
in
a
dazed
manner
after
staring
for
a
moment
as
though
the
other
had
struck
him
in
the
face
a
new
idea
had
entered
his
mind
what
the
matter
asked
stephen
quickly
something
wrong
with
you
it
this
sudden
heat
or
overwork
come
man
let
go
inside
a
sudden
light
broke
upon
the
face
of
the
younger
man
the
light
of
a
inspiration
he
looked
into
his
friend
face
and
told
a
direct
lie
odd
he
said
i
myself
was
just
coming
to
see
you
i
have
something
of
great
importance
to
test
your
confidence
with
but
in
house
please
as
stephen
urged
him
towards
his
own
door
in
your
house
only
round
the
corner
and
i
i
can
not
go
back
there
to
my
rooms
till
i
have
told
you
i
your
patient
for
the
moment
he
added
stammeringly
as
soon
as
they
were
seated
in
the
privacy
of
the
hypnotist
sanctum
and
i
want
er
my
dear
laidlaw
interrupted
the
other
in
that
soothing
voice
of
command
which
had
suggested
to
many
a
suffering
soul
that
the
cure
for
its
pain
lay
in
the
powers
of
its
own
reawakened
will
i
am
always
at
your
service
as
you
know
you
have
only
to
tell
me
what
i
can
do
for
you
and
i
will
do
it
he
showed
every
desire
to
help
him
out
his
manner
was
indescribably
tactful
and
direct
laidlaw
looked
up
into
his
face
i
surrender
my
will
to
you
he
said
already
calmed
by
the
healing
presence
and
i
want
you
to
treat
me
hypnotically
and
at
once
i
want
you
to
suggest
to
me
his
voice
became
very
tense
that
i
shall
forget
forget
till
i
die
everything
that
has
occurred
to
me
during
the
last
two
hours
till
i
die
mind
he
added
with
solemn
emphasis
till
i
die
he
floundered
and
stammered
like
a
frightened
boy
alexis
stephen
looked
at
him
fixedly
without
speaking
and
further
laidlaw
continued
i
want
you
to
ask
me
no
questions
i
wish
to
forget
for
ever
something
i
have
recently
discovered
something
so
terrible
and
yet
so
obvious
that
i
can
hardly
understand
why
it
is
not
patent
to
every
mind
in
the
world
for
i
have
had
a
moment
of
absolute
of
merciless
clairvoyance
but
i
want
no
one
else
in
the
whole
world
to
know
what
it
is
least
of
all
old
friend
yourself
he
talked
in
utter
confusion
and
hardly
knew
what
he
was
saying
but
the
pain
on
his
face
and
the
anguish
in
his
voice
were
an
instant
passport
to
the
other
heart
nothing
is
easier
replied
stephen
after
a
hesitation
so
slight
that
the
other
probably
did
not
even
notice
it
come
into
my
other
room
where
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
i
can
heal
you
your
memory
of
the
last
two
hours
shall
be
wiped
out
as
though
it
had
never
been
you
can
trust
me
absolutely
i
know
i
can
laidlaw
said
simply
as
he
followed
him
in
an
hour
later
they
passed
back
into
the
front
room
again
the
sun
was
already
behind
the
houses
opposite
and
the
shadows
began
to
gather
i
went
off
easily
laidlaw
asked
you
were
a
little
obstinate
at
first
but
though
you
came
in
like
a
lion
you
went
out
like
a
lamb
i
let
you
sleep
a
bit
afterwards
stephen
kept
his
eyes
rather
steadily
upon
his
friend
face
what
were
you
doing
by
the
fire
before
you
came
here
he
asked
pausing
in
a
casual
tone
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
handed
the
case
to
his
patient
i
let
me
see
oh
i
know
i
was
worrying
my
way
through
poor
old
ebor
papers
and
things
i
his
executor
you
know
then
i
got
weary
and
came
out
for
a
whiff
of
air
he
spoke
lightly
and
with
perfect
naturalness
obviously
he
was
telling
the
truth
i
prefer
specimens
to
papers
he
laughed
cheerily
i
know
i
know
said
stephen
holding
a
lighted
match
for
the
cigarette
his
face
wore
an
expression
of
content
the
experiment
had
been
a
complete
success
the
memory
of
the
last
two
hours
was
wiped
out
utterly
laidlaw
was
already
chatting
gaily
and
easily
about
a
dozen
other
things
that
interested
him
together
they
went
out
into
the
street
and
at
his
door
stephen
left
him
with
a
joke
and
a
wry
face
that
made
his
friend
laugh
heartily
do
dine
on
the
professor
old
papers
by
mistake
he
cried
as
he
vanished
down
the
street
laidlaw
went
up
to
his
study
at
the
top
of
the
house
half
way
down
he
met
his
housekeeper
fewings
she
was
flustered
and
excited
and
her
face
was
very
red
and
perspiring
there
been
burglars
here
she
cried
excitedly
or
something
funny
all
your
things
is
just
sir
i
found
everything
all
about
everywhere
she
was
very
confused
in
this
orderly
and
very
precise
establishment
it
was
unusual
to
find
a
thing
out
of
place
oh
my
specimens
cried
the
doctor
dashing
up
the
rest
of
the
stairs
at
top
speed
have
they
been
touched
or
he
flew
to
the
door
of
the
laboratory
fewings
panted
up
heavily
behind
him
the
labatry
ai
been
touched
she
explained
breathlessly
but
they
smashed
the
libry
clock
and
they
your
gold
watch
sir
on
the
skelinton
hands
and
the
books
that
were
no
value
they
flung
out
er
the
window
just
like
so
much
rubbish
they
must
have
been
wild
drunk
laidlaw
sir
the
young
scientist
made
a
hurried
examination
of
the
rooms
nothing
of
value
was
missing
he
began
to
wonder
what
kind
of
burglars
they
were
he
looked
up
sharply
at
fewings
standing
in
the
doorway
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
cast
about
in
his
mind
for
something
odd
he
said
at
length
i
only
left
here
an
hour
ago
and
everything
was
all
right
then
was
it
sir
yes
sir
she
glanced
sharply
at
him
her
room
looked
out
upon
the
courtyard
and
she
must
have
seen
the
books
come
crashing
down
and
also
have
heard
her
master
leave
the
house
a
few
minutes
later
and
what
this
rubbish
the
brutes
have
left
he
cried
taking
up
two
slabs
of
worn
gray
stone
on
the
bath
brick
or
something
i
do
declare
he
looked
very
sharply
again
at
the
confused
and
troubled
housekeeper
throw
them
on
the
dust
heap
fewings
and
and
let
me
know
if
anything
is
missing
in
the
house
and
i
will
notify
the
police
this
evening
when
she
left
the
room
he
went
into
the
laboratory
and
took
his
watch
off
the
skeleton
fingers
his
face
wore
a
troubled
expression
but
after
a
moment
thought
it
cleared
again
his
memory
was
a
complete
blank
i
suppose
i
left
it
on
the
when
i
went
out
to
take
the
air
he
said
and
there
was
no
one
present
to
contradict
him
he
crossed
to
the
window
and
blew
carelessly
some
ashes
of
burned
paper
from
the
sill
and
stood
watching
them
as
they
floated
away
lazily
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
glamour
of
the
i
hibbert
always
conscious
of
two
worlds
was
in
this
mountain
village
conscious
of
three
it
lay
on
the
slopes
of
the
valais
alps
and
he
had
taken
a
room
in
the
little
post
office
where
he
could
be
at
peace
to
write
his
book
yet
at
the
same
time
enjoy
the
winter
sports
and
find
companionship
in
the
hotels
when
he
wanted
it
the
three
worlds
that
met
and
mingled
here
seemed
to
his
imaginative
temperament
very
obvious
though
it
is
doubtful
if
another
mind
less
intuitively
equipped
would
have
seen
them
so
there
was
the
world
of
tourist
english
civilised
to
which
he
belonged
by
birth
at
any
rate
there
was
the
world
of
peasants
to
which
he
felt
himself
drawn
by
sympathy
for
he
loved
and
admired
their
toiling
simple
life
and
there
was
this
other
which
he
could
only
call
the
world
of
nature
to
this
last
however
in
virtue
of
a
vehement
poetic
imagination
and
a
tumultuous
pagan
instinct
fed
by
his
very
blood
he
felt
that
most
of
him
belonged
the
others
borrowed
from
it
as
it
were
for
visits
here
with
the
soul
of
nature
hid
his
central
life
between
all
three
was
conflict
potential
conflict
on
the
each
sunday
the
tourists
regarded
the
natives
as
intruders
in
the
church
the
peasants
plainly
questioned
why
do
you
come
we
are
here
to
worship
you
to
stare
and
whisper
for
neither
of
these
two
worlds
accepted
the
other
and
neither
did
nature
accept
the
tourists
for
it
took
advantage
of
their
least
mistakes
and
indeed
even
of
the
accepted
only
those
who
were
strong
and
bold
enough
to
invade
her
savage
domain
with
sufficient
skill
to
protect
themselves
from
several
forms
of
death
now
hibbert
was
keenly
aware
of
this
potential
conflict
and
want
of
harmony
he
felt
outside
yet
caught
by
it
torn
in
the
three
directions
because
he
was
partly
of
each
world
but
wholly
in
only
one
there
grew
in
him
a
constant
subtle
effort
or
at
least
desire
to
unify
them
and
decide
positively
to
which
he
should
belong
and
live
in
the
attempt
of
course
was
largely
subconscious
it
was
the
natural
instinct
of
a
richly
imaginative
nature
seeking
the
point
of
equilibrium
so
that
the
mind
could
feel
at
peace
and
his
brain
be
free
to
do
good
work
among
the
guests
no
one
especially
claimed
his
interest
the
men
were
nice
but
undistinguished
athletic
schoolmasters
doctors
snatching
a
holiday
good
fellows
all
the
women
equally
various
the
clever
the
the
the
women
who
understood
and
the
usual
pack
of
jolly
dancing
girls
and
flappers
and
hibbert
with
his
forty
odd
years
of
thick
experience
behind
him
got
on
well
with
the
lot
he
understood
them
all
they
belonged
to
definite
predigested
types
that
are
the
same
the
world
over
and
that
he
had
met
the
world
over
long
ago
but
to
none
of
them
did
he
belong
his
nature
was
too
multiple
to
subscribe
to
the
set
of
shibboleths
of
any
one
class
and
since
all
liked
him
and
felt
that
somehow
he
seemed
outside
of
them
spectator
all
sought
to
claim
him
in
a
sense
therefore
the
three
worlds
fought
for
him
natives
tourists
nature
it
was
thus
began
the
singular
conflict
for
the
soul
of
hibbert
his
own
soul
however
it
took
place
neither
the
peasants
nor
the
tourists
were
conscious
that
they
fought
for
anything
and
nature
they
say
is
merely
blind
and
automatic
the
assault
upon
him
of
the
peasants
may
be
left
out
of
account
for
it
is
obvious
that
they
stood
no
chance
of
success
the
tourist
world
however
made
a
gallant
effort
to
subdue
him
to
themselves
but
the
evenings
in
the
hotel
when
dancing
was
not
in
order
were
english
the
provincial
imagination
was
set
upon
a
throne
and
worshipped
heavily
through
incense
of
the
stupidest
conventions
possible
hibbert
used
to
go
back
early
to
his
room
in
the
post
office
to
work
it
is
a
mistake
on
my
part
to
have
that
there
is
any
conflict
at
all
he
thought
as
he
crunched
home
over
the
snow
at
midnight
after
one
of
the
dances
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
kept
outside
it
all
and
done
my
work
better
he
added
looking
back
down
the
silent
village
street
to
the
church
tower
and
safer
the
adjective
slipped
from
his
mind
before
he
was
aware
of
it
he
turned
with
an
involuntary
start
and
looked
about
him
he
knew
perfectly
well
what
it
meant
this
thought
that
had
thrust
its
head
up
from
the
instinctive
region
he
understood
without
being
able
to
express
it
fully
the
meaning
that
betrayed
itself
in
the
choice
of
the
adjective
for
if
he
had
ignored
the
existence
of
this
conflict
he
would
at
the
same
time
have
remained
outside
the
arena
whereas
now
he
had
entered
the
lists
now
this
battle
for
his
soul
must
have
issue
and
he
knew
that
the
spell
of
nature
was
greater
for
him
than
all
other
spells
in
the
world
combined
greater
than
love
revelry
pleasure
greater
even
than
study
he
had
always
been
afraid
to
let
himself
go
his
pagan
soul
dreaded
her
terrific
powers
of
witchery
even
while
he
worshipped
the
little
village
already
slept
the
world
lay
smothered
in
snow
the
chalet
roofs
shone
white
beneath
the
moon
and
shadows
gathered
against
the
walls
of
the
church
his
eye
rested
a
moment
on
the
square
stone
tower
with
its
frosted
cross
that
pointed
to
the
sky
then
travelled
with
a
leap
of
many
thousand
feet
to
the
enormous
mountains
that
brushed
the
brilliant
stars
like
a
forest
rose
the
huge
peaks
above
the
slumbering
village
measuring
the
night
and
heavens
they
beckoned
him
and
something
born
of
the
snowy
desolation
born
of
the
midnight
and
the
silent
grandeur
born
of
the
great
listening
hollows
of
the
night
something
that
lay
terror
and
wonder
dropped
from
the
vast
wintry
spaces
down
into
his
heart
and
called
him
very
softly
unrecorded
in
any
word
or
thought
his
brain
could
compass
it
laid
its
spell
upon
him
fingers
of
snow
brushed
the
surface
of
his
heart
the
power
and
quiet
majesty
of
the
winter
night
appalled
him
fumbling
a
moment
with
the
big
unwieldy
key
he
let
himself
in
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
two
thoughts
went
with
him
apparently
quite
ordinary
and
sensible
ones
what
fools
these
peasants
are
to
sleep
through
such
a
night
and
the
other
those
dances
tire
me
i
never
go
again
my
work
only
suffers
in
the
morning
the
claims
of
peasants
and
tourists
upon
him
seemed
thus
in
a
single
instant
weakened
the
clash
of
battle
troubled
half
his
dreams
nature
had
sent
her
beauty
of
the
night
and
won
the
first
assault
the
others
routed
and
dismayed
fled
far
away
ii
do
go
back
to
your
dreary
old
post
office
we
going
to
have
supper
in
my
room
something
hot
come
and
join
us
hurry
up
there
had
been
an
ice
carnival
and
the
last
party
tailing
up
the
to
the
hotel
called
him
the
chinese
lanterns
smoked
and
sputtered
on
the
wires
the
band
had
long
since
gone
the
cold
was
bitter
and
the
moon
came
only
momentarily
between
high
driving
clouds
from
the
shed
where
the
people
changed
from
skates
to
he
shouted
something
to
the
effect
that
he
was
following
but
no
answer
came
the
moving
shadows
of
those
who
had
called
were
already
merged
high
up
against
the
village
darkness
the
voices
died
away
doors
slammed
hibbert
found
himself
alone
on
the
deserted
rink
and
it
was
then
quite
suddenly
the
impulse
came
to
stay
and
skate
alone
the
thought
of
the
stuffy
hotel
room
and
of
those
noisy
people
with
their
obvious
jokes
and
laughter
oppressed
him
he
felt
a
longing
to
be
alone
with
the
night
to
taste
her
wonder
all
by
himself
there
beneath
the
stars
gliding
over
the
ice
it
was
not
yet
midnight
and
he
could
skate
for
half
an
hour
that
supper
party
if
they
noticed
his
absence
at
all
would
merely
think
he
had
changed
his
mind
and
gone
to
bed
it
was
an
impulse
yes
and
not
an
unnatural
one
yet
even
at
the
time
it
struck
him
that
something
more
than
impulse
lay
concealed
behind
it
more
than
invitation
yet
certainly
less
than
command
there
was
a
vague
queer
feeling
that
he
stayed
because
he
had
to
almost
as
though
there
was
something
he
had
forgotten
overlooked
left
undone
imaginative
temperaments
are
often
thus
and
impulse
is
ever
weakness
for
with
such
opening
of
the
doors
to
hasty
action
may
come
an
invasion
of
other
forces
at
the
same
time
forces
merely
waiting
their
opportunity
perhaps
he
caught
the
fugitive
warning
even
while
he
dismissed
it
as
absurd
and
the
next
minute
he
was
whirling
over
the
smooth
ice
in
delightful
curves
and
loops
beneath
the
moon
there
was
no
fear
of
collision
he
could
take
his
own
speed
and
space
as
he
willed
the
shadows
of
the
towering
mountains
fell
across
the
rink
and
a
wind
of
ice
came
from
the
forests
where
the
snow
lay
ten
feet
deep
the
hotel
lights
winked
and
went
out
the
village
slept
the
high
wire
netting
could
not
keep
out
the
wonder
of
the
winter
night
that
grew
about
him
like
a
presence
he
skated
on
and
on
keen
exhilarating
pleasure
in
his
tingling
blood
and
weariness
all
forgotten
and
then
midway
in
the
delight
of
rushing
movement
he
saw
a
figure
gliding
behind
the
wire
netting
watching
him
with
a
start
that
almost
made
him
lose
his
balance
for
the
abruptness
of
the
new
arrival
was
so
unlooked
for
he
paused
and
stared
although
the
light
was
dim
he
made
out
that
it
was
the
figure
of
a
woman
and
that
she
was
feeling
her
way
along
the
netting
trying
to
get
in
against
the
white
background
of
the
he
watched
her
rather
stealthy
efforts
as
she
passed
with
a
silent
step
over
the
snow
she
was
tall
and
slim
and
graceful
he
could
see
that
even
in
the
dark
and
then
of
course
he
understood
it
was
another
adventurous
skater
like
himself
stolen
down
unawares
from
hotel
or
chalet
and
searching
for
the
opening
at
once
making
a
sign
and
pointing
with
one
hand
he
turned
swiftly
and
skated
over
to
the
little
entrance
on
the
other
side
but
even
before
he
got
there
there
was
a
sound
on
the
ice
behind
him
and
with
an
exclamation
of
amazement
he
could
not
suppress
he
turned
to
see
her
swerving
up
to
his
side
across
the
width
of
the
rink
she
had
somehow
found
another
way
in
hibbert
as
a
rule
was
punctilious
and
in
these
places
perhaps
especially
so
if
only
for
his
own
protection
he
did
not
seek
to
make
advances
unless
some
kind
of
introduction
paved
the
way
but
for
these
two
to
skate
together
in
the
without
speech
often
of
necessity
brushing
shoulders
almost
was
too
absurd
to
think
of
accordingly
he
raised
his
cap
and
spoke
his
actual
words
he
seems
unable
to
recall
nor
what
the
girl
said
in
reply
except
that
she
answered
him
in
accented
english
with
some
commonplace
about
doing
figures
at
midnight
on
an
empty
rink
quite
natural
it
was
and
right
she
wore
grey
clothes
of
some
kind
though
not
the
customary
long
gloves
or
sweater
for
indeed
her
hands
were
bare
and
presently
when
he
skated
with
her
he
wondered
with
something
like
astonishment
at
their
dry
and
icy
coldness
and
she
was
delicious
to
skate
with
supple
sure
and
light
fast
as
a
man
yet
with
the
freedom
of
a
child
sinuous
and
steady
at
the
same
time
her
flexibility
made
him
wonder
and
when
he
asked
where
she
had
learned
she
murmured
he
caught
the
breath
against
his
ear
and
recalled
later
that
it
was
singularly
cold
that
she
could
hardly
tell
for
she
had
been
accustomed
to
the
ice
ever
since
she
could
remember
but
her
face
he
never
properly
saw
a
muffler
of
white
fur
buried
her
neck
to
the
ears
and
her
cap
came
over
the
eyes
he
only
saw
that
she
was
young
nor
could
he
gather
her
hotel
or
chalet
for
she
pointed
vaguely
when
he
asked
her
up
the
slopes
just
over
there
she
said
quickly
taking
his
hand
again
he
did
not
press
her
no
doubt
she
wished
to
hide
her
escapade
and
the
touch
of
her
hand
thrilled
him
more
than
anything
he
could
remember
even
through
his
thick
glove
he
felt
the
softness
of
that
cold
and
delicate
softness
the
clouds
thickened
over
the
mountains
it
grew
darker
they
talked
very
little
and
did
not
always
skate
together
often
they
separated
curving
about
in
corners
by
themselves
but
always
coming
together
again
in
the
centre
of
the
rink
and
when
she
left
him
thus
hibbert
was
conscious
of
yes
of
missing
her
he
found
a
peculiar
satisfaction
almost
a
fascination
in
skating
by
her
side
it
was
quite
an
adventure
these
two
strangers
with
the
ice
and
snow
and
night
midnight
had
long
since
sounded
from
the
old
church
tower
before
they
parted
she
gave
the
sign
and
he
skated
quickly
to
the
shed
meaning
to
find
a
seat
and
help
her
take
her
skates
off
yet
when
he
turned
she
had
already
gone
he
saw
her
slim
figure
gliding
away
across
the
snow
and
hurrying
for
the
last
time
round
the
rink
alone
he
searched
in
vain
for
the
opening
she
had
twice
used
in
this
curious
way
how
very
queer
he
thought
referring
to
the
wire
netting
she
must
have
lifted
it
and
wriggled
under
wondering
how
in
the
world
she
managed
it
what
in
the
world
had
possessed
him
to
be
so
free
with
her
and
who
in
the
world
she
was
he
went
up
the
steep
slope
to
the
post
office
and
so
to
bed
her
promise
to
come
again
another
night
still
ringing
delightfully
in
his
ears
and
curious
were
the
thoughts
and
sensations
that
accompanied
him
most
of
all
perhaps
was
the
half
suggestion
of
some
dim
memory
that
he
had
known
this
girl
before
had
met
her
somewhere
more
that
she
knew
him
for
in
her
voice
a
low
soft
windy
little
voice
it
was
tender
and
soothing
for
all
its
quiet
coldness
there
lay
some
faint
reminder
of
two
others
he
had
known
both
long
since
gone
the
voice
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
and
the
voice
of
his
mother
but
this
time
through
his
dreams
there
ran
no
clash
of
battle
he
was
conscious
rather
of
something
cold
and
clinging
that
made
him
think
of
sifting
snowflakes
climbing
slowly
with
entangling
touch
and
thickness
round
his
feet
the
snow
coming
without
noise
each
flake
so
light
and
tiny
none
can
mark
the
spot
whereon
it
settles
yet
the
mass
of
it
able
to
smother
whole
villages
wove
through
the
very
texture
of
his
mind
cold
bewildering
deadening
effort
with
its
clinging
network
of
ten
million
feathery
touches
iii
in
the
morning
hibbert
realised
he
had
done
perhaps
a
foolish
thing
the
brilliant
sunshine
that
drenched
the
valley
made
him
see
this
and
the
sight
of
his
with
its
typewriter
books
papers
and
the
rest
brought
additional
conviction
to
have
skated
with
a
girl
alone
at
midnight
no
matter
how
innocently
the
thing
had
come
about
was
unwise
unfair
especially
to
her
gossip
in
these
little
winter
resorts
was
worse
than
in
a
provincial
town
he
hoped
no
one
had
seen
them
luckily
the
night
had
been
dark
most
likely
none
had
heard
the
ring
of
skates
deciding
that
in
future
he
would
be
more
careful
he
plunged
into
work
and
sought
to
dismiss
the
matter
from
his
mind
but
in
his
times
of
leisure
the
memory
returned
persistently
to
haunt
him
when
he
luged
or
danced
in
the
evenings
and
especially
when
he
skated
on
the
little
rink
he
was
aware
that
the
eyes
of
his
mind
forever
sought
this
strange
companion
of
the
night
a
hundred
times
he
fancied
that
he
saw
her
but
always
sight
deceived
him
her
face
he
might
not
know
but
he
could
hardly
fail
to
recognise
her
figure
yet
nowhere
among
the
others
did
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
that
slim
young
creature
he
had
skated
with
alone
beneath
the
clouded
stars
he
searched
in
vain
even
his
inquiries
as
to
the
occupants
of
the
private
chalets
brought
no
results
he
had
lost
her
but
the
queer
thing
was
that
he
felt
as
though
she
were
somewhere
close
he
she
had
not
really
gone
while
people
came
and
left
with
every
day
it
never
once
occurred
to
him
that
she
had
left
on
the
contrary
he
felt
assured
that
they
would
meet
again
this
thought
he
never
quite
acknowledged
perhaps
it
was
the
wish
that
fathered
it
only
and
even
when
he
did
meet
her
it
was
a
question
how
he
would
speak
and
claim
acquaintance
or
whether
would
recognise
himself
it
might
be
awkward
he
almost
came
to
dread
a
meeting
though
dread
of
course
was
far
too
strong
a
word
to
describe
an
emotion
that
was
half
delight
half
wondering
anticipation
meanwhile
the
season
was
in
full
swing
hibbert
felt
in
perfect
health
worked
hard
skated
luged
and
at
night
danced
fairly
often
in
spite
of
his
decision
this
dancing
was
however
an
act
of
subconscious
surrender
it
really
meant
he
hoped
to
find
her
among
the
whirling
couples
he
was
searching
for
her
without
quite
acknowledging
it
to
himself
and
the
meanwhile
thinking
it
had
won
him
over
teased
and
chaffed
him
he
made
excuses
in
a
similar
vein
but
all
the
time
he
watched
and
searched
and
waited
for
several
days
the
sky
held
clear
and
bright
and
frosty
bitterly
cold
everything
crisp
and
sparkling
in
the
sun
but
there
was
no
sign
of
fresh
snow
and
the
began
to
grumble
on
the
mountains
was
an
icy
crust
that
made
running
dangerous
they
wanted
the
frozen
dry
and
powdery
snow
that
makes
for
speed
renders
steering
easier
and
falling
less
severe
but
the
keen
east
wind
showed
no
signs
of
changing
for
a
whole
ten
days
then
suddenly
there
came
a
touch
of
softer
air
and
the
began
to
prophesy
hibbert
who
was
delicately
sensitive
to
the
least
change
in
earth
or
sky
was
perhaps
the
first
to
feel
it
only
he
did
not
prophesy
he
knew
through
every
nerve
in
his
body
that
moisture
had
crept
into
the
air
was
accumulating
and
that
presently
a
fall
would
come
for
he
responded
to
the
moods
of
nature
like
a
fine
barometer
and
the
knowledge
this
time
brought
into
his
heart
a
strange
little
wayward
emotion
that
was
hard
to
account
for
a
feeling
of
unexplained
uneasiness
and
disquieting
joy
for
behind
it
woven
through
it
rather
ran
a
faint
exhilaration
that
connected
remotely
somewhere
with
that
touch
of
delicious
alarm
that
tiny
anticipating
dread
that
so
puzzled
him
when
he
thought
of
his
next
meeting
with
his
skating
companion
of
the
night
it
lay
beyond
all
words
all
telling
this
queer
relationship
between
the
two
but
somehow
the
girl
and
snow
ran
in
a
pair
across
his
mind
perhaps
for
imaginative
more
than
for
other
workers
the
smallest
change
of
mood
betrays
itself
at
once
his
work
at
any
rate
revealed
this
slight
shifting
of
emotional
values
in
his
soul
not
that
his
writing
suffered
but
that
it
altered
subtly
as
those
changes
of
sky
or
sea
or
landscape
that
come
with
the
passing
of
afternoon
into
evening
imperceptibly
a
subconscious
excitement
sought
to
push
outwards
and
express
itself
and
knowing
the
uneven
effect
such
moods
produced
in
his
work
he
laid
his
pen
aside
and
took
instead
to
reading
that
he
had
to
do
meanwhile
the
brilliance
passed
from
the
sunshine
the
sky
grew
slowly
overcast
by
dusk
the
mountain
tops
came
singularly
close
and
sharp
the
distant
valley
rose
into
absurdly
near
perspective
the
moisture
increased
rapidly
approaching
saturation
point
when
it
must
fall
in
snow
hibbert
watched
and
waited
and
in
the
morning
the
world
lay
smothered
beneath
its
fresh
white
carpet
it
snowed
heavily
till
noon
thickly
incessantly
chokingly
a
foot
or
more
then
the
sky
cleared
the
sun
came
out
in
splendour
the
wind
shifted
back
to
the
east
and
frost
came
down
upon
the
mountains
with
its
keenest
and
most
biting
tooth
the
drop
in
the
temperature
was
tremendous
but
the
were
jubilant
next
day
the
running
would
be
fast
and
perfect
already
the
mass
was
settling
and
the
surface
freezing
into
those
powdery
crystals
that
make
the
ski
run
almost
of
their
own
accord
with
the
faint
sishing
as
of
a
bird
wings
through
the
air
iv
that
night
there
was
excitement
in
the
little
first
because
there
was
a
but
chiefly
because
the
new
snow
had
come
and
hibbert
went
felt
drawn
to
go
he
did
not
go
in
costume
but
he
wanted
to
talk
about
the
slopes
and
with
the
other
men
and
at
the
same
time
ah
there
was
the
truth
the
deeper
necessity
that
called
for
the
singular
connection
between
the
stranger
and
the
snow
again
betrayed
itself
utterly
beyond
explanation
as
before
but
vital
and
insistent
some
hidden
instinct
in
his
pagan
soul
heaven
knows
how
he
phrased
it
even
to
himself
if
he
phrased
it
at
all
whispered
that
with
the
snow
the
girl
would
be
somewhere
about
would
emerge
from
her
hiding
place
would
even
look
for
him
absolutely
unwarranted
it
was
he
laughed
while
he
stood
before
the
little
glass
and
trimmed
his
moustache
tried
to
make
his
black
tie
sit
straight
and
shook
down
his
dinner
jacket
so
that
it
should
lie
upon
the
shoulders
without
a
crease
his
brown
eyes
were
very
bright
i
look
younger
than
i
usually
do
he
thought
it
was
unusual
even
significant
in
a
man
who
had
no
vanity
about
his
appearance
and
certainly
never
questioned
his
age
or
tried
to
look
younger
than
he
was
affairs
of
the
heart
with
one
tumultuous
exception
that
left
no
fuel
for
lesser
subsequent
fires
had
never
troubled
him
the
forces
of
his
soul
and
mind
not
called
upon
for
work
and
obvious
duties
all
went
to
nature
the
desolate
wild
places
of
the
earth
were
what
he
loved
night
and
the
beauty
of
the
stars
and
snow
and
this
evening
he
felt
their
claims
upon
him
mightily
stirring
a
rising
wildness
caught
his
blood
quickened
his
pulse
woke
longing
and
passion
too
but
chiefly
snow
the
snow
whirred
softly
through
his
thoughts
like
white
seductive
dreams
for
the
snow
had
come
and
she
it
seemed
had
somehow
come
with
it
into
his
mind
and
yet
he
stood
before
that
twisted
mirror
and
pulled
his
tie
and
coat
askew
a
dozen
times
as
though
it
mattered
what
in
the
world
is
up
with
me
he
thought
then
laughing
a
little
he
turned
before
leaving
the
room
to
put
his
private
papers
in
order
the
green
morocco
desk
that
held
them
he
took
down
from
the
shelf
and
laid
upon
the
table
tied
to
the
lid
was
the
visiting
card
with
his
brother
london
address
in
case
of
accident
on
the
way
down
to
the
hotel
he
wondered
why
he
had
done
this
for
though
imaginative
he
was
not
the
kind
of
man
who
dealt
in
presentiments
moods
with
him
were
strong
but
ever
held
in
leash
it
almost
like
a
warning
he
thought
smiling
he
drew
his
thick
coat
tightly
round
the
throat
as
the
freezing
air
bit
at
him
those
warnings
one
reads
of
in
stories
sometimes
a
delicious
happiness
was
in
his
blood
over
the
edge
of
the
hills
across
the
valley
rose
the
moon
he
saw
her
silver
sheet
the
world
of
snow
snow
covered
all
it
smothered
sound
and
distance
it
smothered
houses
streets
and
human
beings
it
smothered
life
v
in
the
hall
there
was
light
and
bustle
people
were
already
arriving
from
the
other
hotels
and
chalets
their
costumes
hidden
beneath
many
wraps
groups
of
men
in
evening
dress
stood
about
smoking
talking
snow
and
the
band
was
tuning
up
the
claims
of
the
clashed
about
him
faintly
as
of
old
at
the
big
glass
windows
of
the
verandah
peasants
stopped
a
moment
on
their
way
home
from
the
to
peer
hibbert
thought
laughingly
of
that
conflict
he
used
to
imagine
he
laughed
because
it
suddenly
seemed
so
unreal
he
belonged
so
utterly
to
nature
and
the
mountains
and
especially
to
those
desolate
slopes
where
now
the
snow
lay
thick
and
fresh
and
sweet
that
there
was
no
question
of
a
conflict
at
all
the
power
of
the
newly
fallen
snow
had
caught
him
proving
it
without
effort
out
there
upon
those
lonely
reaches
of
the
moonlit
ridges
the
snow
lay
ready
masses
and
masses
of
it
cool
soft
inviting
he
longed
for
it
it
awaited
him
he
thought
of
the
intoxicating
delight
of
in
the
moonlight
thus
somehow
in
vivid
flashing
vision
he
thought
of
it
while
he
stood
there
smoking
with
the
other
men
and
talking
all
the
shop
of
and
ever
mysteriously
blended
with
this
power
of
the
snow
poured
also
through
his
inner
being
the
power
of
the
girl
he
could
not
disabuse
his
mind
of
the
insinuating
presence
of
the
two
together
he
remembered
that
queer
of
ten
days
ago
the
impulse
that
had
let
her
in
that
any
mind
even
an
imaginative
one
could
pass
beneath
the
sway
of
such
a
fancy
was
strange
enough
and
hibbert
while
fully
aware
of
the
disorder
yet
found
a
curious
joy
in
yielding
to
it
this
insubordinate
centre
that
drew
him
towards
old
pagan
beliefs
had
assumed
command
with
a
kind
of
sensuous
pleasure
he
let
himself
be
conquered
and
snow
that
night
seemed
in
everybody
thoughts
the
dancing
couples
talked
of
it
the
hotel
proprietors
congratulated
one
another
it
meant
good
sport
and
satisfied
their
guests
every
one
was
planning
trips
and
expeditions
talking
of
slopes
and
telemarks
of
flying
speed
and
distance
of
drifts
and
crust
and
frost
vitality
and
enthusiasm
pulsed
in
the
very
air
all
were
alert
and
active
positive
radiating
currents
of
creative
life
even
into
the
stuffy
atmosphere
of
that
crowded
and
the
snow
had
caused
it
the
snow
had
brought
it
all
this
discharge
of
eager
sparkling
energy
was
due
primarily
to
the
snow
but
in
the
mind
of
hibbert
by
some
swift
alchemy
of
his
pagan
yearnings
this
energy
became
transmuted
it
rarefied
itself
gleaming
in
white
and
crystal
currents
of
passionate
anticipation
which
he
transferred
as
by
a
species
of
electrical
imagination
into
the
personality
of
the
girl
the
girl
of
the
snow
she
somewhere
was
waiting
for
him
expecting
him
calling
to
him
softly
from
those
leagues
of
moonlit
mountain
he
remembered
the
touch
of
that
cool
dry
hand
the
soft
and
icy
breath
against
his
cheek
the
hush
and
softness
of
her
presence
in
the
way
she
came
and
the
way
she
had
gone
again
like
a
flurry
of
snow
the
wind
sent
gliding
up
the
slopes
she
like
himself
belonged
out
there
he
fancied
that
he
heard
her
little
windy
voice
come
sifting
to
him
through
the
snowy
branches
of
the
trees
calling
his
name
that
haunting
little
voice
that
dived
straight
to
the
centre
of
his
life
as
once
long
years
ago
two
other
voices
used
to
do
but
nowhere
among
the
costumed
dancers
did
he
see
her
slender
figure
he
danced
with
one
and
all
distrait
and
absent
a
stupid
partner
as
each
girl
discovered
his
eyes
ever
turning
towards
the
door
and
windows
hoping
to
catch
the
luring
face
the
vision
that
did
not
come
and
at
length
hoping
even
against
hope
for
the
thinned
groups
left
one
by
one
going
home
to
their
hotels
and
chalets
the
band
tired
obviously
people
sat
drinking
at
the
little
tables
the
men
mopping
their
foreheads
everybody
ready
for
bed
it
was
close
on
midnight
as
hibbert
passed
through
the
hall
to
get
his
overcoat
and
he
saw
men
in
the
passage
by
the
greasing
their
ski
against
an
early
start
knapsack
luncheons
were
being
ordered
by
the
kitchen
swing
doors
he
sighed
lighting
a
cigarette
a
friend
offered
him
he
returned
a
confused
reply
to
some
question
as
to
whether
he
could
join
their
party
in
the
morning
it
seemed
he
did
not
hear
it
properly
he
passed
through
the
outer
vestibule
between
the
double
glass
doors
and
went
into
the
night
the
man
who
asked
the
question
watched
him
go
an
expression
of
anxiety
momentarily
in
his
eyes
do
think
he
heard
you
said
another
laughing
you
got
to
shout
to
hibbert
his
mind
so
full
of
his
work
he
works
too
hard
suggested
the
first
full
of
queer
ideas
and
dreams
but
hibbert
silence
was
not
rudeness
he
had
not
caught
the
invitation
that
was
all
the
call
of
the
had
faded
he
no
longer
heard
it
another
wilder
call
was
sounding
in
his
ears
for
up
the
street
he
had
seen
a
little
figure
moving
close
against
the
shadows
of
the
baker
shop
it
glided
white
slim
enticing
vi
and
at
once
into
his
mind
passed
the
hush
and
softness
of
the
snow
yet
with
it
a
searching
crying
wildness
for
the
heights
he
knew
by
some
incalculable
swift
instinct
she
would
not
meet
him
in
the
village
street
it
was
not
there
amid
crowding
houses
she
would
speak
to
him
indeed
already
she
had
disappeared
melted
from
view
up
the
white
vista
of
the
moonlit
road
yonder
he
divined
she
waited
where
the
highway
narrowed
abruptly
into
the
mountain
path
beyond
the
chalets
it
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
hesitate
mad
though
it
seemed
and
was
this
sudden
craving
for
the
heights
with
her
at
least
for
open
spaces
where
the
snow
lay
thick
and
fresh
it
was
too
imperious
to
be
denied
he
does
not
remember
going
up
to
his
room
putting
the
sweater
over
his
evening
clothes
and
getting
into
the
fur
gauntlet
gloves
and
the
helmet
cap
of
wool
most
certainly
he
has
no
recollection
of
fastening
on
his
ski
he
must
have
done
it
automatically
some
faculty
of
normal
observation
was
in
abeyance
as
it
were
his
mind
was
out
beyond
the
village
out
with
the
snowy
mountains
and
the
moon
henri
defago
putting
up
the
shutters
over
his
windows
saw
him
pass
and
wondered
mildly
un
monsieur
qui
fait
du
ski
a
cette
heure
il
est
anglais
done
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
though
a
man
had
the
right
to
choose
his
own
way
of
death
and
marthe
perotti
the
hunchback
wife
of
the
shoemaker
looking
by
chance
from
her
window
caught
his
figure
moving
swiftly
up
the
road
she
had
other
thoughts
for
she
knew
and
believed
the
old
traditions
of
the
witches
and
that
steal
the
souls
of
men
she
had
even
heard
was
said
the
dreaded
synagogue
pass
roaring
down
the
street
at
night
and
now
as
then
she
hid
her
eyes
they
called
to
him
and
he
must
go
she
murmured
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
but
no
one
sought
to
stop
him
hibbert
recalls
only
a
single
incident
until
he
found
himself
beyond
the
houses
searching
for
her
along
the
fringe
of
forest
where
the
moonlight
met
the
snow
in
a
bewildering
frieze
of
fantastic
shadows
and
the
incident
was
simply
this
that
he
remembered
passing
the
church
catching
the
outline
of
its
tower
against
the
stars
he
was
aware
of
a
faint
sense
of
hesitation
a
vague
uneasiness
came
and
went
jarred
unpleasantly
across
the
flow
of
his
excited
feelings
chilling
exhilaration
he
caught
the
discord
dismissed
it
and
passed
on
the
seduction
of
the
snow
smothered
the
hint
before
he
realised
that
it
had
brushed
the
skirts
of
warning
and
then
he
saw
her
she
stood
there
waiting
in
a
little
clear
space
of
shining
snow
dressed
all
in
white
part
of
the
moonlight
and
the
glistening
background
her
slender
figure
just
discernible
i
waited
for
i
knew
you
would
come
the
silvery
little
voice
of
windy
beauty
floated
down
to
him
you
to
come
i
ready
he
answered
i
knew
it
too
the
world
of
nature
caught
him
to
its
heart
in
those
few
words
the
wonder
and
the
glory
of
the
night
and
snow
life
leaped
within
him
the
passion
of
his
pagan
soul
exulted
rose
in
joy
flowed
out
to
her
he
neither
reflected
nor
considered
but
let
himself
go
like
the
veriest
schoolboy
in
the
wildness
of
first
love
give
me
your
hand
he
cried
i
coming
a
little
farther
on
a
little
higher
came
her
delicious
answer
here
it
is
too
near
the
village
and
the
church
and
the
words
seemed
wholly
right
and
natural
he
did
not
dream
of
questioning
them
he
understood
that
with
this
little
touch
of
civilisation
in
sight
the
familiarity
he
suggested
was
impossible
once
out
upon
the
open
mountains
the
freedom
of
huge
slopes
and
towering
peaks
the
stars
and
moon
to
witness
and
the
wilderness
of
snow
to
watch
they
could
taste
an
innocence
of
happy
intercourse
free
from
the
dead
conventions
that
imprison
literal
minds
he
urged
his
pace
yet
did
not
quite
overtake
her
the
girl
kept
always
just
a
little
bit
ahead
of
his
best
efforts
and
soon
they
left
the
trees
behind
and
passed
on
to
the
enormous
slopes
of
the
sea
of
snow
that
rolled
in
mountainous
terror
and
beauty
to
the
stars
the
wonder
of
the
white
world
caught
him
away
under
the
steady
moonlight
it
was
more
than
haunting
it
was
a
living
white
bewildering
power
that
deliciously
confused
the
senses
and
laid
a
spell
of
wild
perplexity
upon
the
heart
it
was
a
personality
that
cloaked
and
yet
revealed
itself
through
all
this
sheeted
whiteness
of
snow
it
rose
went
with
him
fled
before
and
followed
after
slowly
it
dropped
lithe
gleaming
arms
about
his
neck
gathering
him
in
certainly
some
soft
persuasion
coaxed
his
very
soul
urging
him
ever
forwards
upwards
on
towards
the
higher
icy
slopes
judgment
and
reason
left
their
throne
it
seemed
completely
as
in
the
madness
of
intoxication
the
girl
slim
and
seductive
kept
always
just
ahead
so
that
he
never
quite
came
up
with
her
he
saw
the
white
enchantment
of
her
face
and
figure
something
that
streamed
about
her
neck
flying
like
a
wreath
of
snow
in
the
wind
and
heard
the
alluring
accents
of
her
whispering
voice
that
called
from
time
to
time
a
little
farther
on
a
little
higher
then
we
run
home
together
sometimes
he
saw
her
hand
stretched
out
to
find
his
own
but
each
time
just
as
he
came
up
with
her
he
saw
her
still
in
front
the
hand
and
arm
withdrawn
they
took
a
gentle
angle
of
ascent
the
toil
seemed
nothing
in
this
crystal
air
fatigue
vanished
the
sishing
of
the
ski
through
the
powdery
surface
of
the
snow
was
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
this
with
his
breathing
and
the
rustle
of
her
skirts
was
all
he
heard
cold
moonshine
snow
and
silence
held
the
world
the
sky
was
black
and
the
peaks
beyond
cut
into
it
like
frosted
wedges
of
iron
and
steel
far
below
the
valley
slept
the
village
long
since
hidden
out
of
sight
he
felt
that
he
could
never
tire
the
sound
of
the
church
clock
rose
from
time
to
time
faintly
through
the
air
more
and
more
distant
give
me
your
hand
it
time
now
to
turn
back
just
one
more
slope
she
laughed
that
ridge
above
us
then
make
for
home
and
her
low
voice
mingled
pleasantly
with
the
purring
of
their
ski
his
own
seemed
harsh
and
ugly
by
comparison
but
i
have
never
come
so
high
before
it
glorious
this
world
of
silent
snow
and
moonlight
and
you
a
child
of
the
snow
i
swear
let
me
come
up
closer
to
see
your
face
and
touch
your
little
hand
her
laughter
answered
him
come
on
a
little
higher
here
we
quite
alone
together
it
magnificent
he
cried
but
why
did
you
hide
away
so
long
looked
and
searched
for
you
in
vain
ever
since
we
skated
he
was
going
to
say
ten
days
ago
but
the
accurate
memory
of
time
had
gone
from
him
he
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
days
or
years
or
minutes
his
thoughts
of
earth
were
scattered
and
confused
you
looked
for
me
in
the
wrong
places
he
heard
her
murmur
just
above
him
you
looked
in
places
where
i
never
go
hotels
and
houses
kill
me
i
avoid
them
she
laughed
a
fine
shrill
windy
little
laugh
i
loathe
them
too
he
stopped
the
girl
had
suddenly
come
quite
close
a
breath
of
ice
passed
through
his
very
soul
she
had
touched
him
but
this
awful
cold
he
cried
out
sharply
this
freezing
cold
that
takes
me
the
wind
is
rising
it
a
wind
of
ice
come
let
us
turn
but
when
he
plunged
forward
to
hold
her
or
at
least
to
look
the
girl
was
gone
again
and
something
in
the
way
she
stood
there
a
few
feet
beyond
and
stared
down
into
his
eyes
so
steadfastly
in
silence
made
him
shiver
the
moonlight
was
behind
her
but
in
some
odd
way
he
could
not
focus
sight
upon
her
face
although
so
close
the
gleam
of
eyes
he
caught
but
all
the
rest
seemed
white
and
snowy
as
though
he
looked
beyond
her
out
into
space
the
sound
of
the
church
bell
came
up
faintly
from
the
valley
far
below
and
he
counted
the
strokes
five
a
sudden
curious
weakness
seized
him
as
he
listened
deep
within
it
was
deadly
yet
somehow
sweet
and
hard
to
resist
he
felt
like
sinking
down
upon
the
snow
and
lying
there
they
had
been
climbing
for
five
hours
it
was
of
course
the
warning
of
complete
exhaustion
with
a
great
effort
he
fought
and
overcame
it
it
passed
away
as
suddenly
as
it
came
we
turn
he
said
with
a
decision
he
hardly
felt
it
will
be
dawn
before
we
reach
the
village
again
come
at
once
it
time
for
home
the
sense
of
exhilaration
had
utterly
left
him
an
emotion
that
was
akin
to
fear
swept
coldly
through
him
but
her
whispering
answer
turned
it
instantly
to
terror
a
terror
that
gripped
him
horribly
and
turned
him
weak
and
unresisting
our
home
is
a
burst
of
wild
high
laughter
loud
and
shrill
accompanied
the
words
it
was
like
a
whistling
wind
the
wind
risen
and
clouds
obscured
the
moon
a
little
higher
where
we
can
not
hear
the
wicked
bells
she
cried
and
for
the
first
time
seized
him
deliberately
by
the
hand
she
moved
was
suddenly
close
against
his
face
again
she
touched
him
and
hibbert
tried
to
turn
away
in
escape
and
so
trying
found
for
the
first
time
that
the
power
of
the
snow
that
other
power
which
does
not
exhilarate
but
deadens
effort
was
upon
him
the
suffocating
weakness
that
it
brings
to
exhausted
men
luring
them
to
the
sleep
of
death
in
her
clinging
soft
embrace
lulling
the
will
and
conquering
all
desire
for
life
this
was
awfully
upon
him
his
feet
were
heavy
and
entangled
he
could
not
turn
or
move
the
girl
stood
in
front
of
him
very
near
he
felt
her
chilly
breath
upon
his
cheeks
her
hair
passed
blindingly
across
his
eyes
and
that
icy
wind
came
with
her
he
saw
her
whiteness
close
again
it
seemed
his
sight
passed
through
her
into
space
as
though
she
had
no
face
her
arms
were
round
his
neck
she
drew
him
softly
downwards
to
his
knees
he
sank
he
yielded
utterly
he
obeyed
her
weight
was
upon
him
smothering
delicious
the
snow
was
to
his
waist
she
kissed
him
softly
on
the
lips
the
eyes
all
over
his
face
and
then
she
spoke
his
name
in
that
voice
of
love
and
wonder
the
voice
that
held
the
accent
of
two
others
both
taken
over
long
ago
by
death
the
voice
of
his
mother
and
of
the
woman
he
had
loved
he
made
one
more
feeble
effort
to
resist
then
realising
even
while
he
struggled
that
this
soft
weight
about
his
heart
was
sweeter
than
anything
life
could
ever
bring
he
let
his
muscles
relax
and
sank
back
into
the
soft
oblivion
of
the
covering
snow
her
wintry
kisses
bore
him
into
sleep
vii
they
say
that
men
who
know
the
sleep
of
exhaustion
in
the
snow
find
no
awakening
on
the
hither
side
of
death
the
hours
passed
and
the
moon
sank
down
below
the
white
world
rim
then
suddenly
there
came
a
little
crash
upon
his
breast
and
neck
and
hibbert
woke
he
slowly
turned
bewildered
heavy
eyes
upon
the
desolate
mountains
stared
dizzily
about
him
tried
to
rise
at
first
his
muscles
would
not
act
a
numbing
aching
pain
possessed
him
he
uttered
a
long
thin
cry
for
help
and
heard
its
faintness
swallowed
by
the
wind
and
then
he
understood
vaguely
why
he
was
only
warm
not
dead
for
this
very
wind
that
took
his
cry
had
built
up
a
sheltering
mound
of
driven
snow
against
his
body
while
he
slept
like
a
curving
wave
it
ran
beside
him
it
was
the
breaking
of
its
edge
that
caused
the
crash
and
the
coldness
of
the
mass
against
his
neck
that
woke
him
dawn
kissed
the
eastern
sky
pale
gleams
of
gold
shot
every
peak
with
splendour
but
ice
was
in
the
air
and
the
dry
and
frozen
snow
blew
like
powder
from
the
surface
of
the
slopes
he
saw
the
points
of
his
ski
projecting
just
below
him
then
he
remembered
it
seems
he
had
just
strength
enough
to
realise
that
could
he
but
rise
and
stand
he
might
fly
with
terrific
impetus
towards
the
woods
and
village
far
beneath
the
ski
would
carry
him
but
if
he
failed
and
fell
how
he
contrived
it
hibbert
never
knew
this
fear
of
death
somehow
called
out
his
whole
available
reserve
force
he
rose
slowly
balanced
a
moment
then
taking
the
angle
of
an
immense
zigzag
started
down
the
awful
slopes
like
an
arrow
from
a
bow
and
automatically
the
splendid
muscles
of
the
practised
and
athlete
saved
and
guided
him
for
he
was
hardly
conscious
of
controlling
either
speed
or
direction
the
snow
stung
face
and
eyes
like
fine
steel
shot
ridge
after
ridge
flew
past
the
summits
raced
across
the
sky
the
valley
leaped
up
with
bounds
to
meet
him
he
scarcely
felt
the
ground
beneath
his
feet
as
the
huge
slopes
and
distance
melted
before
the
lightning
speed
of
that
descent
from
death
to
life
he
took
it
in
four
zigzags
and
it
was
the
turning
at
each
corner
that
nearly
finished
him
for
then
the
strain
of
balancing
taxed
to
the
verge
of
collapse
the
remnants
of
his
strength
slopes
that
have
taken
hours
to
climb
can
be
descended
in
a
short
on
ski
but
hibbert
had
lost
all
count
of
time
quite
other
thoughts
and
feelings
mastered
him
in
that
wild
swift
dropping
through
the
air
that
was
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
for
ever
close
upon
his
heels
came
following
forms
and
voices
with
the
whirling
he
heard
that
little
silvery
voice
of
death
and
laughter
at
his
back
shrill
and
wild
with
the
whistling
of
the
wind
past
his
ears
he
caught
its
pursuing
tones
but
in
anger
now
no
longer
soft
and
coaxing
and
it
was
accompanied
she
did
not
follow
alone
it
seemed
a
host
of
these
flying
figures
of
the
snow
chased
madly
just
behind
him
he
felt
them
furiously
smite
his
neck
and
cheeks
snatch
at
his
hands
and
try
to
entangle
his
feet
and
ski
in
drifts
his
eyes
they
blinded
and
they
caught
his
breath
away
the
terror
of
the
heights
and
snow
and
winter
desolation
urged
him
forward
in
the
maddest
race
with
death
a
human
being
ever
knew
and
so
terrific
was
the
speed
that
before
the
gold
and
crimson
had
left
the
summits
to
touch
the
of
the
lower
glaciers
he
saw
the
friendly
forest
far
beneath
swing
up
and
welcome
him
and
it
was
then
moving
slowly
along
the
edge
of
the
woods
he
saw
a
light
a
man
was
carrying
it
a
procession
of
human
figures
was
passing
in
a
dark
line
laboriously
through
the
snow
and
he
heard
the
sound
of
chanting
instinctively
without
a
second
hesitation
he
changed
his
course
no
longer
flying
at
an
angle
as
before
he
pointed
his
ski
straight
down
the
the
dreadful
steepness
did
not
frighten
him
he
knew
full
well
it
meant
a
crashing
tumble
at
the
bottom
but
he
also
knew
it
meant
a
doubling
of
his
speed
with
safety
at
the
end
for
though
no
definite
thought
passed
through
his
mind
he
understood
that
it
was
the
village
who
carried
that
little
gleaming
lantern
in
the
dawn
and
that
he
was
taking
the
host
to
a
chalet
on
the
lower
slopes
to
some
peasant
he
remembered
her
terror
of
the
church
and
bells
she
feared
the
holy
symbols
there
was
one
last
wild
cry
in
his
ears
as
he
started
a
shriek
of
the
wind
before
his
face
and
a
rush
of
stinging
snow
against
closed
eyelids
and
then
he
dropped
through
empty
space
speed
took
sight
from
him
it
seemed
he
flew
off
the
surface
of
the
world
indistinctly
he
recalls
the
murmur
of
men
voices
the
touch
of
strong
arms
that
lifted
him
and
the
shooting
pains
as
the
ski
were
unfastened
from
the
twisted
ankle
for
when
he
opened
his
eyes
again
to
normal
life
he
found
himself
lying
in
his
bed
at
the
post
office
with
the
doctor
at
his
side
but
for
years
to
come
the
story
of
mad
hibbert
at
night
is
recounted
in
that
mountain
village
he
went
it
seems
up
slopes
and
to
a
height
that
no
man
in
his
senses
ever
tried
before
the
tourists
were
agog
about
it
for
the
rest
of
the
season
and
the
very
same
day
two
of
the
bolder
men
went
over
the
actual
ground
and
photographed
the
slopes
later
hibbert
saw
these
photographs
he
noticed
one
curious
thing
about
them
though
he
did
not
mention
it
to
any
one
there
was
only
a
single
track
i
as
felix
henriot
came
through
the
streets
that
january
night
the
fog
was
stifling
but
when
he
reached
his
little
flat
upon
the
top
floor
there
came
a
sound
of
wind
wind
was
stirring
about
the
world
it
blew
against
his
windows
but
at
first
so
faintly
that
he
hardly
noticed
it
then
with
an
abrupt
rise
and
fall
like
a
wailing
voice
that
sought
to
claim
attention
it
called
him
he
peered
through
the
window
into
the
blurred
darkness
listening
there
is
no
cry
in
the
world
like
that
of
the
homeless
wind
a
vague
excitement
scarcely
to
be
analysed
ran
through
his
blood
the
curtain
of
fog
waved
momentarily
aside
henriot
fancied
a
star
peeped
down
at
him
it
will
change
things
a
bit
at
last
he
sighed
settling
back
into
his
chair
it
will
bring
movement
already
something
in
himself
had
changed
a
restlessness
as
of
that
wandering
wind
woke
in
his
heart
the
desire
to
be
off
and
away
other
things
could
rouse
this
wildness
too
falling
water
the
singing
of
a
bird
an
odour
of
a
glimpse
of
winding
road
but
the
cry
of
wind
always
searching
questioning
travelling
the
world
great
routes
remained
ever
the
high
longing
took
his
mood
in
hand
mid
seven
millions
he
felt
suddenly
lonely
i
will
arise
and
go
now
for
always
night
and
day
i
hear
lake
water
lapping
with
low
sounds
by
the
shore
while
i
stand
on
the
roadway
or
on
the
pavements
gray
i
hear
it
in
the
deep
heart
core
he
murmured
the
words
over
softly
to
himself
the
emotion
that
produced
innisfree
passed
strongly
through
him
he
too
would
be
over
the
hills
and
far
away
he
craved
movement
change
adventure
somewhere
far
from
shops
and
crowds
and
for
a
week
the
fog
had
stifled
london
this
wind
brought
life
where
should
he
go
desire
was
long
his
purse
was
short
he
glanced
at
his
books
letters
newspapers
they
had
no
interest
now
instead
he
listened
the
panorama
of
other
journeys
rolled
in
colour
through
the
little
room
flying
on
one
another
heels
henriot
enjoyed
this
remembered
essence
of
his
travels
more
than
the
travels
themselves
the
crying
wind
brought
so
many
voices
all
of
them
seductive
there
was
a
soft
crashing
of
waves
upon
the
black
sea
shores
where
the
huge
caucasus
beckoned
in
the
sky
beyond
a
rustling
in
the
umbrella
pines
and
cactus
at
marseilles
whence
magic
steamers
start
about
the
world
like
flying
dreams
he
heard
the
plash
of
fountains
upon
mount
ida
slopes
and
the
whisper
of
the
tamarisk
on
marathon
it
was
dawn
once
more
upon
the
ionian
sea
and
he
smelt
the
perfume
of
the
cyclades
islands
melted
in
the
sunshine
and
across
the
dewy
lawns
of
tempe
moistened
by
the
spray
of
many
waterfalls
he
saw
great
heavens
above
the
dancing
of
white
forms
or
was
it
only
mist
the
sunshine
painted
against
pelion
methought
among
the
lawns
together
we
wandered
underneath
the
young
grey
dawn
and
multitudes
of
dense
white
fleecy
clouds
shepherded
by
the
slow
unwilling
wind
and
then
into
his
stuffy
room
slipped
the
singing
perfume
of
a
on
a
ruined
tower
and
with
it
the
sweetness
of
hot
ivy
he
heard
the
yellow
bees
in
the
ivy
bloom
wind
whipped
over
the
open
hills
this
very
wind
that
laboured
drearily
through
the
london
fog
and
he
was
caught
the
darkness
melted
from
the
city
the
fog
whisked
off
into
an
azure
sky
the
roar
of
traffic
turned
into
booming
of
the
sea
there
was
a
whistling
among
cordage
and
the
floor
swayed
to
and
fro
he
saw
a
sailor
touch
his
cap
and
pocket
the
piece
the
syren
hooted
ominous
sound
that
had
started
him
on
many
a
journey
of
adventure
and
the
roar
of
london
became
mere
insignificant
clatter
of
a
child
toy
carriages
he
loved
that
syren
call
there
was
something
deep
and
pitiless
in
it
it
drew
the
wanderers
forth
from
cities
everywhere
leave
your
known
world
behind
you
and
come
with
me
for
better
or
for
worse
the
anchor
is
up
it
is
too
late
to
change
only
beware
you
shall
know
curious
things
and
alone
henriot
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
he
turned
with
sudden
energy
to
the
shelf
of
maps
and
possessions
he
most
valued
in
the
whole
room
he
was
a
soul
careless
of
common
standards
athirst
ever
for
the
new
and
strange
that
the
best
of
having
a
cheap
flat
he
laughed
and
no
ties
in
the
world
i
can
turn
the
key
and
disappear
no
one
cares
or
knows
no
one
but
the
thieving
caretaker
and
he
long
ago
found
out
that
nothing
here
worth
taking
there
followed
then
no
lengthy
indecision
preparation
was
even
shorter
still
he
was
always
ready
for
a
move
and
his
sojourn
in
cities
was
but
while
he
gathered
pennies
for
further
wanderings
an
enormous
very
worn
and
dirty
emerged
speedily
from
the
bottom
of
a
cupboard
in
the
wall
it
was
of
limitless
capacity
the
key
and
padlock
rattled
in
its
depths
cigarette
ashes
covered
everything
while
he
stuffed
it
full
of
ancient
indescribable
garments
and
his
voice
singing
of
those
yellow
bees
in
the
ivy
bloom
mingled
with
the
crying
of
the
rising
wind
about
his
windows
his
restlessness
had
disappeared
by
magic
this
time
however
there
could
be
no
haunted
pelion
nor
shady
groves
of
tempe
for
he
lived
in
sophisticated
times
when
money
markets
regulated
movement
sternly
travelling
was
only
for
the
rich
mere
wanderers
must
pig
it
he
remembered
instead
an
opportune
invitation
to
the
desert
objective
invitation
his
genial
hosts
had
called
it
knowing
his
hatred
of
convention
and
helouan
danced
into
letters
of
brilliance
upon
the
inner
map
of
his
mind
for
egypt
had
ever
held
his
spirit
in
thrall
though
as
yet
he
had
tried
in
vain
to
touch
the
great
buried
soul
of
her
the
excavators
the
egyptologists
the
archaeologists
most
of
all
plastered
her
grey
ancient
face
with
labels
like
hotel
advertisements
on
travellers
portmanteaux
they
told
where
she
had
come
from
last
but
nothing
of
what
she
dreamed
and
thought
and
loved
the
heart
of
egypt
lay
beneath
the
sand
and
the
trifling
robbery
of
little
details
that
poked
forth
from
tombs
and
temples
brought
no
true
revelation
of
her
stupendous
spiritual
splendour
henriot
in
his
youth
had
searched
and
dived
among
what
material
he
could
find
believing
once
or
half
believing
that
the
ceremonial
of
that
ancient
system
veiled
a
weight
of
symbol
that
was
reflected
from
genuine
supersensual
knowledge
the
rituals
now
taken
literally
and
so
pityingly
explained
away
had
once
been
genuine
pathways
of
approach
but
never
yet
and
least
of
all
in
his
previous
visits
to
egypt
itself
had
he
discovered
one
single
person
worthy
of
speech
who
caught
at
his
idea
curious
they
said
then
turned
away
to
go
on
digging
in
the
sand
sand
smothered
her
world
excavators
discovered
skeletons
museums
everywhere
stored
them
grinning
literal
relics
that
told
nothing
but
now
while
he
packed
and
sang
these
hopes
of
enthusiastic
younger
days
stirred
again
because
the
emotion
that
gave
them
birth
was
real
and
true
in
him
through
the
morning
mists
upon
the
nile
an
old
pyramid
bowed
hugely
at
him
across
london
roofs
come
he
heard
its
awful
whisper
beneath
the
ceiling
i
have
things
to
show
you
and
to
tell
he
saw
the
flock
of
them
sailing
the
desert
like
weird
grey
solemn
ships
that
make
no
earthly
port
and
he
imagined
them
as
one
multiple
expressions
of
some
single
unearthly
portent
they
adumbrated
in
mighty
form
dead
symbols
of
some
spiritual
conception
long
vanished
from
the
world
i
must
dream
like
this
he
laughed
or
i
shall
get
and
pack
instead
of
boots
it
looks
like
a
jumble
sale
already
and
he
stood
on
a
heap
of
things
to
wedge
them
down
still
tighter
but
the
pictures
would
not
cease
he
saw
the
kites
circling
high
in
the
blue
air
a
couple
of
white
vultures
flapped
lazily
away
over
shining
miles
felucca
sails
like
giant
wings
emerging
from
the
ground
curved
towards
him
from
the
nile
the
dropped
long
shadows
over
memphis
he
felt
the
delicious
drenching
heat
and
the
khamasin
that
from
nubia
brushed
his
very
cheeks
in
the
little
gardens
the
was
in
bloom
he
smelt
the
desert
grey
sepulchre
of
cancelled
cycles
the
stillness
of
her
interminable
reaches
dropped
down
upon
old
london
the
magic
of
the
sand
stole
round
him
in
its
tempest
and
while
he
struggled
with
that
strange
capacious
sack
the
piles
of
clothing
ran
into
shapes
of
gleaming
bedouin
faces
london
garments
settled
down
with
the
mournful
sound
of
camels
feet
half
dropping
wind
half
water
flowing
underground
sound
that
old
time
has
brought
over
into
modern
life
and
left
a
moment
for
our
wonder
and
perhaps
our
tears
he
rose
at
length
with
the
excitement
of
some
deep
enchantment
in
his
eyes
the
thought
of
egypt
plunged
ever
so
deeply
into
him
carrying
him
into
depths
where
he
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
so
strangely
far
away
it
seemed
yet
indefinably
familiar
he
lost
his
way
a
touch
of
fear
came
with
it
a
sack
like
that
is
the
wonder
of
the
world
he
laughed
again
kicking
the
unwieldy
monster
into
a
corner
of
the
room
and
sitting
down
to
write
the
thrilling
labels
felix
henriot
alexandria
marseilles
but
his
pen
blotted
the
letters
there
was
sand
in
it
he
rewrote
the
words
then
he
remembered
a
dozen
things
he
had
left
out
impatiently
yet
with
confusion
somewhere
he
stuffed
them
in
they
ran
away
into
shifting
heaps
they
disappeared
they
emerged
suddenly
again
it
was
like
packing
hot
dry
flowing
sand
from
the
pockets
of
a
coat
he
had
worn
it
last
summer
down
dorset
way
out
trickled
sand
there
was
sand
in
his
mind
and
thoughts
and
his
dreams
that
night
were
full
of
winds
the
old
sad
winds
of
egypt
and
of
moving
sifting
sand
arabs
and
afreets
danced
amazingly
together
across
dunes
he
could
never
reach
for
he
could
not
follow
fast
enough
something
infinitely
older
than
these
ever
caught
his
feet
and
held
him
back
a
million
tiny
fingers
stung
and
pricked
him
something
flung
a
veil
before
his
eyes
once
it
touched
him
his
face
and
hands
and
neck
stay
here
with
us
he
heard
a
host
of
muffled
voices
crying
but
their
sound
was
smothered
buried
rising
through
the
ground
a
myriad
throats
were
choked
till
at
last
with
a
violent
effort
he
turned
and
seized
it
and
then
the
thing
he
grasped
at
slipped
between
his
fingers
and
ran
easily
away
it
had
a
grey
and
yellow
face
and
it
moved
through
all
its
parts
it
flowed
as
water
flows
and
yet
was
solid
it
was
centuries
old
he
cried
out
to
it
who
are
you
what
is
your
name
i
surely
know
you
but
i
have
forgotten
and
it
stopped
turning
from
far
away
its
great
uncovered
countenance
of
nameless
colouring
he
caught
a
voice
it
rolled
and
boomed
and
whispered
like
the
wind
and
then
he
woke
with
a
curious
shaking
in
his
heart
and
a
little
touch
of
chilly
perspiration
on
the
skin
but
the
voice
seemed
in
the
room
still
close
beside
him
i
am
the
sand
he
heard
before
it
died
away
and
next
he
realised
that
the
glitter
of
paris
lay
behind
him
and
a
steamer
was
taking
him
with
much
unnecessary
motion
across
a
sparkling
sea
towards
alexandria
gladly
he
saw
the
riviera
fade
below
the
horizon
with
its
hard
bright
sunshine
treacherous
winds
and
its
smear
of
rich
conventional
english
all
restlessness
now
had
left
him
true
vagabond
still
at
forty
he
only
felt
the
unrest
and
discomfort
of
life
when
caught
in
the
network
of
routine
and
rigid
streets
no
chance
of
breaking
loose
he
was
off
again
at
last
money
scarce
enough
indeed
but
the
joy
of
wandering
expressing
itself
in
happy
emotions
of
release
every
warning
of
calculation
was
stifled
he
thought
of
the
american
woman
who
walked
out
of
her
long
island
house
one
summer
day
to
look
at
a
passing
sail
and
was
gone
eight
years
before
she
walked
in
again
eight
years
of
roving
travel
he
had
always
felt
respect
and
admiration
for
that
woman
for
felix
henriot
with
his
admixture
of
foreign
blood
was
philosopher
as
well
as
vagabond
a
strong
poetic
and
religious
strain
sometimes
breaking
out
through
fissures
in
his
complex
nature
he
had
seen
much
life
had
read
many
books
the
passionate
desire
of
youth
to
solve
the
world
big
riddles
had
given
place
to
a
resignation
filled
to
the
brim
with
wonder
anything
be
true
nothing
surprised
him
the
most
outlandish
beliefs
for
all
he
knew
might
fringe
truth
somewhere
he
had
escaped
that
cheap
cynicism
with
which
disappointed
men
soothe
their
vanity
when
they
realise
that
an
intelligible
explanation
of
the
universe
lies
beyond
their
powers
he
no
longer
expected
final
answers
for
him
even
the
smallest
journeys
held
the
spice
of
some
adventure
all
minutes
were
loaded
with
enticing
potentialities
and
they
shaped
for
themselves
somehow
a
dramatic
form
it
like
a
story
his
friends
said
when
he
told
his
travels
it
always
was
a
story
but
the
adventure
that
lay
waiting
for
him
where
the
silent
streets
of
little
helouan
kiss
the
great
desert
lips
was
of
a
different
kind
to
any
henriot
had
yet
encountered
looking
back
he
has
often
asked
himself
how
in
the
world
can
i
accept
it
and
perhaps
he
never
yet
has
accepted
it
it
was
sand
that
brought
it
for
the
desert
the
stupendous
thing
that
mothers
little
helouan
produced
it
ii
he
slipped
through
cairo
with
the
same
relief
that
he
left
the
riviera
resenting
its
social
vulgarity
so
close
to
the
imperial
aristocracy
of
the
desert
he
settled
down
into
the
peace
of
soft
and
silent
little
helouan
the
hotel
in
which
he
had
a
room
on
the
top
floor
had
been
formerly
a
khedivial
palace
it
had
the
air
of
a
palace
still
he
felt
himself
in
a
with
lofty
ceilings
cool
and
airy
corridors
spacious
halls
arabs
attended
to
his
wants
white
walls
let
in
light
and
air
without
a
sign
of
heat
there
was
a
feeling
of
a
large
spread
tent
pitched
on
the
very
sand
and
the
wind
that
stirred
the
oleanders
in
the
shady
gardens
also
crept
in
to
rustle
the
palm
leaves
of
his
favourite
corner
seat
through
the
large
windows
where
once
the
khedive
held
high
court
the
sunshine
blazed
upon
vistaed
leagues
of
desert
and
from
his
bedroom
windows
he
watched
the
sun
dip
into
gold
and
crimson
behind
the
swelling
libyan
sands
this
side
of
the
pyramids
he
saw
the
nile
meander
among
palm
groves
and
tilled
fields
across
his
balcony
railings
the
egyptian
stars
trooped
down
beside
his
very
bed
shaping
old
constellations
for
his
dreams
while
to
the
south
he
looked
out
upon
the
vast
untamable
body
of
the
sands
that
carpeted
the
world
for
thousands
of
miles
towards
upper
egypt
nubia
and
the
dread
sahara
itself
he
wondered
again
why
people
thought
it
necessary
to
go
so
far
afield
to
know
the
desert
here
within
half
an
hour
of
cairo
it
lay
breathing
solemnly
at
his
very
doors
for
little
helouan
caught
thus
between
the
shoulders
of
the
libyan
and
arabian
deserts
is
utterly
the
desert
lies
all
round
it
like
a
sea
henriot
felt
he
never
could
escape
from
it
as
he
moved
about
the
island
whose
coasts
are
washed
with
sand
down
each
broad
and
shining
street
the
two
end
houses
framed
a
vista
of
its
dim
immensity
glimpses
of
shimmering
blue
or
purple
there
were
stretches
of
deep
as
well
far
off
upon
its
bosom
the
streets
were
open
channels
of
approach
and
the
eye
ran
down
them
as
along
the
tube
of
a
telescope
laid
to
catch
incredible
distance
out
of
space
through
them
the
desert
reached
in
with
long
thin
feelers
towards
the
village
its
being
flooded
into
helouan
and
over
it
past
walls
and
houses
churches
and
hotels
the
sea
of
desert
pressed
in
silently
with
its
myriad
soft
feet
of
sand
it
poured
in
everywhere
through
crack
and
slit
and
crannie
these
were
reminders
of
possession
and
ownership
and
every
passing
wind
that
lifted
eddies
of
dust
at
the
street
corners
were
messages
from
the
quiet
powerful
thing
that
permitted
helouan
to
lie
and
dream
so
peacefully
in
the
sunshine
mere
artificial
oasis
its
existence
was
temporary
held
on
lease
just
for
centuries
or
so
this
sea
idea
became
insistent
for
in
certain
lights
and
especially
in
the
brief
bewildering
dusk
the
desert
rose
swaying
towards
the
small
white
houses
the
waves
of
it
ran
for
fifty
miles
without
a
break
it
was
too
deep
for
foam
or
surface
agitation
yet
it
knew
the
swell
of
tides
and
underneath
flowed
resolute
currents
linking
distance
to
the
centre
these
many
deserts
were
really
one
a
storm
just
retreated
had
tossed
helouan
upon
the
shore
and
left
it
there
to
dry
but
any
morning
he
would
wake
to
find
it
had
been
carried
off
again
into
the
depths
some
fragment
at
least
would
disappear
the
grim
mokattam
hills
were
rollers
that
ever
threatened
to
topple
down
and
submerge
the
sandy
bar
that
men
called
helouan
being
soundless
and
devoid
of
perfume
the
desert
message
reached
him
through
two
senses
only
sight
and
touch
chiefly
of
course
the
former
its
invasion
was
concentrated
through
the
eyes
and
vision
thus
uncorrected
went
what
pace
it
pleased
the
desert
played
with
him
sand
stole
into
his
being
through
the
eyes
and
so
obsessing
was
this
majesty
of
its
close
presence
that
henriot
sometimes
wondered
how
people
dared
their
little
social
activities
within
its
very
sight
and
hearing
how
they
played
golf
and
tennis
upon
reclaimed
edges
of
its
face
picnicked
so
blithely
hard
upon
its
frontiers
and
danced
at
night
while
this
stern
unfathomable
thing
lay
breathing
just
beyond
the
trumpery
walls
that
kept
it
out
the
challenge
of
their
shallow
admiration
seemed
presumptuous
almost
provocative
their
pursuit
of
pleasure
suggested
insolent
indifference
they
ran
hazards
he
felt
for
there
was
no
worship
in
their
vulgar
hearts
with
a
mental
shudder
sometimes
he
watched
the
cheap
tourist
horde
go
laughing
chattering
past
within
view
of
its
ancient
eyes
it
was
like
defying
deity
for
to
his
stirred
imagination
the
sublimity
of
the
desert
dwarfed
humanity
these
people
had
been
wiser
to
choose
another
place
for
the
flaunting
of
their
tawdry
insignificance
any
minute
this
wilderness
huddled
in
grey
annihilation
might
awake
and
notice
them
in
his
own
hotel
were
several
smart
society
people
who
emphasised
the
protest
in
him
to
the
point
of
definite
contempt
overdressed
the
latest
worldly
novel
under
their
arms
they
strutted
the
narrow
pavements
of
their
tiny
world
immensely
pleased
with
themselves
their
vacuous
minds
expressed
themselves
in
the
slang
of
their
exclusive
circle
value
being
the
element
excluded
the
pettiness
of
their
outlook
hardly
distressed
him
he
was
too
familiar
with
it
at
home
but
their
essential
vulgarity
their
innate
ugliness
seemed
more
than
usually
offensive
in
the
grandeur
of
its
present
setting
into
the
mighty
sands
they
took
the
latest
london
scandal
gabbling
it
over
even
among
the
tombs
and
temples
and
it
was
to
laugh
the
pains
they
spent
wondering
whom
they
might
condescend
to
know
never
dreaming
that
they
themselves
were
not
worth
knowing
against
the
background
of
the
noble
desert
their
titles
seemed
the
cap
and
bells
of
clowns
and
henriot
knowing
some
of
them
personally
could
not
always
escape
their
insipid
company
yet
he
was
the
gainer
they
little
guessed
how
their
commonness
heightened
contrast
set
mercilessly
thus
beside
the
strange
eternal
beauty
of
the
sand
occasionally
the
protest
in
his
soul
betrayed
itself
in
words
which
of
course
they
did
not
understand
he
is
so
clever
is
he
and
then
having
relieved
his
feelings
he
would
comfort
himself
characteristically
the
desert
has
not
noticed
them
the
sand
is
not
aware
of
their
existence
how
should
the
sea
take
note
of
rubbish
that
lies
above
its
for
henriot
drew
near
to
its
great
shifting
altars
in
an
attitude
of
worship
the
wilderness
made
him
kneel
in
heart
its
shining
reaches
led
to
the
oldest
temple
in
the
world
and
every
journey
that
he
made
was
like
a
sacrament
for
him
the
desert
was
a
consecrated
place
it
was
sacred
and
his
tactful
hosts
knowing
his
peculiarities
left
their
house
open
to
him
when
he
cared
to
come
they
lived
upon
the
northern
edge
of
the
oasis
and
he
was
as
free
as
though
he
were
absolutely
alone
he
blessed
them
he
rejoiced
that
he
had
come
little
helouan
accepted
him
the
desert
knew
that
he
was
there
from
his
corner
of
the
big
he
could
see
the
other
guests
but
his
roving
eye
always
returned
to
the
figure
of
a
solitary
man
who
sat
at
an
adjoining
table
and
whose
personality
stirred
his
interest
while
affecting
to
look
elsewhere
he
studied
him
as
closely
as
might
be
there
was
something
about
the
stranger
that
touched
his
curiosity
a
certain
air
of
expectation
that
he
wore
but
it
was
more
than
that
it
was
anticipation
apprehension
in
it
somewhere
the
man
was
nervous
uneasy
his
restless
way
of
suddenly
looking
about
him
proved
it
henriot
tried
every
one
else
in
the
room
as
well
but
though
his
thought
settled
on
others
too
he
always
came
back
to
the
figure
of
this
solitary
being
opposite
who
ate
his
dinner
as
if
afraid
of
being
seen
and
glanced
up
sometimes
as
if
fearful
of
being
watched
curiosity
before
he
knew
it
became
suspicion
there
was
mystery
here
the
table
he
noticed
was
laid
for
two
is
he
an
actor
a
priest
of
some
strange
religion
an
enquiry
agent
or
just
a
crank
was
the
thought
that
first
occurred
to
him
and
the
question
suggested
itself
without
amusement
the
impression
of
subterfuge
and
caution
he
conveyed
left
his
observer
unsatisfied
the
face
was
clean
shaven
dark
and
strong
thick
hair
straight
yet
bushy
was
slightly
unkempt
it
was
streaked
with
grey
and
an
unexpected
mobility
when
he
smiled
ran
over
the
features
that
he
seemed
to
hold
rigid
by
deliberate
effort
the
man
was
cut
to
no
quite
common
measure
henriot
jumped
to
an
intuitive
conclusion
he
not
here
for
pleasure
or
merely
something
serious
has
brought
him
out
to
egypt
for
the
face
combined
too
qualities
an
obstinate
tenacity
that
might
even
mean
brutality
and
was
certainly
repulsive
yet
with
it
an
undecipherable
dreaminess
betrayed
by
lines
of
the
mouth
but
above
all
in
the
very
light
blue
eyes
so
rarely
raised
those
eyes
he
felt
had
looked
upon
unusual
things
dreaminess
was
not
an
adequate
description
searching
conveyed
it
better
the
true
source
of
the
queer
impression
remained
elusive
and
hence
perhaps
the
incongruous
marriage
in
the
face
mobility
laid
upon
a
foundation
underneath
the
face
showed
conflict
and
henriot
watching
him
felt
decidedly
intrigued
i
like
to
know
that
man
and
all
about
him
his
name
he
learned
later
was
richard
vance
from
birmingham
a
business
man
but
it
was
not
the
birmingham
he
wished
to
know
it
was
the
other
cause
of
the
elusive
dreamy
searching
though
facing
one
another
at
so
short
a
distance
their
eyes
however
did
not
meet
and
this
henriot
well
knew
was
a
sure
sign
that
he
himself
was
also
under
observation
richard
vance
from
birmingham
was
equally
taking
careful
note
of
felix
henriot
from
london
thus
he
could
wait
his
time
they
would
come
together
later
an
opportunity
would
certainly
present
itself
the
first
links
in
a
curious
chain
had
already
caught
soon
the
chain
would
tighten
pull
as
though
by
chance
and
bring
their
lives
into
one
and
the
same
circle
wondering
in
particular
for
what
kind
of
a
companion
the
second
cover
was
laid
henriot
felt
certain
that
their
eventual
coming
together
was
inevitable
he
possessed
this
kind
of
divination
from
first
impressions
and
not
uncommonly
it
proved
correct
following
instinct
therefore
he
took
no
steps
towards
acquaintance
and
for
several
days
owing
to
the
fact
that
he
dined
frequently
with
his
hosts
he
saw
nothing
more
of
richard
vance
the
business
man
from
birmingham
then
one
night
coming
home
late
from
his
friend
house
he
had
passed
along
the
great
corridor
and
was
actually
a
step
or
so
into
his
bedroom
when
a
drawling
voice
sounded
close
behind
him
it
was
an
unpleasant
sound
it
was
very
near
him
too
i
beg
your
pardon
but
have
you
by
any
chance
such
a
thing
as
a
compass
you
could
lend
me
the
voice
was
so
close
that
he
started
vance
stood
within
touching
distance
of
his
body
he
had
stolen
up
like
a
ghostly
arab
must
have
followed
him
too
some
little
distance
for
further
down
the
passage
the
light
of
an
open
door
he
had
passed
it
on
his
way
showed
where
he
came
from
eh
i
beg
your
pardon
a
compass
did
you
say
he
felt
disconcerted
for
a
moment
how
short
the
man
was
now
that
he
saw
him
standing
broad
and
powerful
too
henriot
looked
down
upon
his
thick
head
of
hair
the
personality
and
voice
repelled
him
possibly
his
face
caught
unawares
betrayed
this
forgive
my
startling
you
said
the
other
apologetically
while
the
softer
expression
danced
in
for
a
moment
and
disorganised
the
rigid
set
of
the
face
the
soft
carpet
you
know
i
afraid
you
did
hear
my
tread
i
wondered
he
smiled
again
slightly
at
the
nature
of
the
request
if
by
any
chance
you
had
a
pocket
compass
you
could
lend
me
ah
a
compass
yes
please
do
apologise
i
believe
i
have
one
if
you
wait
a
moment
come
in
wo
you
i
have
a
look
the
other
thanked
him
but
waited
in
the
passage
henriot
it
so
happened
had
a
compass
and
produced
it
after
a
moment
search
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
you
if
i
may
return
it
in
the
morning
you
will
forgive
my
disturbing
you
at
such
an
hour
my
own
is
broken
and
i
wanted
er
to
find
the
true
north
henriot
stammered
some
reply
and
the
man
was
gone
it
was
all
over
in
a
minute
he
locked
his
door
and
sat
down
in
his
chair
to
think
the
little
incident
had
upset
him
though
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
imagine
why
it
ought
by
rights
to
have
been
almost
ludicrous
yet
instead
it
was
the
exact
reverse
half
threatening
why
should
not
a
man
want
a
compass
but
again
why
should
he
and
at
midnight
the
voice
the
eyes
the
near
presence
what
did
they
bring
that
set
his
nerves
thus
asking
unusual
questions
this
strange
impression
that
something
grave
was
happening
something
unearthly
how
was
it
born
exactly
the
man
proximity
came
like
a
shock
it
had
made
him
start
he
brought
thus
the
idea
came
unbidden
to
his
mind
something
with
him
that
galvanised
him
quite
absurdly
as
fear
does
or
delight
or
great
wonder
there
was
a
music
in
his
voice
too
a
certain
well
he
could
only
call
it
lilt
that
reminded
him
of
plainsong
intoning
chanting
drawling
was
the
word
at
all
he
tried
to
dismiss
it
as
imagination
but
it
would
not
be
dismissed
the
disturbance
in
himself
was
caused
by
something
not
imaginary
but
real
and
then
for
the
first
time
he
discovered
that
the
man
had
brought
a
faint
elusive
suggestion
of
perfume
with
him
an
aromatic
odour
that
made
him
think
of
priests
and
churches
the
ghost
of
it
still
lingered
in
the
air
ah
here
then
was
the
origin
of
the
notion
that
his
voice
had
chanted
it
was
surely
the
suggestion
of
incense
but
incense
intoning
a
compass
to
find
the
true
north
at
midnight
in
a
desert
hotel
a
touch
of
uneasiness
ran
through
the
curiosity
and
excitement
that
he
felt
and
he
undressed
for
bed
confound
my
old
imagination
he
thought
what
tricks
it
plays
me
it
keep
me
awake
but
the
questions
once
started
in
his
mind
continued
he
must
find
explanation
of
one
kind
or
another
before
he
could
lie
down
and
sleep
and
he
found
it
at
length
in
the
stars
the
man
was
an
astronomer
of
sorts
possibly
an
astrologer
into
the
bargain
why
not
the
stars
were
wonderful
above
helouan
was
there
not
an
observatory
on
the
mokattam
hills
too
where
tourists
could
use
the
telescopes
on
privileged
days
he
had
it
at
last
he
even
stole
out
on
to
his
balcony
to
see
if
the
stranger
perhaps
was
looking
through
some
wonderful
apparatus
at
the
heavens
their
rooms
were
on
the
same
side
but
the
shuttered
windows
revealed
no
stooping
figure
with
eyes
glued
to
a
telescope
the
stars
blinked
in
their
many
thousands
down
upon
the
silent
desert
the
night
held
neither
sound
nor
movement
there
was
a
cool
breeze
blowing
across
the
nile
from
the
lybian
sands
it
nipped
and
he
stepped
back
quickly
into
the
room
again
drawing
the
mosquito
curtains
carefully
about
the
bed
he
put
the
light
out
and
turned
over
to
sleep
and
sleep
came
quickly
contrary
to
his
expectations
though
it
was
a
light
and
surface
sleep
that
last
glimpse
of
the
darkened
desert
lying
beneath
the
egyptian
stars
had
touched
him
with
some
hand
of
awful
power
that
ousted
the
first
lesser
excitement
it
calmed
and
soothed
him
in
one
sense
yet
in
another
a
sense
he
could
not
understand
it
caught
him
in
a
net
of
deep
deep
feelings
whose
mesh
while
infinitely
delicate
was
utterly
stupendous
his
nerves
this
deeper
emotion
left
alone
it
reached
instead
to
something
infinite
in
him
that
mere
nerves
could
neither
deal
with
nor
interpret
the
soul
awoke
and
whispered
in
him
while
his
body
slept
and
the
little
foolish
dreams
that
ran
to
and
fro
across
this
veil
of
surface
sleep
brought
oddly
tangled
pictures
of
things
quite
tiny
and
at
the
same
time
of
others
that
were
mighty
beyond
words
with
these
two
counters
nightmare
played
they
interwove
there
was
the
figure
of
this
man
with
the
compass
measuring
the
sky
to
find
the
true
north
and
there
were
hints
of
giant
presences
that
hovered
just
outside
some
curious
outline
that
he
traced
upon
the
ground
copied
in
some
nightmare
fashion
from
the
heavens
the
excitement
caused
by
his
visitor
singular
request
mingled
with
the
profounder
sensations
his
final
look
at
the
stars
and
desert
stirred
the
two
were
somehow
some
hours
later
before
this
surface
sleep
passed
into
genuine
slumber
henriot
woke
with
an
appalling
feeling
that
the
desert
had
come
creeping
into
his
room
and
now
stared
down
upon
him
where
he
lay
in
bed
the
wind
was
crying
audibly
about
the
walls
outside
a
faint
sharp
tapping
came
against
the
window
panes
he
sprang
instantly
out
of
bed
not
yet
awake
enough
to
feel
actual
alarm
yet
with
the
nightmare
touch
still
close
enough
to
cause
a
sort
of
feverish
loose
bewilderment
he
switched
the
lights
on
a
moment
later
he
knew
the
meaning
of
that
curious
tapping
for
the
rising
wind
was
flinging
tiny
specks
of
sand
against
the
glass
the
idea
that
they
had
summoned
him
belonged
of
course
to
dream
he
opened
the
window
and
stepped
out
on
to
the
balcony
the
stone
was
very
cold
under
his
bare
feet
there
was
a
wash
of
wind
all
over
him
he
saw
the
sheet
of
glimmering
pale
desert
near
and
far
and
something
stung
his
skin
below
the
eyes
the
sand
he
whispered
again
the
sand
always
the
sand
waking
or
sleeping
the
sand
is
everywhere
nothing
but
sand
sand
sand
he
rubbed
his
eyes
it
was
like
talking
in
his
sleep
talking
to
someone
who
had
questioned
him
just
before
he
woke
but
was
he
really
properly
awake
it
seemed
next
day
that
he
had
dreamed
it
something
enormous
with
rustling
skirts
of
sand
had
just
retreated
far
into
the
desert
sand
went
with
it
flowing
trailing
smothering
the
world
the
wind
died
down
and
henriot
went
back
to
sleep
caught
instantly
away
into
unconsciousness
covered
blinded
swept
over
by
this
spreading
thing
of
reddish
brown
with
the
great
grey
face
whose
being
was
colossal
yet
quite
tiny
and
whose
fingers
wings
and
eyes
were
countless
as
the
stars
but
all
night
long
it
watched
and
waited
rising
to
peer
above
the
little
balcony
and
sometimes
entering
the
room
and
piling
up
beside
his
very
pillow
he
dreamed
of
sand
iii
for
some
days
henriot
saw
little
of
the
man
who
came
from
birmingham
and
pushed
curiosity
to
a
climax
by
asking
for
a
compass
in
the
middle
of
the
night
for
one
thing
he
was
a
good
deal
with
his
friends
upon
the
other
side
of
helouan
and
for
another
he
slept
several
nights
in
the
desert
he
loved
the
gigantic
peace
the
desert
gave
him
the
world
was
forgotten
there
and
not
the
world
merely
but
all
memory
of
it
everything
faded
out
the
soul
turned
inwards
upon
itself
an
arab
boy
and
donkey
took
out
food
and
water
to
the
wadi
hof
a
desolate
gorge
about
an
hour
eastwards
it
winds
between
cliffs
whose
summits
rise
some
thousand
feet
above
the
sea
it
opens
suddenly
cut
deep
into
the
swaying
world
of
level
plateaux
and
undulating
hills
it
moves
about
too
he
never
found
it
in
the
same
place
twice
like
an
arm
of
the
desert
that
shifted
with
the
changing
lights
here
he
watched
dawns
and
sunsets
slept
through
the
heat
and
enjoyed
the
unearthly
colouring
that
swept
day
and
night
across
the
huge
horizons
in
solitude
the
desert
soaked
down
into
him
at
night
the
jackals
cried
in
the
darkness
round
his
camp
fire
small
because
wood
had
to
be
carried
and
in
the
kites
circled
overhead
to
inspect
him
and
an
occasional
white
vulture
flapped
across
the
blue
the
weird
desolation
of
this
rocky
valley
he
thought
was
like
the
scenery
of
the
moon
he
took
no
watch
with
him
and
the
arrival
of
the
donkey
boy
an
hour
after
sunrise
came
almost
from
another
planet
bringing
things
of
time
and
common
life
out
of
some
distant
gulf
where
they
had
lain
forgotten
among
lost
ages
the
short
hour
of
twilight
brought
too
a
bewitchment
into
the
silence
that
was
a
little
less
than
comfortable
full
light
or
darkness
he
could
manage
but
this
time
of
half
things
made
him
want
to
shut
his
eyes
and
hide
its
effect
stepped
over
imagination
the
mind
got
lost
he
could
not
understand
it
for
the
cliffs
and
boulders
of
discoloured
limestone
shone
then
with
an
inward
glow
that
signalled
to
the
desert
with
veiled
lanterns
the
misshappen
hills
carved
by
wind
and
rain
into
ominous
outlines
stirred
and
nodded
in
the
morning
light
they
retired
into
themselves
asleep
but
at
dusk
the
tide
retreated
they
rose
from
the
sea
emerging
naked
threatening
they
ran
together
and
joined
shoulders
the
entire
army
of
them
and
the
glow
of
their
sandy
bodies
continued
even
beneath
the
stars
only
the
moonlight
drowned
it
for
the
moonrise
over
the
mokattam
hills
brought
a
white
grand
loveliness
that
drenched
the
entire
desert
it
drew
a
marvellous
sweetness
from
the
sand
it
shone
across
a
world
as
yet
unfinished
whereon
no
life
might
show
itself
for
ages
yet
to
come
he
was
alone
then
upon
an
empty
star
before
the
creation
of
things
that
breathed
and
moved
what
impressed
him
however
more
than
everything
else
was
the
enormous
vitality
that
rose
out
of
all
this
apparent
death
there
was
no
hint
of
the
melancholy
that
belongs
commonly
to
flatness
the
sadness
of
wide
monotonous
landscape
was
not
here
the
endless
repetition
of
sweeping
vale
and
plateau
brought
infinity
within
measurable
comprehension
he
grasped
a
definite
meaning
in
the
phrase
world
without
end
the
desert
had
no
end
and
no
beginning
it
gave
him
a
sense
of
eternal
peace
the
silent
peace
that
know
instead
of
subduing
the
soul
with
bewilderment
it
inspired
with
courage
confidence
hope
through
this
sand
which
was
the
wreck
of
countless
geological
ages
rushed
life
that
was
terrific
and
uplifting
too
huge
to
include
melancholy
too
deep
to
betray
itself
in
movement
here
was
the
stillness
of
eternity
behind
the
spread
grey
masque
of
apparent
death
lay
stores
of
accumulated
life
ready
to
break
forth
at
any
point
in
the
desert
he
felt
himself
absolutely
royal
and
this
contrast
of
life
veiling
itself
in
death
was
a
contradiction
that
somehow
intoxicated
the
desert
exhilaration
never
left
him
he
was
never
alone
a
companionship
of
millions
went
with
him
and
he
the
desert
close
as
stars
are
close
to
one
another
or
grains
of
sand
it
was
the
khamasin
the
hot
wind
bringing
sand
that
drove
him
in
with
the
feeling
that
these
few
days
and
nights
had
been
immeasurable
and
that
he
had
been
away
a
thousand
years
he
came
back
with
the
magic
of
the
desert
in
his
blood
tasteless
and
insipid
by
comparison
to
human
impressions
thus
he
was
fresh
and
vividly
sensitive
his
being
cleaned
and
sensitized
by
pure
grandeur
felt
people
for
a
time
at
any
rate
with
an
uncommon
sharpness
of
receptive
judgment
he
returned
to
a
life
somehow
mean
and
meagre
resuming
insignificance
with
his
dinner
jacket
out
with
the
sand
he
had
been
regal
now
like
a
slave
he
strutted
and
reduced
but
this
imperial
standard
of
the
desert
stayed
a
little
time
beside
him
its
purity
focussing
judgment
like
a
lens
the
specks
of
smaller
emotions
left
it
clear
at
first
and
as
his
eye
wandered
vaguely
over
the
people
assembled
in
the
it
was
arrested
with
a
vivid
shock
upon
two
figures
at
the
little
table
facing
him
he
had
forgotten
vance
the
birmingham
man
who
sought
the
north
at
midnight
with
a
pocket
compass
he
now
saw
him
again
with
an
intuitive
discernment
entirely
fresh
before
memory
brought
up
her
clouding
associations
some
brilliance
flashed
a
light
upon
him
that
man
henriot
thought
might
have
come
with
me
he
would
have
understood
and
loved
it
but
the
thought
was
really
this
a
moment
reflection
spread
it
rather
he
belongs
somewhere
to
the
desert
the
desert
brought
him
out
here
and
again
hidden
swiftly
behind
it
like
a
movement
running
below
water
what
does
he
want
with
it
what
is
the
deeper
motive
he
conceals
for
there
is
a
deeper
motive
and
it
concealed
but
it
was
the
woman
seated
next
him
who
absorbed
his
attention
really
even
while
this
thought
flashed
and
went
its
way
the
empty
chair
was
occupied
at
last
unlike
his
first
encounter
with
the
man
she
looked
straight
at
him
their
eyes
met
fully
for
several
seconds
there
was
steady
mutual
inspection
while
her
penetrating
stare
intent
without
being
rude
passed
searchingly
all
over
his
face
it
was
disconcerting
crumbling
his
bread
he
looked
equally
hard
at
her
unable
to
turn
away
determined
not
to
be
the
first
to
shift
his
gaze
and
when
at
length
she
lowered
her
eyes
he
felt
that
many
things
had
happened
as
in
a
long
period
of
intimate
conversation
her
mind
had
judged
him
through
and
through
questions
and
answer
flashed
they
were
no
longer
strangers
for
the
rest
of
dinner
though
he
was
careful
to
avoid
direct
inspection
he
was
aware
that
she
felt
his
presence
and
was
secretly
speaking
with
him
she
asked
questions
beneath
her
breath
the
answers
rose
with
the
quickened
pulses
in
his
blood
moreover
she
explained
richard
vance
it
was
this
woman
power
that
shone
reflected
in
the
man
she
was
the
one
who
knew
the
big
unusual
things
vance
merely
echoed
the
rush
of
her
vital
personality
this
was
the
first
impression
that
he
got
from
the
most
striking
curious
face
he
had
ever
seen
in
a
woman
it
remained
very
near
him
all
through
the
meal
she
had
moved
to
his
table
it
seemed
she
sat
beside
him
their
minds
certainly
knew
contact
from
that
moment
it
is
never
difficult
to
credit
strangers
with
the
qualities
and
knowledge
that
oneself
craves
for
and
no
doubt
henriot
active
fancy
went
busily
to
work
but
none
the
less
this
thing
remained
and
grew
that
this
woman
was
aware
of
the
hidden
things
of
egypt
he
had
always
longed
to
know
there
was
knowledge
and
guidance
she
could
impart
her
soul
was
searching
among
ancient
things
her
face
brought
the
desert
back
into
his
thoughts
and
with
it
came
the
sand
here
was
the
flash
the
sight
of
her
restored
the
peace
and
splendour
he
had
left
behind
him
in
his
desert
camps
the
rest
of
course
was
what
his
imagination
constructed
upon
this
slender
basis
only
not
all
of
it
was
imagination
now
henriot
knew
little
enough
of
women
and
had
no
pose
of
understanding
them
his
experience
was
of
the
slightest
the
love
and
veneration
felt
for
his
own
mother
had
set
the
entire
sex
upon
the
heights
his
affairs
with
women
if
so
they
may
be
called
had
been
transient
all
but
those
of
early
youth
which
having
never
known
the
devastating
test
of
fulfilment
still
remained
ideal
and
superb
there
was
unconscious
humour
in
his
attitude
from
a
distance
for
he
regarded
women
with
wonder
and
respect
as
puzzles
that
sweetened
but
complicated
life
might
even
endanger
it
he
certainly
was
not
a
marrying
man
but
now
as
he
felt
the
presence
of
this
woman
so
deliberately
possess
him
there
came
over
him
two
clear
strong
messages
each
vivid
with
certainty
one
was
that
banal
suggestion
of
familiarity
claimed
by
lovers
and
the
like
he
had
often
heard
of
it
i
have
known
that
woman
before
i
have
met
her
ages
ago
somewhere
she
is
strangely
familiar
to
me
and
the
other
growing
out
of
it
almost
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
she
will
bring
you
trouble
and
confusion
avoid
her
and
be
warned
in
fact
a
distinct
presentiment
yet
although
henriot
dismissed
both
impressions
as
having
no
shred
of
evidence
to
justify
them
the
original
clear
judgment
as
he
studied
her
extraordinary
countenance
persisted
through
all
denials
the
familiarity
and
the
presentiment
remained
there
also
remained
this
other
an
enormous
imaginative
leap
that
she
could
teach
him
egypt
he
watched
her
carefully
in
a
sense
fascinated
he
could
only
describe
the
face
as
black
so
dark
it
was
with
the
darkness
of
great
age
elderly
was
the
obvious
natural
word
but
elderly
described
the
features
only
the
expression
of
the
face
wore
centuries
nor
was
it
merely
the
eyes
that
betrayed
an
ancient
soul
behind
them
the
entire
presentment
mysteriously
conveyed
it
this
woman
heart
knew
things
the
thought
kept
beating
up
against
him
there
were
oddly
high
that
made
him
think
involuntarily
of
the
pharaoh
ramases
a
square
deep
jaw
and
an
aquiline
nose
that
gave
the
final
touch
of
power
for
the
power
undeniably
was
there
and
while
the
general
effect
had
grimness
in
it
there
was
neither
harshness
nor
any
forbidding
touch
about
it
there
was
an
implacable
sternness
in
the
set
of
lips
and
jaw
and
most
curious
of
all
the
eyelids
over
the
steady
eyes
of
black
were
level
as
a
ruler
this
level
framing
made
the
woman
stare
remarkable
beyond
description
henriot
thought
of
an
idol
carved
in
stone
stone
hard
and
black
with
eyes
that
stared
across
the
sand
into
a
world
of
things
very
far
away
forgotten
of
men
the
face
was
finely
ugly
this
strange
dark
beauty
flashed
flame
about
it
and
as
the
way
ever
was
with
him
henriot
next
fell
to
constructing
the
possible
lives
of
herself
and
her
companion
though
without
much
success
imagination
soon
stopped
dead
she
was
not
old
enough
to
be
vance
mother
and
assuredly
she
was
not
his
wife
his
interest
was
more
than
merely
piqued
it
was
puzzled
uncommonly
what
was
the
contrast
that
made
the
man
seem
beside
her
vile
whence
came
too
the
impression
that
she
exercised
some
strong
authority
though
never
directly
exercised
that
held
him
at
her
mercy
how
did
he
guess
that
the
man
resented
it
yet
did
not
dare
oppose
and
that
apparently
acquiescing
his
will
was
deliberately
held
in
abeyance
and
that
he
waited
sulkily
biding
his
time
there
was
furtiveness
in
every
gesture
and
expression
a
hidden
motive
lurked
in
him
unworthiness
somewhere
he
was
determined
yet
ashamed
he
watched
her
ceaselessly
and
with
such
uncanny
closeness
henriot
imagined
he
divined
all
this
he
leaped
to
the
guess
that
his
expenses
were
being
paid
a
good
deal
more
was
being
paid
besides
she
was
a
rich
relation
from
whom
he
had
expectations
he
was
serving
his
seven
years
ashamed
of
his
servitude
ever
calculating
escape
but
perhaps
no
ordinary
escape
a
faint
shudder
ran
over
him
he
drew
in
the
reins
of
imagination
of
course
the
probabilities
were
that
he
was
hopelessly
astray
one
usually
is
on
such
occasions
but
this
time
it
so
happened
he
was
singularly
right
before
one
thing
only
his
ready
invention
stopped
every
time
this
vileness
this
notion
of
unworthiness
in
vance
could
not
be
negative
merely
a
man
with
that
face
was
no
inactive
weakling
the
motive
he
was
at
such
pains
to
conceal
betraying
its
existence
by
that
very
fact
moved
surely
towards
aggressive
action
disguised
it
never
slept
vance
was
sharply
on
the
alert
he
had
a
plan
deep
out
of
sight
and
henriot
remembered
how
the
man
soft
approach
along
the
carpeted
corridor
had
made
him
start
he
recalled
the
quasi
shock
it
gave
him
he
thought
again
of
the
feeling
of
discomfort
he
had
experienced
next
his
eager
fancy
sought
to
plumb
the
business
these
two
had
together
in
egypt
in
the
desert
for
the
desert
he
felt
convinced
had
brought
them
out
but
here
though
he
constructed
numerous
explanations
another
barrier
stopped
him
because
he
this
woman
was
in
touch
with
that
aspect
of
ancient
egypt
he
himself
had
ever
sought
in
vain
and
not
merely
with
stones
the
sand
had
buried
so
deep
but
with
the
meanings
they
once
represented
buried
so
utterly
by
the
sands
of
later
thought
and
here
being
ignorant
he
found
no
clue
that
could
lead
to
any
satisfactory
result
for
he
possessed
no
knowledge
that
might
guide
him
he
floundered
until
fate
helped
him
and
the
instant
fate
helped
him
the
warning
and
presentiment
he
had
dismissed
as
fanciful
became
real
again
he
hesitated
caution
acted
he
would
think
twice
before
taking
steps
to
form
acquaintance
better
not
thought
whispered
better
leave
them
alone
this
queer
couple
they
after
things
that
wo
do
you
any
good
this
idea
of
mischief
almost
of
danger
in
their
purposes
was
oddly
insistent
for
what
could
possibly
convey
it
but
while
he
hesitated
fate
who
sent
the
warning
pushed
him
at
the
same
time
into
the
circle
of
their
lives
at
first
tentatively
he
might
still
have
escaped
but
soon
urgently
curiosity
led
him
inexorably
towards
the
end
iv
it
was
so
simple
a
manoeuvre
by
which
fate
began
the
innocent
game
the
woman
left
a
couple
of
books
behind
her
on
the
table
one
night
and
henriot
after
a
moment
hesitation
took
them
out
after
her
he
knew
the
titles
house
of
the
and
house
of
the
hidden
both
singular
interpretations
of
the
pyramids
that
once
had
held
his
own
mind
spellbound
their
ideas
had
been
since
disproved
if
he
remembered
rightly
yet
the
titles
were
a
clue
a
clue
to
that
imaginative
part
of
his
mind
that
was
so
busy
constructing
theories
and
had
found
its
stride
loose
sheets
of
paper
covered
with
notes
in
a
minute
handwriting
lay
between
the
pages
but
these
of
course
he
did
not
read
noticing
only
that
they
were
written
round
designs
of
various
kinds
intricate
designs
he
discovered
vance
in
a
corner
of
the
the
woman
had
disappeared
vance
thanked
him
politely
my
aunt
is
so
forgetful
sometimes
he
said
and
took
them
with
a
covert
eagerness
that
did
not
escape
the
other
observation
he
folded
up
the
sheets
and
put
them
carefully
in
his
pocket
on
one
there
was
an
map
crammed
with
detail
that
might
well
have
referred
to
some
portion
of
the
desert
the
points
of
the
compass
stood
out
boldly
at
the
bottom
there
were
involved
geometrical
designs
again
henriot
saw
them
they
exchanged
then
the
commonplaces
of
conversation
but
these
led
to
nothing
further
vance
was
nervous
and
betrayed
impatience
he
presently
excused
himself
and
left
the
lounge
ten
minutes
later
he
passed
through
the
outer
hall
the
woman
beside
him
and
the
pair
of
them
wrapped
up
in
cloak
and
ulster
went
out
into
the
night
at
the
door
vance
turned
and
threw
a
quick
investigating
glance
in
his
direction
there
seemed
a
hint
of
questioning
in
that
glance
it
might
almost
have
been
a
tentative
invitation
but
also
he
wanted
to
see
if
their
exit
had
been
particularly
noticed
and
by
whom
this
briefly
told
was
the
first
manoeuvre
by
which
fate
introduced
them
there
was
nothing
in
it
the
details
were
so
insignificant
so
slight
the
conversation
so
meagre
the
pieces
thus
added
to
imaginative
structure
yet
they
somehow
built
it
up
and
made
it
solid
the
outline
in
his
mind
began
to
stand
foursquare
that
writing
those
designs
the
manner
of
the
man
their
going
out
together
the
final
curious
look
each
and
all
betrayed
points
of
a
hidden
thing
subconsciously
he
was
excavating
their
buried
purposes
the
sand
was
shifting
the
concentration
of
his
mind
incessantly
upon
them
removed
it
grain
by
grain
and
speck
by
speck
tips
of
the
smothered
thing
emerged
presently
a
subsidence
would
follow
with
a
rush
and
light
would
blaze
upon
its
skeleton
he
felt
it
stirring
underneath
his
feet
this
flowing
movement
of
light
dry
sand
it
was
always
sand
then
other
incidents
of
a
similar
kind
came
about
clearing
the
way
to
a
natural
acquaintanceship
henriot
watched
the
process
with
amusement
yet
with
another
feeling
too
that
was
only
a
little
less
than
anxiety
a
keen
observer
no
detail
escaped
him
he
saw
the
forces
of
their
lives
draw
closer
it
made
him
think
of
the
devices
of
young
people
who
desire
to
know
one
another
yet
can
not
get
a
proper
introduction
fate
condescended
to
such
little
tricks
they
wanted
a
third
person
he
began
to
feel
a
third
was
necessary
to
some
plan
they
had
on
hand
and
they
waited
to
see
if
he
could
fill
the
place
this
woman
with
whom
he
had
yet
exchanged
no
single
word
seemed
so
familiar
to
him
well
known
for
years
they
weighed
and
watched
him
wondering
if
he
would
do
none
of
the
devices
were
too
obviously
used
but
at
length
henriot
picked
up
so
many
forgotten
articles
and
heard
so
many
significant
phrases
casually
let
fall
that
he
began
to
feel
like
the
villain
in
a
play
where
the
hero
for
ever
drops
clues
his
enemy
is
intended
to
discover
introduction
followed
inevitably
my
aunt
can
tell
you
she
knows
arabic
perfectly
he
had
been
discussing
the
meaning
of
some
local
name
or
other
with
a
neighbour
after
dinner
and
vance
had
joined
them
the
neighbour
moved
away
these
two
were
left
standing
alone
and
he
accepted
a
cigarette
from
the
other
case
there
was
a
rustle
of
skirts
behind
them
here
she
comes
said
vance
you
will
let
me
introduce
you
he
did
not
ask
for
henriot
name
he
had
already
taken
the
trouble
to
find
it
out
another
little
betrayal
and
another
clue
it
was
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
great
hall
and
henriot
turned
to
see
the
woman
stately
figure
coming
towards
them
across
the
thick
carpet
that
deadened
her
footsteps
she
came
sailing
up
her
black
eyes
fixed
upon
his
face
very
erect
head
upright
shoulders
almost
squared
she
moved
wonderfully
well
there
was
dignity
and
power
in
her
walk
she
was
dressed
in
black
and
her
face
was
like
the
night
he
found
it
impossible
to
say
what
lent
her
this
air
of
impressiveness
and
solemnity
that
was
almost
majestic
but
there
this
touch
of
darkness
and
of
power
in
the
way
she
came
that
made
him
think
of
some
figure
of
stone
some
idol
motionless
in
all
its
parts
but
moving
as
a
whole
and
gliding
across
sand
beneath
those
level
lids
her
eyes
stared
hard
at
him
and
a
faint
sensation
of
distress
stirred
in
him
deep
deep
down
where
had
he
seen
those
eyes
before
he
bowed
as
she
joined
them
and
vance
led
the
way
to
the
armchairs
in
a
corner
of
the
lounge
the
meeting
as
the
talk
that
followed
he
felt
were
all
part
of
a
preconceived
plan
it
had
happened
before
the
woman
that
is
was
familiar
to
him
to
some
part
of
his
being
that
had
dropped
stitches
of
old
old
memory
lady
statham
at
first
the
name
had
disappointed
him
so
many
folk
wear
titles
as
syllables
in
certain
tongues
wear
accents
without
them
being
mute
unnoticed
unpronounced
nonentities
born
to
names
so
often
claim
attention
for
their
insignificance
in
this
way
but
this
woman
had
she
been
jemima
jones
would
have
made
the
name
distinguished
and
select
she
was
a
big
and
sombre
personality
why
was
it
he
wondered
afterwards
that
for
a
moment
something
in
him
shrank
and
that
his
mind
metaphorically
speaking
flung
up
an
arm
in
the
instinct
flashed
and
passed
but
it
seemed
to
him
born
of
an
automatic
feeling
that
he
must
protect
not
himself
but
the
woman
from
the
man
there
was
confusion
in
it
all
links
were
missing
he
studied
her
intently
she
was
a
woman
who
had
none
of
the
external
feminine
signals
in
either
dress
or
manner
no
graces
no
little
womanly
hesitations
and
alarms
no
daintiness
yet
neither
anything
distinctly
masculine
her
charm
was
strong
possessing
only
he
kept
forgetting
that
he
was
talking
to
a
woman
and
the
thing
she
inspired
in
him
included
with
respect
and
wonder
somewhere
also
this
curious
hint
of
dread
this
instinct
to
protect
her
fled
as
soon
as
it
was
born
for
the
interest
of
the
conversation
in
which
she
so
quickly
plunged
him
obliterated
all
minor
emotions
whatsoever
here
for
the
first
time
he
drew
close
to
egypt
the
egypt
he
had
sought
so
long
it
was
not
to
be
explained
he
it
beginning
with
commonplaces
such
as
you
like
egypt
you
find
here
what
you
expected
she
led
him
into
better
regions
with
one
finds
here
what
one
brings
he
knew
the
delightful
experience
of
talking
fluently
on
subjects
he
was
at
home
in
and
to
some
one
who
understood
the
feeling
at
first
that
to
this
woman
he
could
not
say
mere
anythings
slipped
into
its
opposite
that
he
could
say
everything
strangers
ten
minutes
ago
they
were
at
once
in
deep
and
intimate
talk
together
he
found
his
ideas
readily
followed
agreed
with
up
to
a
point
the
point
which
permits
discussion
to
start
from
a
basis
of
general
accord
towards
speculation
in
the
excitement
of
ideas
he
neglected
the
uncomfortable
note
that
had
stirred
his
caution
forgot
the
warning
too
her
mind
moreover
seemed
known
to
him
he
was
often
aware
of
what
she
was
going
to
say
before
he
actually
heard
it
the
current
of
her
thoughts
struck
a
familiar
gait
and
more
than
once
he
experienced
vividly
again
the
odd
sensation
that
it
all
had
happened
before
the
very
sentences
and
phrases
with
which
she
pointed
the
turns
of
her
unusual
ideas
were
never
wholly
unexpected
for
her
ideas
were
decidedly
unusual
in
the
sense
that
she
accepted
without
question
speculations
not
commonly
deemed
worth
consideration
at
all
indeed
not
ordinarily
even
known
henriot
knew
them
because
he
had
read
in
many
fields
it
was
the
strength
of
her
belief
that
fascinated
him
she
offered
no
apologies
she
knew
and
while
he
talked
she
listening
with
folded
arms
and
her
black
eyes
fixed
upon
his
own
richard
vance
watched
with
vigilant
eyes
and
listened
too
ceaselessly
alert
vance
joined
in
little
enough
however
gave
no
opinions
his
attitude
one
of
general
acquiescence
twice
when
pauses
of
slackening
interest
made
it
possible
henriot
fancied
he
surprised
another
quality
in
this
negative
attitude
interpreting
it
each
time
differently
he
yet
dismissed
both
interpretations
with
a
smile
his
imagination
leaped
so
absurdly
to
violent
conclusions
they
were
not
tenable
vance
was
neither
her
keeper
nor
was
he
in
some
fashion
a
detective
yet
in
his
manner
was
sometimes
this
suggestion
of
the
detective
order
he
watched
with
such
deep
attention
and
he
concealed
it
so
clumsily
with
an
affectation
of
careless
indifference
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
that
impulsive
intimacy
strangers
sometimes
adopt
when
an
atmosphere
of
mutual
sympathy
takes
them
by
surprise
for
it
is
akin
to
the
false
frankness
friends
affect
when
telling
candidly
one
another
faults
the
mood
is
invariably
regretted
later
henriot
however
yielded
to
it
now
with
something
like
abandon
the
pleasure
of
talking
with
this
woman
was
so
unexpected
and
so
keen
for
lady
statham
believed
apparently
in
some
egypt
of
her
dreams
her
interest
was
neither
historical
archaeological
nor
political
it
was
religious
yet
hardly
of
this
earth
at
all
the
conversation
turned
upon
the
knowledge
of
the
ancient
egyptians
from
an
unearthly
point
of
view
and
even
while
he
talked
he
was
vaguely
aware
that
it
was
mind
talking
through
his
own
she
drew
out
his
ideas
and
made
him
say
them
but
this
he
was
properly
aware
of
only
afterwards
that
she
had
cleverly
mercilessly
pumped
him
of
all
he
had
ever
known
or
read
upon
the
subject
moreover
what
vance
watched
so
intently
was
himself
and
the
reactions
in
himself
this
remarkable
woman
produced
that
also
he
realised
later
his
first
impression
that
these
two
belonged
to
what
may
be
called
the
crank
order
was
justified
by
the
conversation
but
at
least
it
was
interesting
crankiness
and
the
belief
behind
it
made
it
even
fascinating
long
before
the
end
he
surprised
in
her
a
more
vital
form
of
his
own
attitude
that
anything
be
true
since
knowledge
has
never
yet
found
final
answers
to
any
of
the
biggest
questions
he
understood
from
sentences
dropped
early
in
the
talk
that
she
was
among
those
few
superstitious
folk
who
think
that
the
old
egyptians
came
closer
to
reading
the
eternal
riddles
of
the
world
than
any
others
and
that
their
knowledge
was
a
remnant
of
that
ancient
wisdom
religion
which
existed
in
the
superb
dark
civilization
of
the
sunken
atlantis
lost
continent
that
once
joined
africa
to
mexico
eighty
thousand
years
ago
the
dim
sands
of
poseidonis
great
island
adjoining
the
main
continent
which
itself
had
vanished
a
vast
period
before
sank
down
beneath
the
waves
and
the
entire
known
world
was
descended
from
its
survivors
hence
the
significant
fact
that
all
religions
and
mythological
systems
begin
with
a
story
of
a
flood
some
cataclysmic
upheaval
that
destroyed
the
world
egypt
itself
was
colonised
by
a
group
of
atlantean
priests
who
brought
their
curious
deep
knowledge
with
them
they
had
foreseen
the
cataclysm
lady
statham
talked
well
bringing
into
her
great
dream
this
strong
insistent
quality
of
belief
and
fact
she
knew
from
plato
to
donelly
all
that
the
minds
of
men
have
ever
speculated
upon
the
gorgeous
legend
the
evidence
for
such
a
sunken
continent
henriot
had
skimmed
it
too
in
years
gone
by
she
made
bewilderingly
complete
he
had
heard
baconians
demolish
shakespeare
with
an
array
of
evidence
equally
overwhelming
it
catches
the
imagination
though
not
the
mind
yet
out
of
her
facts
as
she
presented
them
grew
a
strange
likelihood
the
force
of
this
personality
and
her
calm
and
quiet
way
of
believing
all
she
talked
about
took
her
listener
to
some
extent
further
than
ever
before
certainly
into
the
great
dream
after
her
and
the
dream
to
say
the
least
was
a
picturesque
one
laden
with
wonderful
possibilities
for
as
she
talked
the
spirit
of
old
egypt
moved
up
staring
down
upon
him
out
of
eyes
lidded
so
curiously
level
hitherto
all
had
prated
to
him
of
the
arabs
their
ancient
faith
and
customs
and
the
splendour
of
the
bedouins
those
princes
of
the
desert
but
what
he
sought
barely
confessed
in
words
even
to
himself
was
something
older
far
than
this
and
this
strange
dark
woman
brought
it
close
deeps
in
his
soul
long
slumbering
awoke
he
heard
forgotten
questions
only
in
this
brief
way
could
he
attempt
to
sum
up
the
storm
she
roused
in
him
she
carried
him
far
beyond
mere
outline
however
though
afterwards
he
recalled
the
details
with
difficulty
so
much
more
was
suggested
than
actually
expressed
she
contrived
to
make
the
general
modern
scepticism
an
evidence
of
cheap
mentality
it
was
so
easy
the
depth
it
affects
to
conceal
mere
emptiness
we
have
tried
all
things
and
found
all
wanting
the
mind
as
measuring
instrument
merely
confessed
inadequate
various
shrewd
judgments
of
this
kind
increased
his
respect
although
her
acceptance
went
so
far
beyond
his
own
and
while
the
label
of
credulity
refused
to
stick
to
her
her
sense
of
imaginative
wonder
enabled
her
to
escape
that
dreadful
compromise
a
man
mind
in
a
woman
temperament
she
fascinated
him
the
spiritual
worship
of
the
ancient
egyptians
she
held
was
a
symbolical
explanation
of
things
generally
alluded
to
as
the
secrets
of
life
and
death
their
knowledge
was
a
remnant
of
the
wisdom
of
atlantis
material
relics
equally
misunderstood
still
stood
at
karnac
stonehenge
and
in
the
mysterious
writings
on
buried
mexican
temples
and
cities
so
significantly
akin
to
the
hieroglyphics
upon
the
egyptian
tombs
the
one
misinterpreted
as
literally
as
the
other
she
suggested
yet
both
fragments
of
an
advanced
knowledge
that
found
its
grave
in
the
sea
the
wisdom
of
that
old
spiritual
system
has
vanished
from
the
world
only
a
degraded
literalism
left
of
its
undecipherable
language
the
jewel
has
been
lost
and
the
casket
is
filled
with
sand
sand
sand
how
keenly
her
black
eyes
searched
his
own
as
she
said
it
and
how
oddly
she
made
the
little
word
resound
the
syllable
drew
out
almost
into
chanting
echoes
answered
from
the
depths
within
him
carrying
it
on
and
on
across
some
desert
of
forgotten
belief
veils
of
sand
flew
everywhere
about
his
mind
curtains
lifted
whole
hills
of
sand
went
shifting
into
level
surfaces
whence
gardens
of
dim
outline
emerged
to
meet
the
sunlight
but
the
sand
may
be
removed
it
was
her
nephew
speaking
almost
for
the
first
time
and
the
interruption
had
an
odd
effect
introducing
a
sharply
practical
element
for
the
tone
expressed
so
far
as
he
dared
express
it
disapproval
it
was
a
baited
observation
an
invitation
to
opinion
we
are
not
henriot
put
in
lady
statham
before
he
decided
to
respond
our
object
is
quite
another
one
and
i
believe
i
have
a
feeling
she
added
almost
questioningly
that
you
might
be
interested
enough
to
help
us
perhaps
he
only
wondered
the
direct
attack
had
not
come
sooner
its
bluntness
hardly
surprised
him
he
felt
himself
leap
forward
to
accept
it
a
sudden
subsidence
had
freed
his
feet
then
the
warning
operated
suddenly
for
an
instant
henriot
interested
more
he
was
half
seduced
but
as
yet
he
did
not
mean
to
be
included
in
their
purposes
whatever
these
might
be
that
shrinking
dread
came
back
a
moment
and
was
gone
again
before
he
could
question
it
his
eyes
looked
full
at
lady
statham
what
is
it
that
you
know
they
asked
her
tell
me
the
things
we
once
knew
together
you
and
i
these
words
are
merely
trifling
and
why
does
another
man
now
stand
in
my
place
for
the
sands
heaped
upon
my
memory
are
shifting
and
it
is
who
are
moving
them
away
his
soul
whispered
it
his
voice
said
quite
another
thing
although
the
words
he
used
seemed
oddly
chosen
there
is
much
in
the
ideas
of
ancient
egypt
that
has
attracted
me
ever
since
i
can
remember
though
i
have
never
caught
up
with
anything
definite
enough
to
follow
there
was
majesty
somewhere
in
their
conceptions
a
large
calm
majesty
of
spiritual
dominion
one
might
call
it
perhaps
i
interested
her
face
remained
expressionless
as
she
listened
but
there
was
grave
conviction
in
the
eyes
that
held
him
like
a
spell
he
saw
through
them
into
dim
faint
pictures
whose
background
was
always
sand
he
forgot
that
he
was
speaking
with
a
woman
a
woman
who
half
an
hour
ago
had
been
a
stranger
to
him
he
followed
these
faded
mental
pictures
though
he
never
caught
them
up
it
was
like
his
dream
in
london
lady
statham
was
talking
he
had
not
noticed
the
means
by
which
she
effected
the
abrupt
transition
of
familiar
beliefs
of
old
egypt
of
the
ka
or
double
by
whose
existence
the
survival
of
the
soul
was
possible
even
its
return
into
manifested
physical
life
of
the
astrology
or
influence
of
the
heavenly
bodies
upon
all
sublunar
activities
of
terrific
forms
of
other
life
known
to
the
ancient
worship
of
atlantis
great
potencies
that
might
be
invoked
by
ritual
and
ceremonial
and
of
their
lesser
influence
as
recognised
in
certain
lower
forms
hence
treated
with
veneration
as
the
sacred
animal
branch
of
this
dim
religion
and
she
spoke
lightly
of
the
modern
learning
which
so
glibly
imagined
it
was
the
animals
themselves
that
were
looked
upon
as
gods
the
bull
the
bird
the
crocodile
the
cat
it
there
they
all
go
so
absurdly
wrong
she
said
taking
the
symbol
for
the
power
symbolised
yet
natural
enough
the
mind
wears
blinkers
studies
only
the
details
seen
directly
before
it
had
none
of
us
experienced
love
we
should
think
the
first
lover
mad
few
know
the
powers
knew
hence
deny
them
if
the
world
were
deaf
it
would
stand
with
mockery
before
a
hearing
group
swayed
by
an
orchestra
pitying
both
listeners
and
performers
it
would
deem
our
admiration
of
a
great
swinging
bell
mere
foolish
worship
of
form
and
movement
similarly
with
high
powers
that
once
expressed
themselves
in
common
forms
where
best
they
could
being
themselves
bodiless
the
learned
men
classify
the
forms
with
painstaking
detail
but
deity
has
gone
out
of
life
the
powers
symbolised
are
no
longer
experienced
these
powers
you
suggest
then
their
kas
as
it
were
may
still
but
she
waved
aside
the
interruption
they
are
satisfied
as
the
common
people
were
with
a
degraded
literalism
she
went
on
nut
was
the
heavens
who
spread
herself
across
the
earth
in
the
form
of
a
woman
shu
the
vastness
of
space
the
ibis
typified
thoth
and
hathor
was
the
patron
of
the
western
hills
khonsu
the
moon
was
personified
as
was
the
deity
of
the
nile
but
the
high
priest
of
ra
the
sun
you
notice
remained
ever
the
great
one
of
visions
the
high
priest
the
great
one
of
visions
how
wonderfully
again
she
made
the
sentence
sing
she
put
splendour
into
it
the
pictures
shifted
suddenly
closer
in
his
mind
he
saw
the
grandeur
of
memphis
and
heliopolis
rise
against
the
stars
and
shake
the
sand
of
ages
from
their
stern
old
temples
you
think
it
possible
then
to
get
into
touch
with
these
high
powers
you
speak
of
powers
once
manifested
in
common
forms
henriot
asked
the
question
with
a
degree
of
conviction
and
solemnity
that
surprised
himself
the
scenery
changed
about
him
as
he
listened
the
spacious
halls
of
this
former
khedivial
palace
melted
into
desert
spaces
he
smelt
the
open
wilderness
the
sand
that
haunted
helouan
the
arab
servants
moved
across
the
hall
in
their
white
sheets
like
eddies
of
dust
the
wind
stirred
from
the
libyan
dunes
and
over
these
two
strangers
close
beside
him
stole
a
queer
indefinite
alteration
moods
and
emotions
nameless
as
unknown
stars
rose
through
his
soul
trailing
dark
mists
of
memory
from
unfathomable
distances
lady
statham
answered
him
indirectly
he
found
himself
wishing
that
those
steady
eyes
would
sometimes
close
love
is
known
only
by
feeling
it
she
said
her
voice
deepening
a
little
behind
the
form
you
feel
the
person
loved
the
process
is
an
evocation
pure
and
simple
an
arduous
ceremonial
involving
worship
and
devotional
preparation
is
the
means
it
is
a
difficult
ritual
the
only
one
acknowledged
by
the
world
as
still
effectual
ritual
is
the
passage
way
of
the
soul
into
the
infinite
he
might
have
said
the
words
himself
the
thought
lay
in
him
while
she
uttered
it
evocation
everywhere
in
life
was
as
true
as
assimilation
nevertheless
he
stared
his
companion
full
in
the
eyes
with
a
touch
of
almost
rude
amazement
but
no
further
questions
prompted
themselves
or
rather
he
declined
to
ask
them
he
recalled
somehow
uneasily
that
in
ceremonial
the
points
of
the
compass
have
significance
standing
for
forces
and
activities
that
sleep
there
until
invoked
and
a
passing
light
fell
upon
that
curious
midnight
request
in
the
corridor
upstairs
these
two
were
on
the
track
of
undesirable
experiments
he
thought
they
wished
to
include
him
too
you
go
at
night
sometimes
into
the
desert
he
heard
himself
saying
it
was
impulsive
and
miscalculated
his
feeling
that
it
would
be
wise
to
change
the
conversation
resulted
in
giving
it
fresh
impetus
instead
we
saw
you
there
in
the
wadi
hof
put
in
vance
suddenly
breaking
his
long
silence
you
too
sleep
out
then
it
means
you
know
the
valley
of
fear
we
wondered
it
was
lady
statham
voice
and
she
leaned
forward
eagerly
as
she
said
it
then
abruptly
left
the
sentence
incomplete
henriot
started
a
sense
of
momentary
acute
discomfort
again
ran
over
him
the
same
second
she
continued
though
obviously
changing
the
phrase
we
wondered
how
you
spent
your
day
there
during
the
heat
but
you
paint
do
you
you
draw
i
mean
the
commonplace
question
he
realised
in
every
fibre
of
his
being
meant
something
deemed
significant
was
it
his
talent
for
drawing
that
they
sought
to
use
him
for
even
as
he
answered
with
a
simple
affirmative
he
had
a
flash
of
intuition
that
might
be
fanciful
yet
that
might
be
true
that
this
extraordinary
pair
were
intent
upon
some
ceremony
of
evocation
that
should
summon
into
actual
physical
expression
some
power
some
type
of
life
known
long
ago
to
ancient
worship
and
that
they
even
sought
to
fix
its
bodily
outline
with
the
pencil
his
pencil
a
gateway
of
incredible
adventure
opened
at
his
feet
he
balanced
on
the
edge
of
knowing
unutterable
things
here
was
a
clue
that
might
lead
him
towards
the
hidden
egypt
he
had
ever
craved
to
know
an
awful
hand
was
beckoning
the
sands
were
shifting
he
saw
the
million
eyes
of
the
desert
watching
him
from
beneath
the
level
lids
of
centuries
speck
by
speck
and
grain
by
grain
the
sand
that
smothered
memory
lifted
the
countless
wrappings
that
embalmed
it
and
he
was
willing
yet
afraid
why
in
the
world
did
he
hesitate
and
shrink
why
was
it
that
the
presence
of
this
silent
watching
personality
in
the
chair
beside
him
kept
caution
still
alive
with
warning
close
behind
the
pictures
in
his
mind
were
gorgeously
coloured
it
was
richard
vance
who
somehow
streaked
them
through
with
black
a
thing
of
darkness
born
of
this
man
unassertive
presence
flitted
ever
across
the
scenery
marring
its
grandeur
with
something
evil
petty
dreadful
he
held
a
horrible
thought
alive
his
mind
was
thinking
venal
purposes
in
henriot
himself
imagination
had
grown
curiously
heated
fed
by
what
had
been
suggested
rather
than
actually
said
ideas
of
immensity
crowded
his
brain
yet
never
assumed
definite
shape
they
were
familiar
even
as
this
strange
woman
was
familiar
once
long
ago
he
had
known
them
well
had
even
practised
them
beneath
these
bright
egyptian
stars
whence
came
this
prodigious
glad
excitement
in
his
heart
this
sense
of
mighty
powers
coaxed
down
to
influence
the
very
details
of
daily
life
behind
them
for
all
their
vagueness
lay
an
archetypal
splendour
fraught
with
forgotten
meanings
he
had
always
been
aware
of
it
in
this
mysterious
land
but
it
had
ever
hitherto
eluded
him
it
hovered
everywhere
he
had
felt
it
brooding
behind
the
towering
colossi
at
thebes
in
the
skeletons
of
wasted
temples
in
the
uncouth
comeliness
of
the
sphinx
and
in
the
crude
terror
of
the
pyramids
even
over
the
whole
of
egypt
hung
its
invisible
wings
these
were
but
isolated
fragments
of
the
body
that
might
express
it
and
the
desert
remained
its
cleanest
truest
symbol
sand
knew
it
closest
sand
might
even
give
it
bodily
form
and
outline
but
while
it
escaped
description
in
his
mind
as
equally
it
eluded
visualisation
in
his
soul
he
felt
that
it
combined
with
its
vastness
something
infinitely
small
as
well
of
such
wee
particles
is
the
giant
desert
born
henriot
started
nervously
in
his
chair
convicted
once
more
of
unconscionable
staring
and
at
the
same
moment
a
group
of
hotel
people
returning
from
a
dance
passed
through
the
hall
and
nodded
him
the
scent
of
the
women
reached
him
and
with
it
the
sound
of
their
voices
discussing
personalities
just
left
behind
a
london
atmosphere
came
with
them
he
caught
trivial
phrases
uttered
in
a
drawling
tone
and
followed
by
the
shrill
laughter
of
a
girl
they
passed
upstairs
discussing
their
little
things
like
marionettes
upon
a
tiny
stage
but
their
passage
brought
him
back
to
things
of
modern
life
and
to
some
standard
of
familiar
measurement
the
pictures
that
his
soul
had
gazed
at
so
deep
within
he
realised
were
a
pictorial
transfer
caught
incompletely
from
this
woman
vivid
mind
he
had
seen
the
desert
as
the
grey
enormous
tomb
where
hovered
still
the
ka
of
ancient
egypt
sand
screened
her
visage
with
the
veil
of
centuries
but
she
was
there
and
she
was
living
egypt
herself
had
pitched
a
temporary
camp
in
him
and
then
moved
on
there
was
a
momentary
break
a
sense
of
abruptness
and
dislocation
and
then
he
became
aware
that
lady
statham
had
been
speaking
for
some
time
before
he
caught
her
actual
words
and
that
a
certain
change
had
come
into
her
voice
as
also
into
her
manner
v
she
was
leaning
closer
to
him
her
face
suddenly
glowing
and
alive
through
the
stone
figure
coursed
the
fires
of
a
passion
that
deepened
the
eyes
and
communicated
a
hint
of
light
of
exaltation
to
her
whole
person
it
was
incredibly
moving
to
this
deep
passion
was
due
the
power
he
had
felt
it
was
her
entire
life
she
lived
for
it
she
would
die
for
it
her
calmness
of
manner
enhanced
its
effect
hence
the
strength
of
those
first
impressions
that
had
stormed
him
the
woman
had
belief
however
wild
and
strange
it
was
sacred
to
her
the
secret
of
her
influence
was
conviction
his
attitude
shifted
several
points
then
the
wonder
in
him
passed
over
into
awe
the
things
she
knew
were
real
they
were
not
merely
imaginative
speculations
i
knew
i
was
not
wrong
in
thinking
you
in
sympathy
with
this
line
of
thought
she
was
saying
in
lower
voice
steady
with
earnestness
and
as
though
she
had
read
his
mind
you
too
know
though
perhaps
you
hardly
realise
that
you
know
it
lies
so
deep
in
you
that
you
only
get
vague
feelings
of
it
intimations
of
memory
is
that
the
case
henriot
gave
assent
with
his
eyes
it
was
the
truth
what
we
know
instinctively
she
continued
is
simply
what
we
are
trying
to
remember
knowledge
is
memory
she
paused
a
moment
watching
his
face
closely
at
least
you
are
free
from
that
cheap
scepticism
which
labels
these
old
beliefs
as
superstition
it
was
not
even
a
question
i
worship
real
belief
of
any
kind
he
stammered
for
her
words
and
the
close
proximity
of
her
atmosphere
caused
a
strange
upheaval
in
his
heart
that
he
could
not
account
for
he
faltered
in
his
speech
it
is
the
most
vital
quality
in
life
rarer
than
deity
he
was
using
her
own
phrases
even
it
is
creative
it
constructs
the
world
anew
and
may
reconstruct
the
old
she
said
it
lifting
her
face
above
him
a
little
so
that
her
eyes
looked
down
into
his
own
it
grew
big
and
somehow
masculine
it
was
the
face
of
a
priest
spiritual
power
in
it
where
oh
where
in
the
echoing
past
had
he
known
this
woman
soul
he
saw
her
in
another
setting
a
forest
of
columns
dim
about
her
towering
above
giant
aisles
again
he
felt
the
desert
had
come
close
into
this
hall
of
the
hotel
came
the
sifting
of
tiny
sand
it
heaped
softly
about
the
very
furniture
against
his
feet
blocking
the
exits
of
door
and
window
it
shrouded
the
little
present
the
wind
that
brought
it
stirred
a
veil
that
had
hung
for
ages
motionless
she
had
been
saying
many
things
that
he
had
missed
while
his
mind
went
searching
there
were
types
of
life
the
atlantean
system
knew
it
might
revive
life
unmanifested
in
any
bodily
form
was
the
sentence
he
caught
with
his
return
to
the
actual
present
a
type
of
life
he
whispered
looking
about
him
as
though
to
see
who
it
was
had
joined
them
you
mean
a
soul
some
kind
of
soul
alien
to
humanity
or
to
to
any
forms
of
living
thing
in
the
world
what
she
had
been
saying
reached
him
somehow
it
seemed
though
he
had
not
heard
the
words
themselves
still
hesitating
he
was
yet
so
eager
to
hear
already
he
felt
she
meant
to
include
him
in
her
purposes
and
that
in
the
end
he
must
go
willingly
so
strong
was
her
persuasion
on
his
mind
and
he
felt
as
if
he
knew
vaguely
what
was
coming
before
she
answered
his
curious
question
prompting
it
indeed
rose
in
his
mind
that
strange
idea
of
the
the
theory
that
big
souls
can
not
express
themselves
in
a
single
individual
but
need
an
entire
group
for
their
full
manifestation
he
listened
intently
the
reflection
that
this
sudden
intimacy
was
unnatural
he
rejected
for
many
conversations
were
really
gathered
into
one
long
watching
and
preparation
on
both
sides
had
cleared
the
way
for
the
ripening
of
acquaintance
into
confidence
how
long
he
dimly
wondered
but
if
this
conception
of
the
was
not
new
the
suggestion
lady
statham
developed
out
of
it
was
both
new
and
startling
and
yet
always
so
curiously
familiar
its
value
for
him
lay
not
in
evidence
that
supported
it
but
in
the
deep
belief
which
made
it
a
vital
asset
in
an
honest
inner
life
an
individual
she
said
quietly
one
soul
expressed
completely
in
a
single
person
i
mean
is
exceedingly
rare
not
often
is
a
physical
instrument
found
perfect
enough
to
provide
it
with
adequate
expression
in
the
lower
ranges
of
humanity
certainly
in
animal
and
insect
life
one
soul
is
shared
by
many
behind
a
tribe
of
savages

a
flock
of

is
a

bird
scattered
through
the
consciousness
of
all

deep
intelligence

all
as

henriot
knew
what
she
was
working
up
to
in
his
eagerness
to
hasten
disclosure
he
interrupted
and
there
may
be
types
of
life
that
have
no
corresponding
bodily
expression
at
all
then
he
asked
as
though
the
question
were
forced
out
of
him
they
exist
as
powers
unmanifested
on
the
earth
powers
she
answered
watching
him
closely
with
unswerving
stare
that
need
a
group
to
provide
their
body
their
physical
expression
if
they
came
back
came
back
he
repeated
below
his
breath
but
she
heard
him
they
once
had
expression
egypt
atlantis
knew
them

powers
that
never
visit
the

bodies
he
whispered
softly
actual
bodies
their
sphere
of
action
you
see
would
be
their
body
and
it
might
be
physical
outline
so
potent
a
descent
of
spiritual
life
would
select
materials
for
its
body
where
it
could
find
them
our
conventional
notion
of
a
body
what
is
it
a
single
outline
moving
altogether
in
one
direction
for
little
human
souls
or
fragments
this
is
sufficient
but
for
vaster
types
of
soul
an
entire
host
would
be
required
a
church
he
ventured
some
body
of
belief
you
surely
mean
she
bowed
her
head
a
moment
in
assent
she
was
determined
he
should
seize
her
meaning
fully
a
wave
of
spiritual
awakening
a
descent
of
spiritual
life
upon
a
nation
she
answered
slowly
forms
itself
a
church
and
the
body
of
true
believers
are
its
sphere
of
action
they
are
literally
its
bodily
expression
each
individual
believer
is
a
corpuscle
in
that
body
the
power
has
provided
itself
with
a
vehicle
of
manifestation
otherwise
we
could
not
know
it
and
the
more
real
the
belief
of
each
individual
the
more
perfect
the
expression
of
the
spiritual
life
behind
them
all
a
walks
the
earth
moreover
a
nation
naturally
devout
could
attract
a
type
of
soul
unknown
to
a
nation
that
denies
all
faith
faith
brings
back
the
gods
but
belief
is
dead
and
deity
has
left
the
world
she
talked
on
and
on
developing
this
main
idea
that
in
days
of
older
faiths
there
were
deific
types
of
life
upon
the
earth
evoked
by
worship
and
beneficial
to
humanity
they
had
long
ago
withdrawn
because
the
worship
which
brought
them
down
had
died
the
death
the
world
had
grown
pettier
these
vast
centres
of
spiritual
power
found
no
body
in
which
they
now
could
express
themselves
or
manifest
her
thoughts
and
phrases
poured
over
him
like
sand
it
was
always
sand
he
felt
burying
the
present
and
uncovering
the
past
he
tried
to
steady
his
mind
upon
familiar
objects
but
wherever
he
looked
sand
stared
him
in
the
face
outside
these
trivial
walls
the
desert
lay
listening
it
lay
waiting
too
vance
himself
had
dropped
out
of
recognition
he
belonged
to
the
world
of
things
but
this
woman
and
himself
stood
thousands
of
years
away
beneath
the
columns
of
a
temple
in
the
sands
and
the
sands
were
moving
his
feet
went
shifting
with
them
running
down
vistas
of
ageless
memory
that
woke
terror
by
their
sheer
immensity
of
distance
like
a
muffled
voice
that
called
to
him
through
many
veils
and
wrappings
he
heard
her
describe
the
stupendous
powers
that
evocation
might
coax
down
again
among
the
world
of
men
to
what
useful
end
he
asked
at
length
amazed
at
his
own
temerity
and
because
he
knew
instinctively
the
answer
in
advance
it
rose
through
these
layers
of
coiling
memory
in
his
soul
the
extension
of
spiritual
knowledge
and
the
widening
of
life
she
answered
the
link
with
the
kingdom
wherein
this
ancient
system
went
forever
searching
would
be
complete
rehabilitation
might
follow
portions
little
portions
of
these
powers
expressed
themselves
naturally
once
in
certain
animal
types
instinctive
life
that
did
not
deny
or
reject
them
the
worship
of
sacred
animals
was
the
relic
of
a
once
gigantic
system
of
evocation
not
of
monsters
and
she
smiled
sadly
but
of
powers
that
were
willing
and
ready
to
descend
when
worship
summoned
them
again
beneath
his
breath
henriot
heard
himself
murmur
his
own
voice
startled
him
as
he
whispered
it
actual
bodily
shape
and
outline
material
for
bodies
is
everywhere
she
answered
equally
low
dust
to
which
we
all
return
sand
if
you
prefer
it
fine
fine
sand
life
moulds
it
easily
enough
when
that
life
is
potent
a
certain
confusion
spread
slowly
through
his
mind
as
he
heard
her
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
some
minutes
in
silence
lady
statham
and
her
nephew
waited
for
him
to
speak
at
length
after
some
inner
battling
and
hesitation
he
put
the
question
that
he
knew
they
waited
for
it
was
impossible
to
resist
any
longer
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
the
method
he
said
and
to
revive
perhaps
by
experiment
before
he
could
complete
his
thought
she
took
him
up
there
are
some
who
claim
to
know
it
she
said
gravely
her
eyes
a
moment
masterful
a
clue
thus
followed
might
lead
to
the
entire
reconstruction
i
spoke
of
and
the
method
he
repeated
faintly
evoke
the
power
by
ceremonial
evocation
the
ritual
is
obtainable
and
note
the
form
it
assumes
then
establish
it
this
shape
or
outline
once
secured
could
then
be
made
permanent
a
mould
for
its
return
at
will
its

and
to

or

he
began
to
fix
it
rather
would
be
required
the
clever
pencil
of
a
fearless
some
one

proposition
henriot
exclaimed
what
surprised
him
was
that
he
felt
no
desire
to
laugh
and
little
even
to
doubt
yet
known
to
every
religion
that
ever
deserved
the
name
put
in
vance
like
a
voice
from
a
distance
blackness
came
somehow
with
his
interruption
a
touch
of
darkness
he
spoke
eagerly
to
all
the
talk
that
followed
and
there
was
much
of
it
henriot
listened
with
but
half
an
ear
this
one
idea
stormed
through
him
with
an
uproar
that
killed
attention
judgment
was
held
utterly
in
abeyance
he
carried
away
from
it
some
vague
suggestion
that
this
woman
had
hinted
at
previous
lives
she
half
remembered
and
that
every
year
she
came
to
egypt
haunting
the
sands
and
temples
in
the
effort
to
recover
lost
clues
and
he
recalled
afterwards
that
she
said
this
all
came
to
me
as
a
child
just
as
though
it
was
something
half
remembered
there
was
the
further
suggestion
that
he
himself
was
not
unknown
to
her
that
they
too
had
met
before
but
this
compared
to
the
grave
certainty
of
the
rest
was
merest
fantasy
that
did
not
hold
his
attention
he
answered
hardly
knowing
what
he
said
his
preoccupation
with
other
thoughts
deep
down
was
so
intense
that
he
was
probably
barely
polite
uttering
empty
phrases
with
his
mind
elsewhere
his
one
desire
was
to
escape
and
be
alone
and
it
was
with
genuine
relief
that
he
presently
excused
himself
and
went
upstairs
to
bed
the
halls
he
noticed
were
empty
an
arab
servant
waited
to
put
the
lights
out
he
walked
up
for
the
lift
had
long
ceased
running
and
the
magic
of
old
egypt
stalked
beside
him
the
studies
that
had
fascinated
his
mind
in
earlier
youth
returned
with
the
power
that
had
subdued
his
mind
in
boyhood
the
cult
of
osiris
woke
in
his
blood
again
horus
and
nephthys
stirred
in
their
centres
there
revived
in
him
too
long
buried
the
awful
glamour
of
those
liturgal
rites
and
vast
body
of
observances
those
spells
and
formulae
of
incantation
of
the
oldest
known
recension
that
years
ago
had
captured
his
imagination
and
belief
the
book
of
the
dead
trumpet
voices
called
to
his
heart
again
across
the
desert
of
some
dim
past
there
were
forms
of
life
impulses
from
the
creative
power
which
is
the
universe
other
than
the
soul
of
man
they
could
be
known
a
spiritual
exaltation
roused
by
the
words
and
presence
of
this
singular
woman
shouted
to
him
as
he
went
then
as
he
closed
his
bedroom
door
carefully
locking
it
there
stood
beside
him
vance
the
forgotten
figure
of
vance
came
up
close
the
watching
eyes
the
simulated
interest
the
feigned
belief
the
detective
mental
attitude
these
broke
through
the
grandiose
panorama
bringing
darkness
vance
strong
personality
that
hid
behind
assumed
nonentity
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
intruded
with
sudden
violence
demanding
an
explanation
of
his
presence
and
with
an
equal
suddenness
explanation
offered
itself
then
and
there
it
came
unsought
its
horror
of
certainty
utterly
unjustified
and
it
came
in
this
unexpected
fashion
behind
the
interest
and
acquiescence
of
the
man
ran
fear
but
behind
the
vivid
fear
ran
another
thing
that
henriot
now
perceived
was
vile
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
henriot
knew
it
at
close
quarters
actual
ready
to
operate
though
familiar
enough
in
daily
life
to
be
of
common
occurrence
henriot
had
never
realised
it
as
he
did
now
so
close
and
terrible
in
the
same
way
he
had
never
that
he
would
die
vanish
from
the
busy
world
of
men
and
women
forgotten
as
though
he
had
never
existed
an
eddy
of
dust
and
in
the
man
named
richard
vance
this
thing
was
close
upon
blossom
henriot
could
not
name
it
to
himself
even
in
thought
it
appalled
him
he
undressed
hurriedly
almost
with
the
child
idea
of
finding
safety
between
the
sheets
his
mind
undressed
itself
as
well
the
business
of
the
day
laid
itself
automatically
aside
the
will
sank
down
desire
grew
inactive
henriot
was
exhausted
but
in
that
stage
towards
slumber
when
thinking
stops
and
only
fugitive
pictures
pass
across
the
mind
in
shadowy
dance
his
brain
ceased
shouting
its
mechanical
explanations
and
his
soul
unveiled
a
peering
eye
great
limbs
of
memory
smothered
by
the
activities
of
the
present
stirred
their
stiffened
lengths
through
the
sands
of
long
ago
sands
this
woman
had
begun
to
excavate
from
some
they
had
surely
known
together
vagueness
and
certainty
ran
hand
in
hand
details
were
unrecoverable
but
the
emotions
in
which
they
were
embedded
moved
he
turned
restlessly
in
his
bed
striving
to
seize
the
amazing
clues
and
follow
them
but
deliberate
effort
hid
them
instantly
again
they
retired
instantly
into
the
subconsciousness
with
the
brain
of
this
body
he
now
occupied
they
had
nothing
to
do
the
brain
stored
memories
of
each
life
only
this
ancient
script
was
graven
in
his
soul
subconsciousness
alone
could
interpret
and
reveal
and
it
was
his
subconscious
memory
that
lady
statham
had
been
so
busily
excavating
dimly
it
stirred
and
moved
about
the
depths
within
him
never
clearly
seen
indefinite
felt
as
a
yearning
after
unrecoverable
knowledge
against
the
darker
background
of
vance
fear
and
sinister
purpose
both
of
this
present
life
and
recent
he
saw
the
grandeur
of
this
impossible
dream
and
beyond
argument
or
reason
that
it
was
true
judgment
and
will
asleep
he
left
the
impossibility
aside
and
took
the
grandeur
the
belief
of
lady
statham
was
not
credulity
and
superstition
it
was
memory
still
to
this
day
over
the
sands
of
egypt
hovered
immense
spiritual
potencies
so
vast
that
they
could
only
know
physical
expression
in
a
group
in
many
their
sphere
of
bodily
manifestation
must
be
a
host
each
individual
unit
in
that
host
a
corpuscle
in
the
whole
the
wind
rising
from
the
lybian
wastes
across
the
nile
swept
up
against
the
exposed
side
of
the
hotel
and
made
his
windows
rattle
the
old
sad
winds
of
egypt
henriot
got
out
of
bed
to
fasten
the
outside
shutters
he
stood
a
moment
and
watched
the
moon
floating
down
behind
the
sakkara
pyramids
the
pleiades
and
orion
belt
hung
brilliantly
the
great
bear
was
close
to
the
horizon
in
the
sky
above
the
desert
swung
ten
thousand
stars
no
sounds
rose
from
the
streets
of
helouan
the
tide
of
sand
was
coming
slowly
in
and
a
flock
of
enormous
thoughts
swooped
past
him
from
fields
of
this
unbelievable
lost
memory
the
desert
pale
in
the
moon
was
coextensive
with
the
night
too
huge
for
comfort
or
understanding
yet
charged
to
the
brim
with
infinite
peace
behind
its
majesty
of
silence
lay
whispers
of
a
vanished
language
that
once
could
call
with
power
upon
mighty
spiritual
agencies
its
skirts
were
folded
now
but
slowly
across
the
leagues
of
sand
they
began
to
stir
and
rearrange
themselves
he
grew
suddenly
aware
of
this
enveloping
shroud
of
sand
as
the
raw
material
of
bodily
expression
form
the
sand
was
in
his
imagination
and
his
mind
shaking
loosely
the
folds
of
its
gigantic
skirts
it
rose
it
moved
a
little
towards
him
he
saw
the
eternal
countenance
of
the
desert
watching
him
immobile
and
unchanging
behind
these
shifting
veils
the
winds
laid
so
carefully
over
it
egypt
the
ancient
egypt
turned
in
her
vast
sarcophagus
of
desert
wakening
from
her
sleep
of
ages
at
the
belief
of
approaching
worshippers
only
in
this
insignificant
manner
could
he
express
a
letter
of
the
terrific
language
that
crowded
to
seek
expression
through
his
soul
he
closed
the
shutters
and
carefully
fastened
them
he
turned
to
go
back
to
bed
curiously
trembling
then
as
he
did
so
the
whole
singular
delusion
caught
him
with
a
shock
that
held
him
motionless
up
rose
the
stupendous
apparition
of
the
entire
desert
and
stood
behind
him
on
that
balcony
swift
as
thought
in
silence
the
desert
stood
on
end
against
his
very
face
it
towered
across
the
sky
hiding
orion
and
the
moon
it
dipped
below
the
horizons
the
whole
grey
sheet
of
it
rose
up
before
his
eyes
and
stood
through
its
unfolding
skirts
ran
ten
thousand
eddies
of
swirling
sand
as
the
creases
of
its
smoothed
themselves
out
in
moonlight
and
a
bleak
scarred
countenance
huge
as
a
planet
gazed
down
into
his
own
through
his
dreamless
sleep
that
night
two
things
lay
active
and
awake
in
the
subconscious
part
that
knows
no
slumber
they
were
incongruous
one
was
evil
small
and
human
the
other
unearthly
and
sublime
for
the
memory
of
the
fear
that
haunted
vance
and
the
sinister
cause
of
it
pricked
at
him
all
night
long
but
behind
beyond
this
common
intelligible
emotion
lay
the
crowding
wonder
that
caught
his
soul
with
glory
the
sand
was
stirring
the
desert
was
awake
ready
to
mate
with
them
in
material
form
brooded
close
the
ka
of
that
colossal
entity
that
once
expressed
itself
through
the
myriad
life
of
ancient
egypt
vi
next
day
and
for
several
days
following
henriot
kept
out
of
the
path
of
lady
statham
and
her
nephew
the
acquaintanceship
had
grown
too
rapidly
to
be
quite
comfortable
it
was
easy
to
pretend
that
he
took
people
at
their
face
value
but
it
was
a
pose
one
liked
to
know
something
of
antecedents
it
was
otherwise
difficult
to
place
them
and
henriot
for
the
life
of
him
could
not
place
these
two
his
subconsciousness
brought
explanation
when
it
came
but
the
subconsciousness
is
only
temporarily
active
when
it
retired
he
floundered
without
a
rudder
in
confusion
with
the
flood
of
morning
sunshine
the
value
of
much
she
had
said
evaporated
her
presence
alone
had
supplied
the
key
to
the
cipher
but
while
the
indigestible
portions
he
rejected
there
remained
a
good
deal
he
had
already
assimilated
the
discomfort
remained
and
with
it
the
grave
unholy
reality
of
it
all
it
was
something
more
than
theory
results
would
follow
if
he
joined
them
he
would
witness
curious
things
the
force
with
which
it
drew
him
brought
hesitation
it
operated
in
him
like
a
shock
that
numbs
at
first
by
its
abrupt
arrival
and
needs
time
to
realise
in
the
right
proportions
to
the
rest
of
life
these
right
proportions
however
did
not
come
readily
and
his
emotions
ranged
between
sceptical
laughter
and
complete
acceptance
the
one
detail
he
felt
certain
of
was
this
dreadful
thing
he
had
divined
in
vance
trying
hard
to
disbelieve
it
he
found
he
could
not
it
was
true
though
without
a
shred
of
real
evidence
to
support
it
the
horror
of
it
remained
he
knew
it
in
his
very
bones
and
this
perhaps
was
what
drove
him
to
seek
the
comforting
companionship
of
folk
he
understood
and
felt
at
home
with
he
told
his
host
and
hostess
about
the
strangers
though
omitting
the
actual
conversation
because
they
would
merely
smile
in
blank
miscomprehension
but
the
moment
he
described
the
strong
black
eyes
beneath
the
level
eyelids
his
hostess
turned
with
a
start
her
interest
deeply
roused
why
it
that
awful
statham
woman
she
exclaimed
that
must
be
lady
statham
and
the
man
she
calls
her
nephew
sounds
like
it
certainly
her
husband
added
felix
you
better
clear
out
they
bewitch
you
too
and
henriot
bridled
yet
wondering
why
he
did
so
he
drew
into
his
shell
a
little
giving
the
merest
sketch
of
what
had
happened
but
he
listened
closely
while
these
two
practical
old
friends
supplied
him
with
information
in
the
gossiping
way
that
human
nature
loves
no
doubt
there
was
much
embroidery
and
more
perversion
exaggeration
too
but
the
account
evidently
rested
upon
some
basis
of
solid
foundation
for
all
that
smoke
and
fire
go
together
always
he
her
nephew
right
enough
mansfield
corrected
his
wife
before
proceeding
to
his
own
man
form
of
elaboration
no
question
about
that
i
believe
he
her
favourite
nephew
and
she
as
rich
as
a
pig
he
follows
her
out
here
every
year
waiting
for
her
empty
shoes
but
they
an
unsavoury
couple
i
met
in
various
parts
all
over
egypt
but
they
always
come
back
to
helouan
in
the
end
and
the
stories
about
them
are
simply
legion
you
remember
he
turned
hesitatingly
to
his
wife
some
people
i
heard
he
changed
his
sentence
were
made
quite
ill
by
her
i
sure
felix
ought
to
know
yes
his
wife
boldly
took
him
up
my
niece
fanny
had
the
most
extraordinary
experience
she
turned
to
henriot
her
room
was
next
to
lady
statham
in
some
hotel
or
other
at
assouan
or
edfu
and
one
night
she
woke
and
heard
a
kind
of
mysterious
chanting
or
intoning
next
her
hotel
doors
are
so
dreadfully
thin
there
was
a
funny
smell
too
like
incense
of
something
sickly
and
a
voice
kept
chiming
in
it
went
on
for
hours
while
she
lay
terrified
in
bed
frightened
you
say
asked
henriot
out
of
her
skin
yes
she
said
it
was
so
uncanny
made
her
feel
icy
she
wanted
to
ring
the
bell
but
was
afraid
to
leave
her
bed
the
room
was
full
of
of
things
yet
she
could
see
nothing
she
them
you
see
and
after
a
bit
the
sound
of
this
voice
so
got
on
her
nerves
it
half
dazed
her
a
kind
of
enchantment
she
felt
choked
and
suffocated
and
then
it
was
her
turn
to
hesitate
tell
it
all
her
husband
said
quite
gravely
too
well
something
came
in
at
least
she
describes
it
oddly
rather
she
said
it
made
the
door
bulge
inwards
from
the
next
room
but
not
the
door
alone
the
walls
bulged
or
swayed
as
if
a
huge
thing
pressed
against
them
from
the
other
side
and
at
the
same
moment
her
windows
she
had
two
big
balconies
and
the
venetian
shutters
were
fastened
both
her
windows
though
it
was
two
in
the
morning
and
pitch
dark
outside
she
said
it
was
all
thing
trying
to
get
in
just
as
water
you
see
would
rush
in
through
every
hole
and
opening
it
could
find
and
all
at
once
and
in
spite
of
her
terror
that
the
odd
part
of
it
she
says
she
felt
a
kind
of
splendour
in
her
a
sort
of
elation
she
saw
nothing
she
says
she
does
remember
her
senses
left
her
i
believe
though
she
wo
admit
it
fainted
for
a
minute
probably
said
mansfield
so
there
it
is
his
wife
concluded
after
a
silence
and
that
true
it
happened
to
my
niece
did
it
john
stories
and
legendary
accounts
of
strange
things
that
the
presence
of
these
two
brought
poured
out
then
they
were
obviously
somewhat
mixed
one
account
borrowing
picturesque
details
from
another
and
all
in
disproportion
as
when
people
tell
stories
in
a
language
they
are
little
familiar
with
but
listening
with
avidity
yet
also
with
uneasiness
somehow
henriot
put
two
and
two
together
truth
stood
behind
them
somewhere
these
two
held
traffic
with
the
powers
that
ancient
egypt
knew
tell
felix
dear
about
the
time
you
met
the
nephew
horrid
creature
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
he
heard
his
wife
say
presently
and
mansfield
told
it
plainly
enough
evidently
glad
to
get
it
done
though
it
was
some
years
ago
now
and
i
did
know
who
he
was
then
or
anything
about
him
i
do
know
much
more
now
except
that
he
a
dangerous
sort
of
think
but
i
came
across
him
one
night
up
there
by
thebes
in
the
valley
of
the
kings
you
know
where
they
buried
all
their
johnnies
with
so
much
magnificence
and
processions
and
masses
and
all
the
rest
it
the
most
astounding
the
most
haunted
place
you
ever
saw
gloomy
silent
full
of
gorgeous
lights
and
shadows
that
seem
alive
terribly
impressive
it
makes
you
creep
and
shudder
you
feel
old
egypt
watching
you
get
on
dear
said
his
wife
well
i
was
coming
home
late
on
a
blasted
lazy
donkey
into
the
bargain
when
my
donkey
boy
suddenly
ran
for
his
life
and
left
me
alone
it
was
after
sunset
the
sand
was
red
and
shining
and
the
big
cliffs
sort
of
fiery
and
my
donkey
stuck
its
four
feet
in
the
ground
and
would
budge
then
about
fifty
yards
away
i
saw
a
fellow
european
apparently
doing
something
heaven
knows
what
for
i
ca
describe
it
among
the
boulders
that
lie
all
over
the
ground
there
ceremony
i
suppose
you
call
it
i
was
so
interested
that
at
first
i
watched
then
i
saw
he
was
alone
there
were
a
lot
of
moving
things
round
him
towering
big
things
that
came
and
went
like
shadows
that
twilight
is
fearfully
bewildering
perspective
changes
and
distance
gets
all
confused
it
fearfully
hard
to
see
properly
i
only
remember
that
i
got
off
my
donkey
and
went
up
closer
and
when
i
was
within
a
dozen
yards
of
him
well
it
sounds
such
rot
you
know
but
i
swear
the
things
suddenly
rushed
off
and
left
him
there
alone
they
went
with
a
roaring
noise
like
wind
shadowy
but
tremendously
big
they
were
and
they
vanished
up
against
the
fiery
precipices
as
though
they
slipped
bang
into
the
stone
itself
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
to
describe
is
well
those
the
khamasin
raises
the
hot
winds
you
know
they
probably
sand
his
wife
suggested
burning
to
tell
another
story
of
her
own
possibly
only
there
was
a
breath
of
wind
and
it
was
hot
as
blazes
and
i
had
such
extraordinary
sensations
never
felt
anything
like
it
before
wild
and
exhilarated
drunk
i
tell
you
drunk
you
saw
them
asked
henriot
you
made
out
their
shape
at
all
or
outline
sphinx
he
replied
at
once
for
all
the
world
like
sphinxes
you
know
the
kind
of
face
and
head
these
limestone
strata
in
the
desert
take
great
visages
with
square
egyptian
where
the
driven
sand
has
eaten
away
the
softer
stuff
beneath
you
see
it
everywhere
enormous
idols
they
seem
with
faces
and
eyes
and
lips
awfully
like
the
sphinx
well
that
the
nearest
i
can
get
to
it
he
puffed
his
pipe
hard
but
there
was
no
sign
of
levity
in
him
he
told
the
actual
truth
as
far
as
in
him
lay
yet
half
ashamed
of
what
he
told
and
a
good
deal
he
left
out
too
she
got
a
face
of
the
same
sort
that
statham
horror
his
wife
said
with
a
shiver
reduce
the
size
and
paint
in
awful
black
eyes
and
you
got
her
exactly
a
living
idol
and
all
three
laughed
yet
a
laughter
without
merriment
in
it
and
you
spoke
to
the
man
i
did
the
englishman
answered
though
i
confess
i
a
bit
ashamed
of
the
way
i
spoke
fact
is
i
was
excited
thunderingly
excited
and
felt
a
kind
of
anger
i
wanted
to
kick
the
beggar
for
practising
such
bally
rubbish
and
in
such
a
place
too
yet
all
the
time
well
well
i
believe
it
was
sheer
funk
now
he
laughed
for
i
felt
uncommonly
queer
out
there
in
the
dusk
alone
with
with
that
kind
of
business
and
i
was
angry
with
myself
for
feeling
it
anyhow
i
went
up
i
lost
my
donkey
boy
as
well
remember
and
slated
him
like
a
dog
i
ca
remember
what
i
said
exactly
only
that
he
stood
and
stared
at
me
in
silence
that
made
it
worse
seemed
twice
as
real
then
the
beggar
said
no
single
word
the
whole
time
he
signed
to
me
with
one
hand
to
clear
out
and
then
suddenly
out
of
nothing
she
that
woman
appeared
and
stood
beside
him
i
never
saw
her
come
she
must
have
been
behind
some
boulder
or
other
for
she
simply
rose
out
of
the
ground
she
stood
there
and
stared
at
me
too
bang
in
the
face
she
was
turned
towards
the
sunset
what
was
left
of
it
in
the
west
and
her
black
eyes
shone
like
ugh
i
ca
describe
it
it
was
shocking
she
spoke
she
said
five
words
and
her
voice
it
make
you
laugh
it
was
metallic
like
a
gong
are
in
danger
here
that
all
she
said
i
simply
turned
and
cleared
out
as
fast
as
ever
i
could
but
i
had
to
go
on
foot
my
donkey
had
followed
its
boy
long
before
i
tell
you
smile
as
you
may
my
blood
was
all
curdled
for
an
hour
afterwards
then
he
explained
that
he
felt
some
kind
of
explanation
or
apology
was
due
since
the
couple
lodged
in
his
own
hotel
and
how
he
approached
the
man
in
the
after
dinner
a
conversation
resulted
the
man
was
quite
intelligent
after
all
of
which
only
one
sentence
had
remained
in
his
mind
perhaps
you
can
explain
it
felix
i
wrote
it
down
as
well
as
i
could
remember
the
rest
confused
me
beyond
words
or
memory
though
i
must
confess
it
did
not
seem
well
not
utter
rot
exactly
it
was
about
astrology
and
rituals
and
the
worship
of
the
old
egyptians
and
i
know
what
else
besides
only
he
made
it
intelligible
and
almost
sensible
if
only
i
could
have
got
the
hang
of
the
thing
enough
to
remember
it
you
know
he
added
as
though
believing
in
spite
of
himself
there
a
lot
of
that
wonderful
old
egyptian
religious
business
still
hanging
about
in
the
atmosphere
of
this
place
say
what
you
like
but
this
sentence
henriot
asked
and
the
other
went
off
to
get
a
where
he
had
written
it
down
he
was
jawing
you
see
he
continued
when
he
came
back
henriot
and
his
wife
having
kept
silence
meanwhile
about
direction
being
of
importance
in
religious
ceremonies
west
and
north
symbolising
certain
powers
or
something
of
the
kind
why
people
turn
to
the
east
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
and
speaking
of
the
whole
universe
as
if
it
had
living
forces
tucked
away
in
it
that
expressed
themselves
somehow
when
roused
up
that
how
i
remember
it
anyhow
and
then
he
said
this
thing
in
answer
to
some
fool
question
probably
that
i
put
and
he
read
out
of
the
were
in
danger
because
you
came
through
the
gateway
of
the
west
and
the
powers
from
the
gateway
of
the
east
were
at
that
moment
rising
and
therefore
in
direct
opposition
to
you
then
came
the
following
apparently
a
simile
offered
by
way
of
explanation
mansfield
read
it
in
a
shamefaced
tone
evidently
prepared
for
laughter
i
strike
you
on
the
back
or
in
the
face
determines
what
kind
of
answering
force
i
rouse
in
you
direction
is
significant
and
he
said
it
was
the
period
called
the
night
of
power
time
when
the
desert
encroaches
and
spirits
are
close
and
tossing
the
book
aside
he
lit
his
pipe
again
and
waited
a
moment
to
hear
what
might
be
said
can
you
explain
such
gibberish
he
asked
at
length
as
neither
of
his
listeners
spoke
but
henriot
said
he
could
and
the
wife
then
took
up
her
own
tale
of
stories
that
had
grown
about
this
singular
couple
these
were
less
detailed
and
therefore
less
impressive
but
all
contributed
something
towards
the
atmosphere
of
reality
that
framed
the
entire
picture
they
belonged
to
the
type
one
hears
at
every
dinner
party
in
egypt
stories
of
the
vengeance
mummies
seem
to
take
on
those
who
robbed
them
desecrating
their
peace
of
centuries
of
a
woman
wearing
a
necklace
of
scarabs
taken
from
a
princess
tomb
who
felt
hands
about
her
throat
to
strangle
her
of
little
ka
figures
pasht
goddesses
amulets
and
the
rest
that
brought
curious
disaster
to
those
who
kept
them
they
are
many
and
various
astonishingly
circumstantial
often
and
vouched
for
by
persons
the
reverse
of
credulous
the
modern
superstition
that
haunts
the
desert
gullies
with
afreets
has
nothing
in
common
with
them
they
rest
upon
a
basis
of
indubitable
experience
and
they
remain
inexplicable
and
about
the
personalities
of
lady
statham
and
her
nephew
they
crowded
like
flies
attracted
by
a
dish
of
fruit
the
arabs
too
were
afraid
of
her
she
had
difficulty
in
getting
guides
and
dragomen
my
dear
chap
concluded
mansfield
take
my
advice
and
have
nothing
to
do
with
there
a
lot
of
queer
business
knocking
about
in
this
old
country
and
people
like
that
know
ways
of
reviving
it
somehow
upset
you
already
you
looked
scared
i
thought
the
moment
you
came
in
they
laughed
but
the
englishman
was
in
earnest
i
tell
you
what
he
added
we
go
off
for
a
bit
of
shooting
together
the
fields
along
the
delta
are
packed
with
birds
now
they
home
early
this
year
on
their
way
to
the
north
what
d
say
eh
but
henriot
did
not
care
about
the
quail
shooting
he
felt
more
inclined
to
be
alone
and
think
things
out
by
himself
he
had
come
to
his
friends
for
comfort
and
instead
they
had
made
him
uneasy
and
excited
his
interest
had
suddenly
doubled
though
half
afraid
he
longed
to
know
what
these
two
were
up
to
to
follow
the
adventure
to
the
bitter
end
he
disregarded
the
warning
of
his
host
as
well
as
the
premonition
in
his
own
heart
the
sand
had
caught
his
feet
there
were
moments
when
he
laughed
in
utter
disbelief
but
these
were
optimistic
moods
that
did
not
last
he
always
returned
to
the
feeling
that
truth
lurked
somewhere
in
the
whole
strange
business
and
that
if
he
joined
forces
with
them
as
they
seemed
to
wish
he
would
witness
well
he
hardly
knew
what
but
it
enticed
him
as
danger
does
the
reckless
man
or
death
the
suicide
the
sand
had
caught
his
mind
he
decided
to
offer
himself
to
all
they
wanted
his
pencil
too
he
would
see
a
shiver
ran
through
him
at
the
thought
what
they
saw
and
know
some
eddy
of
that
vanished
tide
of
power
and
splendour
the
ancient
egyptian
priesthood
knew
and
that
perhaps
was
even
common
experience
in
the
days
of
dim
atlantis
the
sand
had
caught
his
imagination
too
he
was
utterly
vii
and
so
he
took
pains
though
without
making
definite
suggestion
to
place
himself
in
the
way
of
this
woman
and
her
nephew
only
to
find
that
his
hints
were
disregarded
they
left
him
alone
if
they
did
not
actually
avoid
him
moreover
he
rarely
came
across
them
now
only
at
night
or
in
the
queer
dusk
hours
he
caught
glimpses
of
them
moving
hurriedly
off
from
the
hotel
and
always
desertwards
and
their
disregard
well
calculated
enflamed
his
desire
to
the
point
when
he
almost
decided
to
propose
himself
quite
suddenly
then
the
idea
flashed
through
him
how
do
they
come
these
odd
revelations
when
the
mind
lies
receptive
like
a
plate
sensitised
by
anticipation
that
they
were
waiting
for
a
certain
date
and
with
the
notion
came
remark
about
the
night
of
power
believed
in
by
the
old
egyptian
calendar
as
a
time
when
the
supersensuous
world
moves
close
against
the
minds
of
men
with
all
its
troop
of
possibilities
and
the
thought
once
lodged
in
its
corner
of
imagination
grew
strong
he
looked
it
up
ten
days
from
now
he
found
would
be
upon
him
with
a
moon
too
at
the
full
and
this
strange
hint
of
guidance
he
accepted
in
his
present
mood
as
he
admitted
smiling
to
himself
he
could
accept
anything
it
was
part
of
it
it
belonged
to
the
adventure
but
even
while
he
persuaded
himself
that
it
was
play
the
solemn
reality
of
what
lay
ahead
increased
amazingly
sketched
darkly
in
his
very
soul
these
intervening
days
he
spent
as
best
he
could
impatiently
a
prey
to
quite
opposite
emotions
in
the
blazing
sunshine
he
thought
of
it
and
laughed
but
at
night
he
lay
often
sleepless
calculating
chances
of
escape
he
never
did
escape
however
the
desert
that
watched
little
helouan
with
great
unwinking
eyes
watched
also
every
turn
and
twist
he
made
like
this
oasis
he
basked
in
the
sun
of
older
time
and
dreamed
beneath
forgotten
moons
the
sand
at
last
had
crept
into
his
inmost
heart
it
sifted
over
him
seeking
a
reaction
from
normal
everyday
things
he
made
tourist
trips
yet
while
recognising
the
comedy
in
his
attitude
he
never
could
lose
sight
of
the
grandeur
that
banked
it
up
so
hauntingly
these
two
contrary
emotions
grafted
themselves
on
all
he
did
and
saw
he
crossed
the
nile
at
bedrashein
and
went
again
to
the
of
sakkara
but
through
all
the
chatter
of
veiled
and
helmeted
tourists
the
of
our
modern
jungle
ran
this
dark
of
awe
their
monkey
methods
could
not
turn
aside
one
world
lay
upon
another
but
this
modern
layer
was
a
shallow
crust
that
like
the
phenomenon
of
the
a
mere
angle
of
falling
light
could
instantly
obliterate
beneath
the
sand
deep
down
he
passed
along
the
street
of
tombs
as
he
had
often
passed
before
moved
then
merely
by
historical
curiosity
and
admiration
but
now
by
emotions
for
which
he
found
no
name
he
saw
the
enormous
sarcophagi
of
granite
in
their
gloomy
chambers
where
the
sacred
bulls
once
lay
swathed
and
embalmed
like
human
beings
and
in
the
flickering
candle
light
the
mood
of
ancient
rites
surged
round
him
menacing
his
doubts
and
laughter
the
least
human
whisper
in
these
subterraneans
dug
out
first
four
thousand
years
ago
revived
ominous
powers
that
stalked
beside
him
forbidding
and
premonitive
he
gazed
at
the
spots
where
mariette
unearthing
them
forty
years
ago
found
fresh
as
of
yesterday
the
marks
of
fingers
and
naked
feet
of
those
who
set
the
ton
slabs
in
position
and
when
he
came
up
again
into
the
sunshine
he
met
the
eternal
questions
of
the
pyramids
overtopping
all
his
mental
horizons
sand
blocked
all
the
avenues
of
younger
emotion
leaving
the
channels
of
something
in
him
incalculably
older
open
and
clean
swept
he
slipped
homewards
uncomfortable
and
followed
glad
to
be
with
a
crowd
because
he
was
otherwise
alone
with
more
than
he
could
dare
to
think
about
keeping
just
ahead
of
his
companions
he
crossed
the
desert
edge
where
the
ghost
of
memphis
walks
under
rustling
palm
trees
that
screen
no
stone
left
upon
another
of
all
its
populous
splendours
for
here
was
a
vista
his
imagination
could
realise
here
he
could
know
the
comfort
of
solid
ground
his
feet
could
touch
gigantic
ramases
lying
on
his
back
beneath
their
shade
and
staring
at
the
sky
similarly
helped
to
steady
his
swaying
thoughts
imagination
could
deal
with
these
and
daily
thus
he
watched
the
busy
world
go
to
and
fro
to
its
scale
of
tips
and
bargaining
and
gladly
mingled
with
it
trying
to
laugh
and
study
guidebooks
and
listen
to
explanations
but
always
seeing
the
comedy
of
his
poor
attempts
not
all
those
little
donkeys
bells
tinkling
beads
shining
trotting
beneath
their
comical
burdens
to
the
tune
of
shouting
and
belabouring
could
stem
this
tide
of
deeper
things
the
woman
had
let
loose
in
the
subconscious
part
of
him
everywhere
he
saw
the
mysterious
camels
go
slouching
through
the
sand
gurgling
the
water
in
their
skinny
extended
throats
centuries
passed
between
the
enormous
of
their
stride
and
every
night
the
sunsets
restored
the
forbidding
graver
mood
with
their
crimson
golden
splendour
their
strange
green
shafts
of
light
then
sudden
twilight
that
brought
the
past
upon
him
with
an
awful
leap
upon
the
stage
then
stepped
the
figures
of
this
pair
of
human
beings
chanting
their
ancient
plainsong
of
incantation
in
the
moonlit
desert
and
working
their
rites
of
unholy
evocation
as
the
priests
had
worked
them
centuries
before
in
the
sands
that
now
buried
sakkara
fathoms
deep
then
one
morning
he
woke
with
a
question
in
his
mind
as
though
it
had
been
asked
of
him
in
sleep
and
he
had
waked
just
before
the
answer
came
why
do
i
spend
my
time
instead
of
going
alone
into
the
desert
as
before
what
has
made
me
change
this
latest
mood
now
asked
for
explanation
and
the
answer
coming
up
automatically
startled
him
it
was
so
clear
and
sure
had
been
lying
in
the
background
all
along
one
word
contained
it
vance
the
sinister
intentions
of
this
man
forgotten
in
the
rush
of
other
emotions
asserted
themselves
again
convincingly
the
human
horror
so
easily
comprehensible
had
been
smothered
for
the
time
by
the
hint
of
unearthly
revelations
but
it
had
operated
all
the
time
now
it
took
the
lead
he
dreaded
to
be
alone
in
the
desert
with
this
dark
picture
in
his
mind
of
what
vance
meant
to
bring
there
to
completion
this
abomination
of
a
selfish
human
will
returned
to
fix
its
terror
in
him
to
be
alone
in
the
desert
meant
to
be
alone
with
the
imaginative
picture
of
what
vance
he
knew
it
with
such
strange
certainty
hoped
to
bring
about
there
there
was
absolutely
no
evidence
to
justify
the
grim
suspicion
it
seemed
indeed
enough
this
connection
between
the
sand
and
the
purpose
of
an
violent
man
but
henriot
saw
it
true
he
could
argue
it
away
in
a
few
minutes
easily
yet
the
instant
thought
ceased
it
returned
led
up
by
intuition
it
possessed
him
filled
his
mind
with
horrible
possibilities
he
feared
the
desert
as
he
might
have
feared
the
scene
of
some
atrocious
crime
and
for
the
time
this
dread
of
a
merely
human
thing
corrected
the
big
seduction
of
the
other
the
suggested
side
by
side
with
it
his
desire
to
join
himself
to
the
purposes
of
the
woman
increased
steadily
they
kept
out
of
his
way
apparently
the
offer
seemed
withdrawn
he
grew
restless
unable
to
settle
to
anything
for
long
and
once
he
asked
the
porter
casually
if
they
were
leaving
the
hotel
lady
statham
had
been
invisible
for
days
and
vance
was
somehow
never
within
speaking
distance
he
heard
with
relief
that
they
had
not
gone
but
with
dread
as
well
keen
excitement
worked
in
him
underground
he
slept
badly
like
a
schoolboy
he
waited
for
the
summons
to
an
important
examination
that
involved
portentous
issues
and
contradictory
emotions
disturbed
his
peace
of
mind
abominably
viii
but
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
week
when
vance
approached
him
with
purpose
in
his
eyes
and
manner
that
henriot
knew
his
fears
unfounded
and
caught
himself
trembling
with
sudden
anticipation
because
the
invitation
so
desired
yet
so
dreaded
was
actually
at
hand
firmly
determined
to
keep
caution
uppermost
yet
he
went
unresistingly
to
a
secluded
corner
by
the
palms
where
they
could
talk
in
privacy
for
prudence
is
of
the
mind
but
desire
is
of
the
soul
and
while
his
brain
of
whispered
wariness
voices
in
his
heart
of
long
ago
shouted
commands
that
he
knew
he
must
obey
with
joy
it
was
evening
and
the
stars
were
out
helouan
with
her
fairy
twinkling
lights
lay
silent
against
the
desert
edge
the
sand
was
at
the
flood
the
period
of
the
encroaching
of
the
desert
was
at
hand
and
the
deeps
were
all
astir
with
movement
but
in
the
windless
air
was
a
great
peace
a
calm
of
infinite
stillness
breathed
everywhere
the
flow
of
time
before
it
rushed
away
backwards
stopped
somewhere
between
the
dust
of
stars
and
desert
the
mystery
of
sand
touched
every
street
with
its
unutterable
softness
and
vance
began
without
the
smallest
circumlocution
his
voice
was
low
in
keeping
with
the
scene
but
the
words
dropped
with
a
sharp
distinctness
into
the
other
heart
like
grains
of
sand
that
pricked
the
skin
before
they
smothered
him
caution
they
smothered
instantly
resistance
too
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
my
aunt
he
said
as
though
he
brought
an
invitation
to
a
picnic
henriot
sat
in
shadow
but
his
face
was
in
a
patch
of
light
that
followed
them
from
the
windows
of
the
central
hall
there
was
a
shining
in
the
light
blue
eyes
that
betrayed
the
excitement
his
quiet
manner
concealed
we
are
going
the
day
after
to
spend
the
night
in
the
desert
she
wondered
if
perhaps
you
would
care
to
join
us
for
your
experiment
asked
henriot
bluntly
vance
smiled
with
his
lips
holding
his
eyes
steady
though
unable
to
suppress
the
gleam
that
flashed
in
them
and
was
gone
so
swiftly
there
was
a
hint
of
shrugging
his
shoulders
it
is
the
night
of
power
in
the
old
egyptian
calendar
you
know
he
answered
with
assumed
lightness
almost
the
final
moment
of
the
period
of
black
nights
when
the
desert
was
held
to
encroach
with
with
various
possibilities
of
a
supernatural
order
she
wishes
to
revive
a
certain
practice
of
the
old
egyptians
there
be
curious
results
at
any
rate
the
occasion
is
a
picturesque
one
better
than
this
cheap
imitation
of
london
life
and
he
indicated
the
lights
the
signs
of
people
in
the
hall
dressed
for
gaieties
and
dances
the
hotel
orchestra
that
played
after
dinner
henriot
at
the
moment
answered
nothing
so
great
was
the
rush
of
conflicting
emotions
that
came
he
knew
not
whence
vance
went
calmly
on
he
spoke
with
a
simple
frankness
that
was
meant
to
be
disarming
henriot
never
took
his
eyes
off
him
the
two
men
stared
steadily
at
one
another
she
wants
to
know
if
you
will
come
and
help
too
in
a
certain
way
only
not
in
the
experiment
itself
precisely
but
by
watching
merely
and
he
hesitated
an
instant
half
lowering
his
eyes
drawing
the
picture
henriot
helped
him
deliberately
drawing
what
you
see
yes
vance
replied
the
voice
turned
graver
in
spite
of
himself
she
wants
she
hopes
to
catch
the
outlines
of
anything
that
happens
comes
exactly
determine
the
shape
of
anything
that
comes
you
may
remember
your
conversation
of
the
other
night
with
her
she
is
very
certain
of
success
this
was
direct
enough
at
any
rate
it
was
as
formal
as
an
invitation
to
a
dinner
and
as
guileless
the
thing
he
thought
he
wanted
lay
within
his
reach
he
had
merely
to
say
yes
he
did
say
yes
but
first
he
looked
about
him
instinctively
as
for
guidance
he
looked
at
the
stars
twinkling
high
above
the
distant
libyan
plateau
at
the
long
arms
of
the
desert
gleaming
weirdly
white
in
the
moonlight
and
reaching
towards
him
down
every
opening
between
the
houses
at
the
heavy
mass
of
the
mokattam
hills
guarding
the
arabian
wilderness
with
strange
peaked
barriers
their
ridges
dark
and
still
above
the
wadi
hof
these
questionings
attracted
no
response
the
desert
watched
him
but
it
did
not
answer
there
was
only
the
shrill
whistling
cry
of
the
lizards
and
the
of
a
arab
gliding
down
the
sandy
street
and
through
these
sounds
he
heard
his
own
voice
answer
i
will
come
yes
but
how
can
i
help
tell
me
what
you
propose
your
plan
and
the
face
of
vance
seen
plainly
in
the
electric
glare
betrayed
his
satisfaction
the
opposing
things
in
the
fellow
mind
of
darkness
fought
visibly
in
his
eyes
and
skin
the
sordid
motive
planning
a
dreadful
act
leaped
to
his
face
and
with
it
a
flash
of
this
other
yearning
that
sought
unearthly
knowledge
perhaps
believed
it
too
no
wonder
there
was
conflict
written
on
his
features
then
all
expression
vanished
again
he
leaned
forward
lowering
his
voice
you
remember
our
conversation
about
there
being
types
of
life
too
vast
to
manifest
in
a
single
body
and
my
aunt
belief
that
these
were
known
to
certain
of
the
older
religious
systems
of
the
world
perfectly
her
experiment
then
is
to
bring
one
of
these
great
powers
back
we
possess
the
sympathetic
ritual
that
can
rouse
some
among
them
to
activity
and
win
it
down
into
the
sphere
of
our
minds
our
minds
heightened
you
see
by
ceremonial
to
that
stage
of
clairvoyant
vision
which
can
perceive
them
and
then
they
might
have
been
discussing
the
building
of
a
house
so
naturally
followed
answer
upon
question
but
the
whole
body
of
meaning
in
the
old
egyptian
symbolism
rushed
over
him
with
a
force
that
shook
his
heart
memory
came
so
marvellously
with
it
if
the
power
floods
down
into
our
minds
with
sufficient
strength
for
actual
form
to
note
the
outline
of
such
form
and
from
your
drawing
model
it
later
in
permanent
substance
then
we
should
have
means
of
evoking
it
at
will
for
we
should
have
its
natural
body
the
form
it
built
itself
its
signature
image
pattern
a
you
see
for
more
leading
she
hopes
to
a
complete
reconstruction
it
might
take
actual
shape
assume
a
bodily
form
visible
to
the
eye
repeated
henriot
amazed
as
before
that
doubt
and
laughter
did
not
break
through
his
mind
we
are
on
the
earth
was
the
reply
spoken
unnecessarily
low
since
no
living
thing
was
within
earshot
we
are
in
physical
conditions
are
we
not
even
a
human
soul
we
do
not
recognise
unless
we
see
it
in
a
body
parents
provide
the
outline
the
signature
the
sigil
of
the
returning
soul
this
and
he
tapped
himself
upon
the
breast
is
the
physical
signature
of
that
type
of
life
we
call
a
soul
unless
there
is
life
of
a
certain
strength
behind
it
no
body
forms
and
without
a
body
we
are
helpless
to
control
or
manage
it
deal
with
it
in
any
way
we
could
not
know
it
though
being
possibly
of
it
to
be
aware
you
mean
is
not
sufficient
for
he
noticed
the
italics
vance
made
use
of
too
vague
of
no
value
for
future
use
was
the
reply
but
once
obtain
the
form
and
we
have
the
natural
symbol
of
that
particular
power
and
a
symbol
is
more
than
image
it
is
a
direct
and
concentrated
expression
of
the
life
it
typifies
possibly
terrific
it
may
be
a
body
then
this
symbol
you
speak
of
accurate
vehicle
of
manifestation
but
seems
the
simplest
word
vance
answered
very
slowly
and
deliberately
as
though
weighing
how
much
he
would
tell
his
language
was
admirably
evasive
few
perhaps
would
have
detected
the
profound
significance
the
curious
words
he
next
used
unquestionably
concealed
henriot
mind
rejected
them
but
his
heart
accepted
for
the
ancient
soul
in
him
was
listening
and
aware
life
using
matter
to
express
itself
in
bodily
shape
first
traces
a
geometrical
pattern
from
the
lowest
form
in
crystals
upwards
to
more
complicated
patterns
in
the
higher
organisations
there
is
always
first
this
geometrical
pattern
as
skeleton
for
geometry
lies
at
the
root
of
all
possible
phenomena
and
is
the
mind
interpretation
of
a
living
movement
towards
shape
that
shall
express
it
he
brought
his
eyes
closer
to
the
other
lowering
his
voice
again
hence
he
said
softly
the
signs
in
all
the
old
magical
systems
skeleton
forms
into
which
the
powers
evoked
descended
outlines
those
powers
automatically
built
up
when
using
matter
to
express
themselves
such
signs
are
material
symbols
of
their
bodiless
existence
they
attract
the
life
they
represent
and
interpret
obtain
the
correct
true
symbol
and
the
power
corresponding
to
it
can
approach
once
roused
and
made
aware
it
has
you
see
a
mould
into
which
it
can
come
down
once
roused
and
made
aware
repeated
henriot
questioningly
while
this
man
went
stammering
the
letters
of
a
language
that
he
himself
had
used
too
long
ago
to
recapture
fully
because
they
have
left
the
world
they
sleep
unmanifested
their
forms
are
no
longer
known
to
men
no
forms
exist
on
earth
that
could
contain
them
but
they
may
be
awakened
he
added
darkly
they
are
bound
to
answer
to
the
summons
if
such
summons
be
accurately
made
evocation
whispered
henriot
more
distressed
than
he
cared
to
admit
vance
nodded
leaning
still
closer
to
his
companion
face
he
thrust
his
lips
forward
speaking
eagerly
earnestly
yet
somehow
at
the
same
time
horribly
and
we
want
my
aunt
would
ask
your
skill
or
at
any
rate
your
memory
afterwards
to
establish
the
outline
of
anything
that
comes
he
waited
for
the
answer
still
keeping
his
face
uncomfortably
close
henriot
drew
back
a
little
but
his
mind
was
fully
made
up
now
he
had
known
from
the
beginning
that
he
would
consent
for
the
desire
in
him
was
stronger
than
all
the
caution
in
the
world
the
past
inexorably
drew
him
into
the
circle
of
these
other
lives
and
the
little
human
dread
vance
woke
in
him
seemed
just
then
insignificant
by
comparison
it
was
merely
of
you
two
he
said
trying
to
bring
judgment
into
it
engaged
in
evocation
will
be
in
a
state
of
clairvoyant
vision
granted
but
shall
i
as
an
outsider
observing
with
unexcited
mind
see
anything
know
anything
be
aware
of
anything
at
all
let
alone
the
drawing
of
it
unless
the
reply
came
instantly
with
decision
the
descent
of
power
is
strong
enough
to
take
actual
material
shape
the
experiment
is
a
failure
anybody
can
induce
subjective
vision
such
fantasies
have
no
value
though
they
are
born
of
an
overwrought
imagination
and
then
he
added
quickly
as
though
to
clinch
the
matter
before
caution
and
hesitation
could
take
effect
you
must
watch
from
the
heights
above
we
shall
be
in
the
valley
the
wadi
hof
is
the
place
you
must
not
be
too
close
why
not
too
close
asked
henriot
springing
forward
like
a
flash
before
he
could
prevent
the
sudden
impulse
with
a
quickness
equal
to
his
own
vance
answered
there
was
no
faintest
sign
that
he
was
surprised
his
was
perfect
only
the
glare
passed
darkly
through
his
eyes
and
went
back
again
into
the
sombre
soul
that
bore
it
for
your
own
safety
he
answered
low
the
power
the
type
of
life
she
would
waken
is
stupendous
and
if
roused
enough
to
be
attracted
by
the
patterned
symbol
into
which
she
would
decoy
it
down
it
will
take
actual
physical
expression
but
how
where
is
the
body
of
worshippers
through
whom
it
can
manifest
there
is
none
it
will
therefore
press
inanimate
matter
into
the
service
the
terrific
impulse
to
form
itself
a
means
of
expression
will
force
all
loose
matter
at
hand
towards
it
sand
stones
all
it
can
compel
to
yield
everything
must
rush
into
the
sphere
of
action
in
which
it
operates
alone
we
at
the
centre
and
you
upon
the
outer
fringe
will
be
safe
only
you
must
not
come
too
close
but
henriot
was
no
longer
listening
his
soul
had
turned
to
ice
for
here
in
this
unguarded
moment
the
cloven
hoof
had
plainly
shown
itself
in
that
suggestion
of
a
particular
kind
of
danger
vance
had
lifted
a
corner
of
the
curtain
behind
which
crouched
his
horrible
intention
vance
desired
a
witness
of
the
extraordinary
experiment
but
he
desired
this
witness
not
merely
for
the
purpose
of
sketching
possible
shapes
that
might
present
themselves
to
excited
vision
he
desired
a
witness
for
another
reason
too
why
had
vance
put
that
idea
into
his
mind
this
idea
of
so
peculiar
danger
it
might
well
have
lost
him
the
very
assistance
he
seemed
so
anxious
to
obtain
henriot
could
not
fathom
it
quite
only
one
thing
was
clear
to
him
he
henriot
was
not
the
only
one
in
danger
they
talked
for
long
after
that
far
into
the
night
the
lights
went
out
and
the
armed
patrol
pacing
to
and
fro
outside
the
iron
railings
that
kept
the
desert
back
eyed
them
curiously
but
the
only
other
thing
he
gathered
of
importance
was
the
ledge
upon
the
where
he
was
to
stand
and
watch
that
he
was
expected
to
reach
there
before
sunset
and
wait
till
the
moon
concealed
all
glimmer
in
the
western
sky
and
that
the
woman
who
had
been
engaged
for
days
in
secret
preparation
of
soul
and
body
for
the
awful
rite
would
not
be
visible
again
until
he
saw
her
in
the
depths
of
the
black
valley
far
below
busy
with
this
man
upon
audacious
ancient
purposes
ix
an
hour
before
sunset
henriot
put
his
rugs
and
food
upon
a
donkey
and
gave
the
boy
directions
where
to
meet
him
a
considerable
distance
from
the
appointed
spot
he
went
himself
on
foot
he
slipped
in
the
heat
along
the
sandy
street
where
strings
of
camels
still
go
slouching
shuffling
with
their
loads
from
the
quarries
that
built
the
pyramids
and
he
felt
that
little
friendly
helouan
tried
to
keep
him
back
but
desire
now
was
far
too
strong
for
caution
the
desert
tide
was
rising
it
easily
swept
him
down
the
long
white
street
towards
the
enormous
deeps
beyond
he
felt
the
pull
of
a
thousand
miles
before
him
and
twice
a
thousand
years
drove
at
his
back
everything
still
basked
in
the
sunshine
he
passed
al
hayat
the
stately
hotel
that
dominates
the
village
like
a
palace
built
against
the
sky
and
in
its
pillared
colonnades
and
terraces
he
saw
the
throngs
of
people
having
late
afternoon
tea
and
listening
to
the
music
of
a
regimental
band
men
in
flannels
were
playing
tennis
parties
were
climbing
off
donkeys
after
long
excursions
there
was
laughter
talking
a
babel
of
many
voices
the
gaiety
called
to
him
the
everyday
spirit
whispered
to
stay
and
join
the
crowd
of
lively
human
beings
soon
there
would
be
merry
dancing
voices
of
pretty
women
sweet
white
dresses
singing
and
the
rest
soft
eyes
would
question
and
turn
dark
he
picked
out
several
girls
he
knew
among
the
palms
but
it
was
all
many
oh
so
many
leagues
away
centuries
lay
between
him
and
this
modern
world
an
indescriable
loneliness
was
in
his
heart
he
went
searching
through
the
sands
of
forgotten
ages
and
wandering
among
the
ruins
of
a
vanished
time
he
hurried
already
the
deeper
water
caught
his
breath
he
climbed
the
steep
rise
towards
the
plateau
where
the
observatory
stands
and
saw
two
of
the
officials
whom
he
knew
taking
a
siesta
after
their
long
day
work
he
felt
that
his
mind
too
had
dived
and
searched
among
the
heavenly
bodies
that
live
in
silent
changeless
peace
remote
from
the
world
of
men
they
recognised
him
these
two
whose
eyes
also
knew
tremendous
distance
close
they
beckoned
waving
the
straws
through
which
they
sipped
their
drinks
from
tall
glasses
their
voices
floated
down
to
him
as
from
the
he
saw
the
sun
gleam
upon
the
glasses
and
heard
the
clink
of
the
ice
against
the
sides
the
stillness
was
amazing
he
waved
an
answer
and
passed
quickly
on
he
could
not
stop
this
sliding
current
of
the
years
the
tide
moved
faster
the
draw
of
cycles
urging
it
he
emerged
upon
the
plateau
and
met
the
cooler
desert
air
his
feet
went
crunching
on
the
that
spread
its
curious
dark
shiny
carpet
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
it
lay
everywhere
unswept
and
smooth
as
when
the
feet
of
vanished
civilizations
trod
its
burning
surface
then
dipped
behind
the
curtains
time
pins
against
the
stars
and
here
the
body
of
the
tide
set
all
one
way
there
was
a
greater
strength
of
current
draught
and
suction
he
felt
the
powerful
undertow
deeper
masses
drew
his
feet
sideways
and
he
felt
the
rushing
of
the
central
body
of
the
sand
the
sands
were
moving
from
their
foundation
upwards
he
went
unresistingly
with
them
turning
a
moment
he
looked
back
at
shining
little
helouan
in
the
blaze
of
evening
light
the
voices
reached
him
very
faintly
merged
now
in
a
general
murmur
beyond
lay
the
strip
of
delta
vivid
green
the
palms
the
roofs
of
bedrashein
the
blue
laughter
of
the
nile
with
its
flocks
of
curved
felucca
sails
further
still
rising
above
the
yellow
libyan
horizon
gloomed
the
vast
triangles
of
a
dozen
pyramids
cutting
their
clefts
out
of
a
sky
fast
crimsoning
through
a
sea
of
gold
seen
thus
their
dignity
imposed
upon
the
entire
landscape
they
towered
darkly
symbolic
signatures
of
the
ancient
powers
that
now
watched
him
taking
these
little
steps
across
their
damaged
territory
he
gazed
a
minute
then
went
on
he
saw
the
big
pale
face
of
the
moon
in
the
east
above
the
thing
these
giant
symbols
once
interpreted
she
rose
grand
effortless
as
themselves
and
with
her
she
lifted
up
this
tide
of
the
desert
that
drew
his
feet
across
the
sand
to
wadi
hof
a
moment
later
he
dipped
below
the
ridge
that
buried
helouan
and
nile
and
pyramids
from
sight
he
entered
the
ancient
waters
time
then
in
an
instant
flowed
back
behind
his
footsteps
obliterating
every
trace
and
with
it
his
mind
went
too
he
stepped
across
the
gulf
of
centuries
moving
into
the
past
the
desert
lay
before
him
an
open
tomb
wherein
his
soul
should
read
presently
of
things
long
vanished
the
strange
of
sunset
began
to
play
their
witchery
then
upon
the
landscape
a
purple
glow
came
down
upon
the
mokattam
hills
perspective
danced
its
tricks
of
false
incredible
deception
the
soaring
kites
that
were
a
mile
away
seemed
suddenly
close
passing
in
a
moment
from
the
size
of
gnats
to
birds
with
a
fabulous
stretch
of
wing
ridges
and
cliffs
rushed
close
without
a
hint
of
warning
and
level
places
sank
into
declivities
and
basins
that
made
him
trip
and
stumble
that
indescribable
quality
of
the
desert
which
makes
timid
souls
avoid
the
hour
of
dusk
emerged
it
spread
everywhere
undisguised
and
the
bewilderment
it
brings
is
no
vain
imagined
thing
for
it
distorts
vision
utterly
and
the
effect
upon
the
mind
when
familiar
sight
goes
floundering
is
the
simplest
way
in
the
world
of
dragging
the
anchor
that
grips
reality
at
the
hour
of
sunset
this
bewilderment
comes
upon
a
man
with
a
disconcerting
swiftness
it
rose
now
with
all
this
weird
rapidity
henriot
found
himself
enveloped
at
a
moment
notice
but
knowing
well
its
effect
he
tried
to
judge
it
and
pass
on
the
other
matters
the
object
of
his
journey
chief
of
all
he
refused
to
dwell
upon
with
any
imagination
wisely
his
mind
while
never
losing
sight
of
it
declined
to
admit
the
exaggeration
that
thinking
brings
i
going
to
witness
an
incredible
experiment
in
which
two
enthusiastic
religious
dreamers
believe
firmly
he
repeated
to
himself
i
have
agreed
to
draw
anything
i
see
there
may
be
truth
in
it
or
they
may
be
merely
vision
due
to
an
artificial
exaltation
of
their
minds
i
interested
perhaps
against
my
better
judgment
yet
i
see
the
adventure
out
because
i
this
was
the
attitude
he
told
himself
to
take
whether
it
was
the
real
one
or
merely
adopted
to
warm
a
cooling
courage
he
could
not
tell
the
emotions
were
so
complex
and
warring
his
mind
automatically
kept
repeating
this
comforting
formula
deeper
than
that
he
could
not
see
to
judge
for
a
man
who
knew
the
full
content
of
his
thought
at
such
a
time
would
solve
some
of
the
oldest
psychological
problems
in
the
world
sand
had
already
buried
judgment
and
with
it
all
attempt
to
explain
the
adventure
by
the
standards
acceptable
to
his
brain
of
he
steered
subconsciously
through
a
world
of
dim
huge
wonders
the
sun
with
that
abrupt
egyptian
suddenness
was
below
the
horizon
now
the
pyramid
field
had
swallowed
it
ra
in
his
golden
boat
sailed
distant
seas
beyond
the
libyan
wilderness
henriot
walked
on
and
on
aware
of
utter
loneliness
he
was
walking
fields
of
dream
too
remote
from
modern
life
to
recall
companionship
he
once
had
surely
known
how
dim
it
was
how
deep
and
distant
how
lost
in
this
sea
of
an
incalculable
past
he
walked
into
the
places
that
are
soundless
the
soundlessness
of
ocean
miles
below
the
surface
was
about
him
he
was
with
one
only
this
unfathomable
silent
thing
where
nothing
breathes
or
stirs
nothing
but
sunshine
shadow
and
the
sand
slowly
in
front
the
moon
climbed
up
the
eastern
sky
hanging
above
the
silence
silence
that
ran
unbroken
across
the
horizons
to
where
suez
gleamed
upon
the
waters
of
a
sister
sea
in
motion
that
moon
was
glinting
now
upon
the
arabian
mountains
by
its
desolate
shores
southwards
stretched
the
wastes
of
upper
egypt
a
thousand
miles
to
meet
the
nubian
wilderness
but
over
all
these
separate
deserts
stirred
the
soft
whisper
of
the
moving
sand
deep
murmuring
message
that
life
was
on
the
way
to
unwind
death
the
ka
of
egypt
swathed
in
centuries
of
sand
hovered
beneath
the
moon
towards
her
ancient
tenement
for
the
transformation
of
the
desert
now
began
in
earnest
it
grew
apace
before
he
had
gone
the
first
two
miles
of
his
hour
journey
the
twilight
caught
the
rocky
hills
and
twisted
them
into
those
monstrous
revelations
of
physiognomies
they
barely
take
the
trouble
to
conceal
even
in
the
daytime
and
while
he
well
understood
the
eroding
agencies
that
have
produced
them
there
yet
rose
in
his
mind
a
deeper
interpretation
lurking
just
behind
their
literal
meanings
here
through
the
motionless
surfaces
that
nameless
thing
the
desert
ill
conceals
urged
outwards
into
embryonic
form
and
shape
akin
he
almost
felt
to
those
immense
deific
symbols
of
other
life
the
egyptians
knew
and
worshipped
hence
from
the
desert
had
first
come
he
felt
the
unearthly
life
they
typified
in
their
monstrous
figures
of
granite
evoked
in
their
stately
temples
and
communed
with
in
the
ritual
of
their
mystery
ceremonials
this
watching
aspect
of
the
libyan
desert
is
really
natural
enough
but
it
is
just
the
natural
henriot
knew
that
brings
the
deepest
revelations
the
surface
limestones
resisting
the
erosion
block
themselves
ominously
against
the
sky
while
the
softer
sand
beneath
sets
them
on
altared
pedestals
that
define
their
isolation
splendidly
blunt
and
unconquerable
these
masses
now
watched
him
pass
between
them
the
desert
surface
formed
them
gave
them
birth
they
rose
they
saw
they
sank
down
again
waves
upon
a
sea
that
carried
forgotten
life
up
from
the
depths
below
of
forbidding
even
menacing
type
they
somewhere
mated
with
genuine
grandeur
unformed
according
to
any
standard
of
human
or
of
animal
faces
they
achieved
an
air
of
giant
physiognomy
which
made
them
terrible
the
unwinking
stare
of
eyes
lidless
eyes
that
yet
ever
succeed
in
hiding
looked
out
under
level
eyebrows
suggesting
a
vision
that
included
the
motives
and
purposes
of
his
very
heart
they
looked
up
grandly
understood
why
he
was
there
and
then
slowly
withdrew
their
mysterious
penetrating
gaze
the
strata
built
them
so
marvellously
up
the
heavy
threatening
brows
thick
lips
curved
by
the
ages
into
a
semblance
of
cold
smiles
jowls
drooping
into
sandy
heaps
that
climbed
against
the
cheeks
protruding
jaws
and
the
suggestion
of
shoulders
just
about
to
lift
the
entire
bodies
out
of
the
sandy
beds
this
host
of
countenances
conveyed
a
solemnity
of
expression
that
seemed
everlasting
implacable
as
death
of
human
signature
they
bore
no
trace
nor
was
comparison
possible
between
their
kind
and
any
animal
life
they
peopled
the
desert
here
and
their
smiles
concealed
yet
just
discernible
went
broadening
with
the
darkness
into
a
desert
laughter
the
silence
bore
it
underground
but
henriot
was
aware
of
it
the
troop
of
faces
slipped
into
that
single
enormous
countenance
which
is
the
visage
of
the
sand
and
he
saw
it
everywhere
yet
nowhere
thus
with
the
darkness
grew
his
imaginative
interpretation
of
the
desert
yet
there
was
construction
in
it
a
construction
moreover
that
was
entirely
his
own
powers
he
felt
were
rising
stirring
wakening
from
sleep
behind
the
natural
faces
that
he
saw
these
other
things
peered
gravely
at
him
as
he
passed
they
used
as
it
were
materials
that
lay
ready
to
their
hand
imagination
furnished
these
hints
of
outline
yet
the
powers
themselves
were
real
there
this
amazing
movement
of
the
sand
by
no
other
manner
could
his
mind
have
conceived
of
such
a
thing
nor
dreamed
of
this
simple
yet
dreadful
method
of
approach
approach
that
was
the
word
that
first
stood
out
and
startled
him
there
was
approach
something
was
drawing
nearer
the
desert
rose
and
walked
beside
him
for
not
alone
these
ribs
of
gleaming
limestone
contributed
towards
the
elemental
visages
but
the
entire
hills
of
which
they
were
an
outcrop
ran
to
assist
in
the
formation
and
were
a
necessary
part
of
them
he
was
watched
and
stared
at
from
behind
in
front
on
either
side
and
even
from
below
the
sand
that
swept
him
on
kept
even
pace
with
him
it
turned
luminous
too
with
a
patchwork
of
glimmering
effect
that
was
indescribably
weird
lanterns
glowed
within
its
substance
and
by
their
light
he
stumbled
on
glad
of
the
arab
boy
he
would
presently
meet
at
the
appointed
place
the
last
torch
of
the
sunset
had
flickered
out
melting
into
the
wilderness
when
suddenly
opening
at
his
feet
gaped
the
deep
wide
gully
known
as
wadi
hof
its
curve
swept
past
him
this
first
impression
came
upon
him
with
a
certain
violence
that
the
desolate
valley
rushed
he
saw
but
a
section
of
its
curve
and
sweep
but
through
its
entire
length
of
several
miles
the
wadi
fled
away
the
moon
whitened
it
like
snow
piling
black
shadows
very
close
against
the
cliffs
in
the
flood
of
moonlight
it
went
rushing
past
it
was
emptying
itself
for
a
moment
the
stream
of
movement
seemed
to
pause
and
look
up
into
his
face
then
instantly
went
on
again
upon
its
swift
career
it
was
like
the
procession
of
a
river
to
the
sea
the
valley
emptied
itself
to
make
way
for
what
was
coming
the
approach
moreover
had
already
begun
conscious
that
he
was
trembling
he
stood
and
gazed
into
the
depths
seeking
to
steady
his
mind
by
the
repetition
of
the
little
formula
he
had
used
before
he
said
it
half
aloud
but
while
he
did
so
his
heart
whispered
quite
other
things
thoughts
the
woman
and
the
man
had
sown
rose
up
in
a
flock
and
fell
upon
him
like
a
storm
of
sand
their
impetus
drove
off
all
support
of
ordinary
ideas
they
shook
him
where
he
stood
staring
down
into
this
river
of
strange
invisible
movement
that
was
hundreds
of
feet
in
depth
and
a
quarter
of
a
mile
across
he
sought
to
realise
himself
as
he
actually
was
mere
visitor
to
helouan
tempted
into
this
wild
adventure
with
two
strangers
but
in
vain
that
seemed
a
dream
unreal
a
transient
detail
picked
out
from
the
enormous
past
that
now
engulfed
him
heart
and
mind
and
soul
was
the
reality
the
shapes
and
faces
that
the
hills
of
sand
built
round
him
were
the
play
of
excited
fancy
only
by
sheer
force
he
pinned
his
thought
against
this
fact
but
further
he
could
not
get
there
powers
at
work
they
were
being
stirred
wakened
somewhere
into
activity
evocation
had
already
begun
that
sense
of
their
approach
as
he
had
walked
along
from
helouan
was
not
imaginary
a
descent
of
some
type
of
life
vanished
from
the
world
too
long
for
recollection
was
on
the
way
so
vast
that
it
would
manifest
itself
in
a
group
of
forms
a
troop
a
host
an
army
these
two
were
near
him
somewhere
at
this
very
moment
already
long
at
work
their
minds
driving
beyond
this
little
world
the
valley
was
emptying
itself
for
the
descent
of
life
their
ritual
invited
and
the
movement
in
the
sand
was
likewise
true
he
recalled
the
sentences
the
woman
had
used
my
body
he
reflected
like
the
bodies
life
makes
use
of
everywhere
is
mere
upright
heap
of
earth
and
dust
and
sand
here
in
the
desert
is
the
raw
material
the
greatest
store
of
it
in
the
world
and
on
the
heels
of
it
came
sharply
that
other
thing
that
this
descending
life
would
press
into
its
service
all
loose
matter
within
its
reach
to
form
that
sphere
of
action
which
would
be
in
a
literal
sense
its
body
in
the
first
few
seconds
as
he
stood
there
he
realised
all
this
and
realised
it
with
an
overwhelming
conviction
it
was
futile
to
deny
the
valley
would
later
brim
with
an
unaccustomed
and
terrific
life
yet
death
hid
there
too
a
little
ugly
insignificant
death
with
the
name
of
vance
it
flashed
upon
his
mind
and
vanished
too
tiny
to
be
thought
about
in
this
torrent
of
grander
messages
that
shook
the
depths
within
his
soul
he
bowed
his
head
a
moment
hardly
knowing
what
he
did
he
could
have
waited
thus
a
thousand
years
it
seemed
he
was
conscious
of
a
wild
desire
to
run
away
to
hide
to
efface
himself
utterly
his
terror
his
curiosity
his
little
wonder
and
not
be
seen
of
anything
but
it
was
all
vain
and
foolish
the
desert
saw
him
the
gigantic
knew
that
he
was
there
no
escape
was
possible
any
longer
caught
by
the
sand
he
stood
amid
eternal
things
the
river
of
movement
swept
him
too
these
hills
now
motionless
as
statues
would
presently
glide
forward
into
the
cavalcade
sway
like
vessels
and
go
past
with
the
procession
at
present
only
the
contents
not
the
frame
of
the
wadi
moved
an
immense
soft
brush
of
moonlight
swept
it
empty
for
what
was
on
the
way
but
presently
the
entire
desert
would
stand
up
and
also
go
then
making
a
sideways
movement
his
feet
kicked
against
something
soft
and
yielding
that
lay
heaped
upon
the
desert
floor
and
henriot
discovered
the
rugs
the
arab
boy
had
carefully
set
down
before
he
made
full
speed
for
the
friendly
lights
of
helouan
the
sound
of
his
departing
footsteps
had
long
since
died
away
he
was
alone
the
detail
restored
to
him
his
consciousness
of
the
immediate
present
and
stooping
he
gathered
up
the
rugs
and
overcoat
and
began
to
make
preparations
for
the
night
but
the
appointed
spot
whence
he
was
to
watch
lay
upon
the
summit
of
the
opposite
cliffs
he
must
cross
the
wadi
bed
and
climb
slowly
and
with
labour
he
made
his
way
down
a
steep
cleft
into
the
depth
of
the
wadi
hof
sliding
and
stumbling
often
till
at
length
he
stood
upon
the
floor
of
shining
moonlight
it
was
very
smooth
windless
utterly
still
as
space
each
particle
of
sand
lay
in
its
ancient
place
asleep
the
movement
it
seemed
had
ceased
he
clambered
next
up
the
eastern
side
through
shadows
and
within
the
hour
reached
the
ledge
upon
the
top
whence
he
could
see
below
him
like
a
silvered
map
the
sweep
of
the
valley
bed
the
wind
nipped
keenly
here
again
coming
over
the
leagues
of
cooling
sand
loose
boulders
of
splintered
rock
started
by
his
climbing
crashed
and
boomed
into
the
depths
he
banked
the
rugs
behind
him
wrapped
himself
in
his
overcoat
and
lay
down
to
wait
behind
him
was
a
crumbling
wall
against
which
he
leaned
in
front
a
drop
of
several
hundred
feet
through
space
he
lay
upon
a
platform
therefore
invisible
from
the
desert
at
his
back
below
the
curving
wadi
formed
a
natural
amphitheatre
in
which
each
separate
boulder
fallen
from
the
cliffs
and
even
the
little
shrubs
the
camels
eat
were
plainly
visible
he
noted
all
the
bigger
ones
among
them
he
counted
them
over
half
aloud
and
the
moving
stream
he
had
been
unaware
of
when
crossing
the
bed
itself
now
began
again
the
wadi
went
rushing
past
before
the
broom
of
moonlight
again
the
enormous
and
the
tiny
combined
in
one
single
strange
impression
for
through
this
conception
of
great
movement
stirred
also
a
roving
delicate
touch
that
his
imagination
felt
as
behind
the
solid
mass
of
the
desert
immobility
flashed
something
swift
and
light
and
airy
bizarre
pictures
interpreted
it
to
him
like
rapid
of
a
huge
flying
panorama
he
thought
of
darting
seen
at
helouan
of
children
little
dancing
feet
of
twinkling
butterflies
of
birds
chiefly
yes
of
a
flock
of
birds
in
flight
whose
separate
units
formed
a
single
entity
the
idea
of
the
possessed
his
mind
once
more
but
it
came
with
a
sense
of
more
than
curiosity
or
wonder
veneration
lay
behind
it
a
veneration
touched
with
awe
it
rose
in
his
deepest
thought
that
here
was
the
first
hint
of
a
symbolical
representation
a
symbol
sacred
and
inviolable
belonging
to
some
ancient
worship
that
he
half
remembered
in
his
soul
stirred
towards
interpretation
through
all
his
being
he
lay
there
waiting
wondering
vaguely
where
his
two
companions
were
yet
fear
all
vanished
because
he
felt
attuned
to
a
scale
of
things
too
big
to
mate
with
definite
dread
there
was
high
anticipation
in
him
but
not
anxiety
of
himself
as
felix
henriot
indeed
he
hardly
seemed
aware
he
was
some
one
else
or
rather
he
was
himself
at
a
stage
he
had
known
once
far
far
away
in
a
remote
he
watched
himself
from
dim
summits
of
a
past
of
which
no
further
details
were
as
yet
recoverable
pencil
and
lay
ready
to
his
hand
the
moon
rose
higher
tucking
the
shadows
ever
more
closely
against
the
precipices
the
silver
passed
into
a
sheet
of
snowy
whiteness
that
made
every
boulder
clearly
visible
solemnity
deepened
everywhere
into
awe
the
wadi
fled
silently
down
the
stream
of
hours
it
was
almost
empty
now
and
then
abruptly
he
was
aware
of
change
the
motion
altered
somewhere
it
moved
more
quietly
pace
slackened
the
end
of
the
procession
that
evacuated
the
depth
and
length
of
it
went
trailing
past
and
turned
the
distant
bend
it
slowing
up
he
whispered
as
sure
of
it
as
though
he
had
watched
a
regiment
of
soldiers
filing
by
the
wind
took
off
his
voice
like
a
flying
feather
of
sound
and
there
a
change
it
had
begun
night
and
the
moon
stood
still
to
watch
and
listen
the
wind
dropped
utterly
away
the
sand
ceased
its
shifting
movement
the
desert
everywhere
stopped
still
and
turned
some
curtain
then
that
for
centuries
had
veiled
the
world
drew
softly
up
leaving
a
shaded
vista
down
which
the
eyes
of
his
soul
peered
towards
pictures
still
buried
by
the
sands
too
deep
for
full
recovery
he
yet
perceived
dim
portions
of
them
things
once
honoured
and
loved
passionately
for
once
they
had
surely
been
to
him
the
whole
of
life
not
merely
a
fragment
for
cheap
wonder
to
inspect
and
they
were
curiously
familiar
even
as
the
person
of
this
woman
who
now
evoked
them
was
familiar
henriot
made
no
pretence
to
more
definite
remembrance
but
the
haunting
certainty
rushed
over
him
deeper
than
doubt
or
denial
and
with
such
force
that
he
felt
no
effort
to
destroy
it
some
lost
sweetness
of
spiritual
ambitions
lived
for
with
this
passionate
devotion
and
passionately
worshipped
as
men
worship
fame
and
money
revived
in
him
with
a
tempest
of
high
glory
centres
of
memory
stirred
from
an
sleep
so
that
he
could
have
wept
at
their
so
complete
obliteration
hitherto
that
such
majesty
had
departed
from
the
world
as
though
it
never
had
existed
was
a
thought
for
desolation
and
for
tears
and
though
the
little
fragment
he
was
about
to
witness
might
be
crude
in
itself
and
incomplete
yet
it
was
part
of
a
vast
system
that
once
explored
the
richest
realms
of
deity
the
reverence
in
him
contained
a
holiness
of
the
night
and
of
the
stars
great
gentle
awe
lay
in
it
too
for
he
stood
aflame
with
anticipation
and
humility
at
the
gateway
of
sacred
things
and
this
was
the
mood
no
thrill
of
cheap
excitement
or
alarm
to
weaken
in
in
which
he
first
became
aware
that
two
spots
of
darkness
he
had
taken
all
along
for
boulders
on
the
snowy
valley
bed
were
actually
something
very
different
they
were
living
figures
they
moved
it
was
not
the
shadows
slowly
following
the
moonlight
but
the
stir
of
human
beings
who
all
these
hours
had
been
motionless
as
stone
he
must
have
passed
them
unnoticed
within
a
dozen
yards
when
he
crossed
the
wadi
bed
and
a
hundred
times
from
this
very
ledge
his
eyes
had
surely
rested
on
them
without
recognition
their
minds
he
knew
full
well
had
not
been
inactive
as
their
bodies
the
important
part
of
the
ancient
ritual
lay
he
remembered
in
the
powers
of
the
evoking
mind
here
indeed
was
no
effective
nor
theatrical
approach
of
the
principal
figures
it
had
nothing
in
common
with
the
cheap
external
ceremonial
of
modern
days
in
forgotten
powers
of
the
soul
its
grandeur
lay
potent
splendid
true
long
before
he
came
perhaps
all
through
the
day
these
two
had
laboured
with
their
arduous
preparations
they
were
there
part
of
the
desert
when
hours
ago
he
had
crossed
the
plateau
in
the
twilight
to
them
to
this
woman
potent
working
of
old
ceremonial
had
been
due
that
singular
rush
of
imagination
he
had
felt
he
had
interpreted
the
desert
as
alive
here
was
the
explanation
it
alive
life
was
on
the
way
long
latent
her
intense
desire
summoned
it
back
to
physical
expression
and
the
effect
upon
him
had
steadily
increased
as
he
drew
nearer
to
the
centre
where
she
would
focus
its
revival
and
return
those
singular
impressions
of
being
watched
and
accompanied
were
explained
a
priest
of
this
worship
performed
a
genuine
evocation
a
great
one
of
vision
revived
the
cosmic
powers
henriot
watched
the
small
figures
far
below
him
with
a
sense
of
dramatic
splendour
that
only
this
association
of
memory
could
account
for
it
was
their
rising
now
and
the
lifting
of
their
arms
to
form
a
slow
revolving
outline
that
marked
the
abrupt
cessation
of
the
larger
river
of
movement
for
the
sweeping
of
the
wadi
sank
into
sudden
stillness
and
these
two
with
motions
not
unlike
some
dance
of
deliberate
solemnity
passed
slowly
through
the
moonlight
to
and
fro
his
attention
fixed
upon
them
both
all
other
movement
ceased
they
fastened
the
flow
of
time
against
the
desert
body
what
happened
then
how
could
his
mind
interpret
an
experience
so
long
denied
that
the
power
of
expression
as
of
comprehension
has
ceased
to
exist
how
translate
this
symbolical
representation
small
detail
though
it
was
of
a
transcendent
worship
entombed
for
most
so
utterly
beyond
recovery
its
splendour
could
never
lodge
in
minds
that
conceive
deity
perched
upon
a
cloud
within
telephoning
distance
of
fashionable
churches
how
should
he
phrase
it
even
to
himself
whose
memory
drew
up
pictures
from
so
dim
a
past
that
the
language
fit
to
frame
them
lay
unreachable
and
lost
henriot
did
not
know
perhaps
he
never
yet
has
known
certainly
at
the
time
he
did
not
even
try
to
think
his
sensations
remain
his
own
untranslatable
and
even
that
instinctive
description
the
mind
gropes
for
automatically
floundered
halted
and
stopped
dead
yet
there
rose
within
him
somewhere
from
depths
long
drowned
in
slumber
a
reviving
power
by
which
he
saw
divined
and
recollected
remembered
seemed
too
literal
a
word
these
elements
of
a
worship
he
once
had
personally
known
he
too
had
worshipped
thus
his
soul
had
moved
amid
similar
evocations
in
some
aeonian
past
whence
now
the
sand
was
being
cleared
away
symbols
of
stupendous
meaning
flashed
and
went
their
way
across
the
lifting
mists
he
hardly
caught
their
meaning
so
long
it
was
since
he
had
known
them
yet
they
were
familiar
as
the
faces
seen
in
dreams
and
some
hint
of
their
spiritual
significance
left
faint
traces
in
his
heart
by
means
of
which
their
grandeur
reached
towards
interpretation
and
all
were
symbols
of
a
cosmic
deific
nature
of
powers
that
only
symbols
can
express
and
sacraments
used
in
the
wisdom
religion
of
an
older
time
but
known
only
in
the
decrepit
literal
shell
which
is
their
degradation
grandly
the
figures
moved
across
the
valley
bed
the
powers
of
the
heavenly
bodies
once
more
joined
them
they
moved
to
the
measure
of
a
cosmic
dance
whose
rhythm
was
creative
the
universe
partnered
them
there
was
this
transfiguration
of
all
common
external
things
he
realised
that
appearances
were
visible
letters
of
a
soundless
language
a
language
he
once
had
known
the
powers
of
night
and
moon
and
desert
sand
married
with
points
in
the
fluid
stream
of
his
inmost
spiritual
being
that
knew
and
welcomed
them
he
understood
old
egypt
herself
stooped
down
from
her
uncovered
throne
the
stars
sent
messengers
there
was
commotion
in
the
secret
sandy
places
of
the
desert
for
the
desert
had
grown
temple
columns
reared
against
the
sky
there
rose
from
leagues
away
the
chanting
of
the
sand
the
temples
where
once
this
came
to
pass
were
gone
their
ruin
questioned
by
alien
hearts
that
knew
not
their
spiritual
meaning
but
here
the
entire
desert
swept
in
to
form
a
shrine
and
the
majesty
that
once
was
egypt
stepped
grandly
back
across
ages
of
denial
and
neglect
the
sand
was
altar
and
the
stars
were
altar
lights
the
moon
lit
up
the
vast
recesses
of
the
ceiling
and
the
wind
from
a
thousand
miles
brought
in
the
perfume
of
her
incense
for
with
that
faith
which
shifts
mountains
from
their
sandy
bed
two
passionate
believing
souls
invoked
the
ka
of
egypt
and
the
motions
that
they
made
he
saw
were
definite
harmonious
patterns
their
dark
figures
traced
upon
the
shining
valley
floor
like
the
points
of
compasses
with
stems
invisible
and
directed
from
the
sky
their
movements
marked
the
outlines
of
great
signatures
of
power
the
sigils
of
the
type
of
life
they
would
evoke
it
would
come
as
a
procession
no
individual
outline
could
contain
it
it
needed
for
its
visible
expression
many
the
descent
of
a
known
to
the
worship
of
this
mighty
system
rose
from
its
lair
of
centuries
and
moved
hugely
down
upon
them
the
ka
answering
to
the
summons
would
mate
with
sand
the
desert
was
its
body
yet
it
was
not
this
that
he
had
come
to
fix
with
block
and
pencil
not
yet
was
the
moment
when
his
skill
might
be
of
use
he
waited
watched
and
listened
while
this
river
of
things
went
past
him
the
patterns
grew
beneath
his
eyes
like
music
too
intricate
and
prolonged
to
remember
with
accuracy
later
he
understood
that
they
were
forms
of
that
which
lies
behind
all
manifested
life
the
mould
was
being
traced
in
outline
life
would
presently
inform
it
and
a
singing
rose
from
the
maze
of
lines
whose
beauty
was
like
the
beauty
of
the
constellations
this
sound
was
very
faint
at
first
but
grew
steadily
in
volume
although
no
echoes
properly
speaking
were
possible
these
precipices
caught
stray
notes
that
trooped
in
from
the
further
sandy
reaches
the
figures
certainly
were
chanting
but
their
chanting
was
not
all
he
heard
other
sounds
came
to
his
ears
from
far
away
running
past
him
through
the
air
from
every
side
and
from
incredible
distances
all
flocking
down
into
the
wadi
bed
to
join
the
parent
note
that
summoned
them
the
desert
was
giving
voice
and
memory
lifting
her
hood
yet
higher
showed
more
of
her
grey
mysterious
face
that
searched
his
soul
with
questions
had
he
so
soon
forgotten
that
strange
union
of
form
and
sound
which
once
was
known
to
the
evocative
rituals
of
olden
days
henriot
tried
patiently
to
disentangle
this
that
their
intoning
voices
woke
from
the
humming
of
the
blood
in
his
own
veins
but
he
succeeded
only
in
part
sand
was
already
in
the
air
there
was
reverberation
rhythm
measure
there
was
almost
the
breaking
of
the
stream
into
great
syllables
but
was
it
due
this
strange
reverberation
to
the
countless
particles
of
sand
meeting
in
about
him
or
to
larger
bodies
whose
surfaces
caught
this
friction
of
the
sand
and
threw
it
back
against
his
ears
the
wind
now
rising
brought
particles
that
stung
his
face
and
hands
and
filled
his
eyes
with
a
minute
fine
dust
that
partially
veiled
the
moonlight
but
was
not
something
larger
vaster
these
particles
composed
now
also
on
the
way
movement
and
sound
and
flying
sand
thus
merged
themselves
more
and
more
in
a
single
whirling
torrent
but
henriot
sought
no
commonplace
explanation
of
what
he
witnessed
and
here
was
the
proof
that
all
happened
in
some
vestibule
of
inner
experience
where
the
strain
of
question
and
answer
had
no
business
one
sitting
beside
him
need
not
have
seen
anything
at
all
his
host
for
instance
from
helouan
need
not
have
been
aware
night
screened
it
helouan
as
the
whole
of
modern
experience
stood
in
front
of
the
screen
this
thing
took
place
behind
it
he
crouched
motionless
watching
in
some
reconstructed
of
the
soul
while
the
torrent
grew
into
a
veritable
tempest
yet
night
remained
unshaken
the
veil
of
moonlight
did
not
quiver
the
stars
dropped
their
slender
golden
pillars
unobstructed
calmness
reigned
everywhere
as
before
the
stupendous
representation
passed
on
behind
it
all
but
the
dignity
of
the
little
human
movements
that
he
watched
had
become
now
indescribable
the
gestures
of
the
arms
and
bodies
invested
themselves
with
consummate
grandeur
as
these
two
strode
into
the
caverns
behind
manifested
life
and
drew
forth
symbols
that
represented
vanished
powers
the
sound
of
their
chanting
voices
broke
in
cadenced
fragments
against
the
shores
of
language
the
words
henriot
never
actually
caught
if
words
they
were
yet
he
understood
their
purport
these
names
of
power
to
which
the
type
of
returning
life
gave
answer
as
they
approached
he
remembered
fumbling
for
his
drawing
materials
with
such
violence
however
that
the
pencil
snapped
in
two
between
his
fingers
as
he
touched
it
for
now
even
here
upon
the
outer
fringe
of
the
ceremonial
ground
there
was
a
stir
of
forces
that
set
the
very
muscles
working
in
him
before
he
had
become
aware
of
it
then
came
the
moment
when
his
heart
leaped
against
his
ribs
with
a
sudden
violence
that
was
almost
pain
standing
a
second
later
still
as
death
the
lines
upon
the
valley
floor
ceased
their
dance
all
movement
stopped
sound
died
away
in
the
midst
of
this
profound
and
dreadful
silence
the
sigils
lay
empty
there
below
him
they
waited
to
be
for
the
moment
of
entrance
had
come
at
last
life
was
close
and
he
understood
why
this
return
of
life
had
all
along
suggested
a
procession
and
could
be
no
mere
momentary
flash
of
vision
from
such
appalling
distance
did
it
sweep
down
towards
the
present
upon
this
network
then
of
splendid
lines
at
length
held
rigid
the
entire
desert
reared
itself
with
walls
of
curtained
sand
that
dwarfed
the
cliffs
the
shouldering
hills
the
very
sky
the
desert
stood
on
end
as
once
before
he
had
dreamed
it
from
his
balcony
windows
it
rose
upright
towering
and
close
against
his
face
it
built
sudden
ramparts
to
the
stars
that
chambered
the
thing
he
witnessed
behind
walls
no
centuries
could
ever
bring
down
crumbling
into
dust
he
himself
in
some
curious
fashion
lay
just
outside
viewing
it
apart
as
from
a
pinnacle
he
peered
within
peered
down
with
straining
eyes
into
the
vast
memory
threw
abruptly
open
and
the
picture
spaced
its
noble
outline
thus
against
the
very
stars
he
gazed
between
columns
that
supported
the
sky
itself
like
pillars
of
sand
that
swept
across
the
field
of
vanished
years
sand
poured
and
streamed
aside
laying
bare
the
past
for
down
the
enormous
vista
into
which
he
gazed
as
into
an
avenue
running
a
million
miles
towards
a
tiny
point
he
saw
this
moving
thing
that
came
towards
him
shaking
loose
the
countless
veils
of
sand
the
ages
had
swathed
about
it
the
ka
of
buried
egypt
wakened
out
of
sleep
she
had
heard
the
potent
summons
of
her
old
ritual
she
came
she
stretched
forth
an
arm
towards
the
worshippers
who
evoked
her
out
of
the
desert
out
of
the
leagues
of
sand
out
of
the
immeasurable
wilderness
which
was
her
mummied
form
and
body
she
rose
and
came
and
this
fragment
of
her
he
would
actually
see
this
little
portion
that
was
obedient
to
the
stammered
and
broken
ceremonial
the
partial
revelation
he
would
witness
yet
so
vast
even
this
little
bit
of
it
that
it
came
as
a
procession
and
a
host
for
a
moment
there
was
nothing
and
then
the
voice
of
the
woman
rose
in
a
resounding
cry
that
filled
the
wadi
to
its
furthest
precipices
before
it
died
away
again
to
silence
that
a
human
voice
could
produce
such
volume
accent
depth
seemed
half
incredible
the
walls
of
towering
sand
swallowed
it
instantly
but
the
procession
of
life
needing
a
group
a
host
an
army
for
its
physical
expression
reached
at
that
moment
the
nearer
end
of
the
huge
avenue
it
touched
the
present
it
entered
the
world
of
men
x
the
entire
range
of
henriot
experience
read
imagined
dreamed
then
fainted
into
unreality
before
the
sheer
wonder
of
what
he
saw
in
the
brief
interval
it
takes
to
snap
the
fingers
the
climax
was
thus
so
hurriedly
upon
him
and
through
it
all
he
was
clearly
aware
of
the
pair
of
little
human
figures
man
and
woman
standing
erect
and
commanding
at
the
centre
knew
too
that
she
directed
and
controlled
while
he
in
some
secondary
fashion
supported
her
and
ever
watched
but
both
were
dim
dropped
somewhere
into
a
lesser
scale
it
was
the
knowledge
of
their
presence
however
that
alone
enabled
him
to
keep
his
powers
in
hand
at
all
but
for
these
two
beings
there
within
possible
reach
he
must
have
closed
his
eyes
and
swooned
for
a
tempest
that
seemed
to
toss
loose
stars
about
the
sky
swept
round
about
him
pouring
up
the
pillared
avenue
in
front
of
the
procession
a
blast
of
giant
energy
of
liberty
came
through
forwards
and
backwards
circling
spirally
about
him
like
a
whirlwind
came
this
revival
of
life
that
sought
to
dip
itself
once
more
in
matter
and
in
form
it
came
to
the
accurate
of
its
form
they
had
traced
for
it
he
held
his
mind
steady
enough
to
realise
that
it
was
akin
to
what
men
call
a
descent
of
some
spiritual
movement
that
wakens
a
body
of
believers
into
faith
a
race
an
entire
nation
only
that
he
experienced
it
in
this
brief
concentrated
form
before
it
has
scattered
down
into
ten
thousand
hearts
here
he
knew
its
source
and
essence
behind
the
veil
crudely
unmanageable
as
yet
he
felt
it
rushing
loose
behind
appearances
there
was
this
amazing
impact
of
a
twisting
swinging
force
that
stormed
down
as
though
it
would
bend
and
coil
the
very
ribs
of
the
old
stubborn
hills
it
sought
to
warm
them
with
the
stress
of
its
own
irresistible
to
beat
them
into
shape
and
make
pliable
their
obstinate
resistance
through
all
things
the
impulse
poured
and
spread
like
fire
at
white
heat
yet
nothing
visible
came
as
yet
no
alteration
in
the
actual
landscape
no
sign
of
change
in
things
familiar
to
his
eyes
while
impetus
thus
fought
against
inertia
he
perceived
nothing
calm
and
untouched
himself
he
lay
outside
the
circle
of
evocation
watching
waiting
scarcely
daring
to
breathe
yet
well
aware
that
any
minute
the
scene
would
transfer
itself
from
memory
that
was
subjective
to
matter
that
was
objective
and
then
in
a
flash
the
bridge
was
built
and
the
transfer
was
accomplished
how
or
where
he
did
not
see
he
could
not
tell
it
was
there
before
he
knew
it
there
before
his
normal
earthly
sight
he
saw
it
as
he
saw
the
hands
he
was
holding
stupidly
up
to
shield
his
face
for
this
terrific
release
of
force
long
held
back
long
stored
up
latent
for
centuries
came
pouring
down
the
empty
wadi
bed
prepared
for
its
reception
through
stones
and
sand
and
boulders
it
came
in
an
impetuous
hurricane
of
power
the
liberation
of
its
life
appalled
him
all
that
was
free
untied
responded
instantly
like
chaff
loose
objects
fled
towards
it
there
was
a
yielding
in
the
hills
and
precipices
and
even
in
the
mass
of
desert
which
provided
their
foundation
the
hinges
of
the
sand
went
creaking
in
the
night
it
shaped
for
itself
a
bodily
outline
yet
most
strangely
nothing
definitely
moved
how
could
he
express
the
violent
contradiction
for
the
immobility
was
apparent
only
a
sham
a
counterfeit
while
behind
it
the
essential
of
these
things
did
rush
and
shift
and
alter
he
saw
the
two
things
side
by
side
the
outer
immobility
the
senses
commonly
agree
upon
this
amazing
of
their
inner
invisible
substance
towards
the
vortex
of
attracting
life
that
sucked
them
in
for
stubborn
matter
turned
docile
before
the
stress
of
this
returning
life
taught
somewhere
to
be
plastic
it
was
being
moulded
into
an
approach
to
bodily
outline
a
mobile
elasticity
invaded
rigid
substance
the
two
officiating
human
beings
safe
at
the
stationary
centre
and
himself
just
outside
the
circle
of
operation
alone
remained
untouched
and
unaffected
but
a
few
feet
in
any
direction
for
any
one
of
them
meant
instantaneous
death
they
would
be
absorbed
into
the
vortex
mere
corpuscles
pressed
into
the
service
of
this
sphere
of
action
of
a
mighty
body
how
these
perceptions
reached
him
with
such
conviction
henriot
could
never
say
he
knew
it
because
he
it
something
fell
about
him
from
the
sky
that
already
paled
towards
the
dawn
the
stars
themselves
it
seemed
contributed
some
part
of
the
terrific
flowing
impulse
that
conquered
matter
and
shaped
itself
this
physical
expression
then
before
he
was
able
to
fashion
any
preconceived
idea
of
what
visible
form
this
potent
life
might
assume
he
was
aware
of
further
change
it
came
at
the
briefest
possible
interval
after
the
beginning
this
certainty
that
to
and
fro
about
him
as
yet
however
indeterminate
passed
magnitudes
that
were
stupendous
as
the
desert
there
was
beauty
in
them
too
though
a
terrible
beauty
hardly
of
this
earth
at
all
a
fragment
of
old
egypt
had
returned
a
little
portion
of
that
vast
body
of
belief
that
once
was
egypt
evoked
by
the
worship
of
one
human
heart
passionately
sincere
the
ka
of
egypt
stepped
back
to
visit
the
material
it
once
informed
the
sand
yet
only
a
portion
came
henriot
clearly
realised
that
it
stretched
forth
an
arm
finding
no
mass
of
worshippers
through
whom
it
might
express
itself
completely
it
pressed
inanimate
matter
thus
into
its
service
here
was
the
beginning
the
woman
had
spoken
of
little
opening
clue
entire
reconstruction
lay
perhaps
beyond
and
henriot
next
realised
that
these
magnitudes
in
which
this
sought
to
clothe
itself
as
visible
form
were
curiously
familiar
it
was
not
a
new
thing
that
he
would
see
booming
softly
as
they
dropped
downwards
through
the
sky
with
a
motion
the
size
of
them
rendered
delusive
they
trooped
up
the
avenue
towards
the
central
point
that
summoned
them
he
realised
the
giant
flock
of
them
descent
of
fearful
beauty
outlining
a
type
of
life
denied
to
the
world
for
ages
countless
as
this
sand
that
blew
against
his
skin
careering
over
the
waste
of
desert
moved
the
army
of
dark
splendours
that
dwarfed
any
organic
structure
called
a
body
men
have
ever
known
he
recognised
them
cold
in
him
of
death
though
the
outlines
reared
higher
than
the
pyramids
and
towered
up
to
hide
whole
groups
of
stars
yes
he
recognised
them
in
their
partial
revelation
though
he
never
saw
the
monstrous
host
complete
but
one
of
them
he
realised
posing
its
eternal
riddle
to
the
sands
had
of
old
been
glimpsed
sufficiently
to
seize
its
form
in
stone
yet
poorly
seized
as
a
doll
may
stand
for
the
dignity
of
a
human
being
or
a
child
toy
represent
an
engine
that
draws
trains
and
he
knelt
there
on
his
narrow
ledge
the
world
of
men
forgotten
the
power
that
caught
him
was
too
great
a
thing
for
wonder
or
for
fear
he
even
felt
no
awe
sensation
of
any
kind
that
can
be
named
or
realised
left
him
utterly
he
forgot
himself
he
merely
watched
the
glory
numbed
him
block
and
pencil
as
the
reason
of
his
presence
there
at
all
no
longer
existed
yet
one
small
link
remained
that
held
him
to
some
kind
of
consciousness
of
earthly
things
he
never
lost
sight
of
this
that
being
just
outside
the
circle
of
evocation
he
was
safe
and
that
the
man
and
woman
being
stationary
in
its
untouched
centre
were
also
safe
but
that
a
movement
of
six
inches
in
any
direction
meant
for
any
one
of
them
instant
death
what
was
it
then
that
suddenly
strengthened
this
solitary
link
so
that
the
chain
tautened
and
he
felt
the
pull
of
it
henriot
could
not
say
he
came
back
with
the
rush
of
a
descending
drop
to
the
realisation
dimly
vaguely
as
from
great
distance
that
he
was
with
these
two
now
at
this
moment
in
the
wadi
hof
and
that
the
cold
of
dawn
was
in
the
air
about
him
the
chill
breath
of
the
desert
made
him
shiver
but
at
first
so
deeply
had
his
soul
been
dipped
in
this
fragment
of
ancient
worship
he
could
remember
nothing
more
somewhere
lay
a
little
spot
of
streets
and
houses
its
name
escaped
him
he
had
once
been
there
there
were
many
people
but
insignificant
people
who
were
they
and
what
had
he
to
do
with
them
all
recent
memories
had
been
drowned
in
the
tide
that
flooded
him
from
an
immeasurable
past
and
who
were
they
these
two
beings
standing
on
the
white
floor
of
sand
below
him
for
a
long
time
he
could
not
recover
their
names
yet
he
remembered
them
and
thus
robbed
of
association
that
names
bring
he
saw
them
for
an
instant
naked
and
knew
that
one
of
them
was
evil
one
of
them
was
vile
blackness
touched
the
picture
there
the
man
his
name
still
out
of
reach
was
sinister
impure
and
dark
at
the
heart
and
for
this
reason
the
evocation
had
been
partial
only
the
admixture
of
an
evil
motive
was
the
flaw
that
marred
complete
success
the
names
then
flashed
upon
him
lady
statham
richard
vance
vance
with
a
horrid
drop
from
splendour
into
something
mean
and
sordid
henriot
felt
the
pain
of
it
the
motive
of
the
man
was
so
insignificant
his
purpose
so
atrocious
more
and
more
with
the
name
came
back
his
first
repugnance
fear
suspicion
and
human
terror
caught
him
he
shrieked
but
as
in
nightmare
no
sound
escaped
his
lips
he
tried
to
move
a
wild
desire
to
interfere
to
protect
to
prevent
flung
him
forward
close
to
the
dizzy
edge
of
the
gulf
below
but
his
muscles
refused
obedience
to
the
will
the
paralysis
of
common
fear
rooted
him
to
the
rocks
but
the
sudden
change
of
focus
instantly
destroyed
the
picture
and
so
vehement
was
the
fall
from
glory
into
meanness
that
it
dislocated
the
machinery
of
clairvoyant
vision
the
inner
perception
clouded
and
grew
dark
outer
and
inner
mingled
in
violent
inextricable
confusion
the
wrench
seemed
almost
physical
it
happened
all
at
once
retreat
and
continuation
for
a
moment
somehow
combined
and
if
he
did
not
definitely
see
the
awful
thing
at
least
he
was
aware
that
it
had
come
to
pass
he
knew
it
as
positively
as
though
his
eye
were
glued
against
a
magnifying
lens
in
the
stillness
of
some
laboratory
he
witnessed
it
the
supreme
moment
of
evocation
was
close
life
through
that
awful
sandy
vortex
whirled
and
raged
loose
particles
showered
and
pelted
caught
by
the
draught
of
vehement
life
that
moulded
the
substance
of
the
desert
into
imperial
outline
when
suddenly
shot
the
little
evil
thing
across
that
marred
and
blasted
it
into
the
whirlpool
flew
forward
a
particle
of
material
that
was
a
human
being
and
the
caught
and
used
it
the
actual
accomplishment
henriot
did
not
claim
to
see
he
was
a
witness
but
a
witness
who
could
give
no
evidence
whether
the
woman
was
pushed
of
set
intention
or
whether
some
detail
of
sound
and
pattern
was
falsely
used
to
effect
the
terrible
result
he
was
helpless
to
determine
he
pretends
no
itemised
account
she
went
in
one
second
with
appalling
swiftness
she
disappeared
swallowed
out
of
space
and
time
within
that
awful
maw
one
little
corpuscle
among
a
million
through
which
the
life
now
stalking
the
desert
wastes
moulded
itself
a
body
sand
took
her
there
followed
emptiness
a
hush
of
unutterable
silence
stillness
peace
movement
and
sound
instantly
retired
whence
they
came
the
avenues
of
memory
closed
the
splendours
all
went
down
into
their
sandy
tombs
the
moon
had
sunk
into
the
libyan
wilderness
the
eastern
sky
was
red
the
dawn
drew
out
that
wondrous
sweetness
of
the
desert
which
is
as
sister
to
the
sweetness
that
the
moonlight
brings
the
desert
settled
back
to
sleep
huge
unfathomable
charged
to
the
brim
with
life
that
