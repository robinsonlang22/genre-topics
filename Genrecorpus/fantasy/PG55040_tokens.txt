preface
to
any
i
have
reason
to
believe
that
alice
s
adventures

wonderland
has
been
read
by
some
hundreds
of
english
children
aged
from
five
to
fifteen
also
by
children
aged
from
fifteen
to
yet
again
by
children
aged
from
to
and
even
by
children
for
there
such
children
in
whom
no
waning
of
health
and
strength
no
weariness
of
the
solemn
mockery
and
the
gaudy
glitter
and
the
hopeless
misery
of
life
has
availed
to
parch
the
pure
fountain
of
joy
that
wells
up
in
all
hearts
children
of
a
certain
age
whose
tale
of
years
must
be
left
untold
and
buried
in
respectful
silence
and
my
ambition
is
is
it
a
vain
one
to
be
read
by
children
aged
from
nought
to
five
to
be
read
nay
not
so
say
rather
to
be
thumbed
to
be
cooed
over
to
be
dogs
to
be
rumpled
to
be
kissed
by
the
illiterate
ungrammatical
dimpled
darlings
that
fill
your
nursery
with
merry
uproar
and
your
inmost
heart
of
hearts
with
a
restful
gladness
such
for
instance
as
a
child
i
once
knew
who
having
been
carefully
instructed
that
of
any
earthly
thing
was
enough
for
any
little
girl
and
that
to
ask
for
buns
oranges
of
anything
would
certainly
bring
upon
her
the
awful
charge
of
being
greedy
was
found
one
morning
sitting
up
in
bed
solemnly
regarding
her
little
naked
feet

the
white
rabbit
once
upon
a
time
there
was
a
little
girl
called
alice
and
she
had
a
very
curious
dream
would
you
like
to
hear
what
it
was
that
she
dreamed
about
well
this
was
the
thing
that
happened
a
white
rabbit
came
running
by
in
a
great
hurry
and
just
as
it
passed
alice
it
stopped
and
took
its
watch
out
of
its
pocket
wasn
t
a
funny
thing
did
ever
see
a
rabbit
that
had
a
watch
and
a
pocket
to
put
it
in
of
course
when
a
rabbit
has
a
watch
it
have
a
pocket
to
put
it
in
it
would
never
do
to
carry
it
about
in
its
mouth
and
it
wants
its
hands
sometimes
to
run
about
with
hasn
t
it
got
pretty
pink
eyes
i
think
white
rabbits
have
pink
eyes
and
pink
ears
and
a
nice
brown
coat
and
you
can
just
see
its
red
peeping
out
of
its
and
what
with
its
blue
and
its
yellow
waistcoat
it
really
is
nicely
dressed
oh
dear
oh
dear
said
the
rabbit
i
shall
be
too
late
would
it
be
too
late
i
wonder
well
you
see
it
had
to
go
and
visit
the
duchess
you
ll
see
a
picture
of
the
duchess
soon
sitting
in
her
kitchen
and
the
duchess
was
a
very
cross
old
lady
and
the
rabbit
she
d
be
very
angry
indeed
if
he
kept
her
waiting
so
the
poor
thing
was
as
frightened
as
frightened
could
be
don
t
you
see
how
he
s
trembling
just
shake
the
book
a
little
from
side
to
side
and
you
ll
soon
see
him
tremble
because
he
thought
the
duchess
would
have
his
head
cut
off
for
a
punishment
that
was
what
the
queen
of
hearts
used
to
do
when
was
angry
with
people
you
ll
see
a
picture
of
soon
at
least
she
used
to
their
heads
to
be
cut
off
and
she
always
it
was
done
though
they
never
did
it
and
so
when
the
white
rabbit
ran
away
alice
wanted
to
see
what
would
happen
to
it
so
she
ran
after
it
and
she
ran
and
she
ran
till
she
tumbled
right
down
the
and
then
she
had
a
very
long
fall
indeed
down
and
down
and
down
till
she
began
to
wonder
if
she
was
going
right
the
world
so
as
to
come
out
on
the
other
side
it
was
just
like
a
very
deep
well
only
there
was
no
water
in
it
if
anybody
had
such
a
fall
as
that
it
would
kill
them
most
likely
but
you
know
it
doesn
t
hurt
a
bit
to
fall
in
a
because
all
the
time
you
you
re
falling
you
really
lying
somewhere
safe
and
sound
and
fast
asleep
however
this
terrible
fall
came
to
an
end
at
last
and
down
came
alice
on
a
heap
of
sticks
and
dry
leaves
but
she
wasn
t
a
bit
hurt
and
up
she
jumped
and
ran
after
the
rabbit
again
and
so
that
was
the
beginning
of
alice
s
curious
dream
and
next
time
you
see
a
white
rabbit
try
and
fancy
going
to
have
a
curious
dream
just
like
dear
little
alice
illustration
ii
how
alice
grew
tall
and
so
after
alice
had
tumbled
down
the
and
had
run
a
long
long
way
underground
all
of
a
sudden
she
found
herself
in
a
great
hall
with
doors
all
round
it
but
all
the
doors
were
locked
so
you
see
poor
alice
couldn
t
get
out
of
the
hall
and
that
made
her
very
sad
however
after
a
little
while
she
came
to
a
little
table
all
made
of
glass
with
three
legs
there
are
of
the
legs
in
the
picture
and
just
the
of
the
other
leg
do
you
see
and
on
the
table
was
a
little
key
and
she
went
round
the
hall
and
tried
if
she
could
unlock
any
of
the
doors
with
it
poor
alice
the
key
wouldn
t
unlock
of
the
doors
but
at
last
she
came
upon
a
tiny
little
door
and
oh
how
glad
she
was
when
she
found
the
key
would
fit
it
so
she
unlocked
the
tiny
little
door
and
she
stooped
down
and
looked
through
it
and
what
do
you
think
she
saw
oh
such
a
beautiful
garden
and
she
did
so
to
go
into
it
but
the
door
was
too
small
she
couldn
t
squeeze
herself
through
any
more
than
could
squeeze
yourself
into
a
so
poor
little
alice
locked
up
the
door
and
took
the
key
back
to
the
table
again
and
time
she
found
quite
a
new
thing
on
it
now
look
at
the
picture
again
and
what
do
you
think
it
was
it
was
a
little
bottle
with
a
label
tied
to
it
with
the
words
drink
me
on
the
label
so
she
tasted
it
and
it
was
nice
so
she
set
to
work
and
drank
it
up
and
then
a
curious
thing
happened
to
her
you
ll
never
guess
what
it
was
so
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
she
got
smaller
and
smaller
till
at
last
she
was
just
the
size
of
a
little
doll
then
she
said
to
herself
i
m
the
right
size
to
get
through
the
little
door
and
away
she
ran
but
when
she
got
there
the
door
was
locked
and
the
key
was
on
the
top
of
the
table
and
she
couldn
t
reach
it
it
a
pity
she
had
locked
up
the
door
again
well
the
next
thing
she
found
was
a
little
cake
and
it
had
the
words
eat
me
marked
on
it
so
of
course
she
set
to
work
and
ate
it
up
and
what
do
you
think
happened
to
her
no
you
ll
never
guess
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
again
she
grew
and
she
grew
and
she
grew
taller
than
she
was
before
taller
than
child
taller
than
any
person
taller
and
taller
and
taller
just
look
at
the
picture
and
you
ll
how
tall
she
got
illustration
which
would
have
liked
the
best
do
you
think
to
be
a
little
tiny
alice
no
larger
than
a
kitten
or
a
great
tall
alice
with
your
head
always
knocking
against
the
ceiling
iii
the
pool
of
tears
perhaps
you
think
alice
must
have
been
very
much
pleased
when
she
had
eaten
the
little
cake
to
find
herself
growing
so
tremendously
tall
because
of
course
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
reach
the
little
key
off
the
glass
table
and
to
open
the
little
tiny
door
well
of
course
she
could
do
but
what
good
was
it
to
get
the
door
open
when
she
couldn
t
get
she
was
worse
off
than
ever
poor
thing
she
could
just
manage
by
putting
her
head
down
close
to
the
ground
to
through
with
one
eye
but
that
was
she
could
do
no
wonder
the
poor
tall
child
sat
down
and
cried
as
if
her
heart
would
break
so
she
cried
and
she
cried
and
her
tears
ran
down
the
middle
of
the
hall
like
a
deep
river
and
very
soon
there
was
quite
a
large
pool
of
tears
reaching
down
the
hall
and
there
she
might
have
staid
till
this
very
day
if
the
white
rabbit
hadn
t
happened
to
come
through
the
hall
on
his
way
to
visit
the
duchess
he
was
dressed
up
as
grand
as
grand
could
be
and
he
had
a
pair
of
white
kid
gloves
in
one
hand
and
a
little
fan
in
the
other
hand
and
he
kept
on
muttering
to
himself
oh
the
duchess
the
duchess
oh
she
be
savage
if
i
ve
kept
her
waiting
but
he
didn
t
see
alice
you
know
so
when
she
began
to
say
if
you
please
sir
her
voice
seemed
to
come
from
the
top
of
the
hall
because
her
head
was
so
high
up
and
the
rabbit
was
dreadfully
frightened
and
he
dropped
the
gloves
and
the
fan
and
ran
away
as
hard
as
he
could
go
then
a
curious
thing
indeed
happened
alice
took
up
the
fan
and
began
to
fan
herself
with
it
and
lo
and
behold
she
got
quite
small
again
and
all
in
a
minute
she
was
just
about
the
size
of
a
mouse
illustration
now
look
at
the
picture
and
you
ll
soon
guess
what
happened
next
it
looks
just
like
the
sea
doesn
t
it
but
it
is
the
pool
of
tears
all
made
of
tears
you
know
and
alice
has
tumbled
into
the
pool
and
the
mouse
has
tumbled
in
and
there
they
are
swimming
about
together
doesn
t
alice
look
pretty
as
she
swims
across
the
picture
you
can
just
see
her
blue
stockings
far
away
under
the
water
but
why
is
the
mouse
swimming
away
from
alice
in
such
a
hurry
well
the
reason
is
that
alice
began
talking
about
cats
and
dogs
and
a
mouse
always
talking
about
cats
and
dogs
suppose
were
swimming
about
in
a
pool
of
your
own
tears
and
suppose
somebody
began
talking
to
about
and
bottles
of
medicine
wouldn
t
swim
away
as
hard
as
you
could
go
iv
the
when
alice
and
the
mouse
had
got
out
of
the
pool
of
tears
of
course
they
were
very
wet
and
so
were
a
lot
of
other
curious
creatures
that
had
tumbled
in
as
well
there
was
a
dodo
that
s
the
great
bird
in
front
leaning
on
a
and
a
duck
and
a
lory
that
s
just
behind
the
duck
looking
over
its
head
and
an
eaglet
that
s
on
the
side
of
the
lory
and
several
others
well
and
so
they
didn
t
know
how
in
the
world
they
were
to
get
dry
again
but
the
dodo
who
was
a
very
wise
bird
told
them
the
right
way
was
to
have
a
and
what
do
you
think
was
don
t
know
well
you
an
ignorant
child
now
be
very
attentive
and
i
ll
soon
cure
you
of
your
ignorance
first
you
must
have
a
it
ought
to
be
a
of
circle
but
it
doesn
t
much
matter
shape
it
is
so
long
as
it
goes
a
good
way
round
and
joins
on
to
itself
again
then
you
must
put
all
the
on
the
course
here
and
there
it
doesn
t
matter
so
long
as
you
don
t
crowd
them
too
much
together
then
you
needn
t
say
one
two
three
and
away
but
let
them
all
set
off
running
just
when
they
like
and
leave
off
just
when
they
like
so
all
these
creatures
alice
and
all
went
on
running
round
and
round
till
they
were
all
quite
dry
again
and
then
the
dodo
said
had
won
and
must
have
prizes
of
course
had
to
give
them
their
prizes
and
she
had
nothing
to
give
them
but
a
few
comfits
she
happened
to
have
in
her
pocket
and
there
was
just
one
all
round
and
there
was
no
prize
for
alice
so
what
do
you
think
they
did
alice
had
nothing
left
but
her
thimble
now
look
at
the
picture
and
you
ll
see
what
happened
illustration
hand
it
over
here
said
the
dodo
then
the
dodo
took
the
thimble
and
handed
it
back
to
alice
and
said
we
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
elegant
thimble
and
then
all
the
other
creatures
cheered
wasn
t
a
curious
sort
of
present
to
give
her
suppose
they
wanted
to
give
a
would
you
rather
they
should
go
to
your
and
pick
out
your
nicest
doll
and
say
here
my
love
here
s
a
lovely
for
you
or
would
you
like
them
to
give
you
something
something
that
belong
to
you
before
bill
the
lizard
now
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
alice
s
adventures
in
the
white
rabbit
s
house
do
you
remember
how
the
rabbit
dropped
his
gloves
and
his
fan
when
he
was
so
frightened
at
hearing
alice
s
voice
that
seemed
to
come
down
from
the
sky
well
of
course
he
couldn
t
go
to
visit
the
duchess
his
gloves
and
his
fan
so
after
a
bit
he
came
back
again
to
look
for
them
by
this
time
the
dodo
and
all
the
other
curious
creatures
had
gone
away
and
alice
was
wandering
about
all
alone
so
what
do
you
think
he
did
actually
he
thought
she
was
his
housemaid
and
began
ordering
her
about
mary
ann
he
said
go
home
this
very
minute
and
fetch
me
a
pair
of
gloves
and
a
fan
quick
now
perhaps
he
couldn
t
see
very
clearly
with
his
pink
eyes
for
i
m
sure
alice
doesn
t
look
very
a
housemaid
she
however
she
was
a
very
little
girl
so
she
wasn
t
a
bit
offended
but
ran
off
to
the
rabbit
s
house
as
quick
as
she
could
it
was
lucky
she
found
the
door
open
for
if
she
had
had
to
ring
i
suppose
the
mary
ann
would
have
come
to
open
the
door
and
she
would
have
let
alice
come
in
and
i
m
sure
it
was
lucky
she
didn
t
meet
the
real
mary
ann
as
she
trotted
upstairs
for
i
m
afraid
she
would
have
taken
alice
for
a
robber
so
at
last
she
found
her
way
into
the
rabbit
s
room
and
there
was
a
pair
of
gloves
lying
on
the
table
and
she
was
just
going
to
take
them
up
and
go
away
when
she
happened
to
see
a
little
bottle
on
the
table
and
of
course
it
had
the
words
drink
me
on
the
label
and
of
course
alice
drank
some
well
i
think
that
was
lucky
too
don
t
for
if
she
drunk
any
all
this
wonderful
adventure
that
i
m
going
to
tell
you
about
wouldn
t
have
happened
at
all
and
wouldn
t
have
been
a
pity
you
re
getting
so
used
to
alice
s
adventures
that
i
daresay
you
can
guess
what
happened
next
if
you
can
t
i
ll
tell
you
she
grew
and
she
grew
and
she
grew
and
in
a
very
short
time
the
room
was
full
of
just
in
the
same
way
as
a
jar
is
full
of
jam
there
was
all
the
way
up
to
the
ceiling
and
in
every
corner
of
the
room
illustration
the
door
opened
inwards
so
of
course
there
wasn
t
any
room
to
open
it
so
when
the
rabbit
got
tired
of
waiting
and
came
to
fetch
his
gloves
for
himself
of
course
he
couldn
t
get
in
so
what
do
you
think
he
did
now
we
come
to
the
picture
he
sent
bill
the
lizard
up
to
the
roof
of
the
house
and
told
him
to
get
down
the
chimney
but
alice
happened
to
have
one
of
her
feet
in
the
so
when
she
heard
bill
coming
down
the
chimney
she
just
gave
a
little
tiny
kick
and
away
went
bill
flying
up
into
the
sky
poor
little
bill
don
t
you
pity
him
very
much
how
frightened
he
must
have
been
vi
the
dear
little
puppy
well
it
doesn
t
look
such
a
very
puppy
does
it
but
then
you
see
alice
had
grown
very
small
indeed
and
what
makes
the
puppy
look
so
large
when
alice
had
eaten
one
of
those
little
magic
cakes
that
she
found
in
the
white
rabbit
s
house
it
made
her
get
quite
small
directly
so
that
she
could
get
through
the
door
or
else
she
could
have
got
out
of
the
house
again
wouldn
t
have
been
a
pity
because
then
she
wouldn
t
have
dreamed
all
the
other
curious
things
that
we
re
going
to
read
about
so
it
really
a
puppy
you
see
and
isn
t
it
a
little
and
look
at
the
way
it
s
barking
at
the
little
stick
that
alice
is
holding
out
for
it
you
can
see
she
was
a
afraid
of
it
all
the
time
because
she
s
got
behind
that
great
thistle
for
fear
it
should
run
over
her
that
would
have
been
just
about
as
bad
for
as
it
would
be
for
to
be
run
over
by
a
waggon
and
four
horses
have
you
got
a
little
pet
puppy
at
home
if
you
have
i
hope
you
re
always
kind
to
it
and
give
it
nice
things
to
eat
once
upon
a
time
i
knew
some
little
children
about
as
big
as
you
and
they
had
a
little
pet
dog
of
their
own
and
it
was
called
and
this
is
what
they
told
me
about
its
do
you
know
one
day
we
remembered
it
was
dash
s
birthday
that
day
so
we
said
let
s
give
dash
a
nice
like
what
we
have
on
birthdays
so
we
thought
and
we
thought
now
what
is
it
like
best
of
all
on
birthdays
and
we
thought
and
we
thought
and
at
last
we
all
called
out
together
why
its
of
course
so
of
course
we
thought
dash
would
be
sure
to
like
it
very
much
too
illustration
so
we
went
to
the
cook
and
we
got
her
to
make
a
saucerful
of
nice
and
then
we
called
dash
into
the
house
and
we
said
now
dash
you
re
going
to
have
your
we
expected
dash
would
jump
for
joy
but
it
didn
t
one
bit
so
we
put
the
saucer
down
before
it
and
we
said
now
dash
don
t
be
greedy
eat
it
nicely
like
a
good
dog
so
dash
just
tasted
it
with
the
tip
of
its
tongue
and
then
it
made
oh
such
a
horrid
face
and
then
do
you
know
it
did
it
so
it
wouldn
t
eat
a
bit
more
of
it
so
we
had
to
put
it
all
down
its
throat
with
a
spoon
i
wonder
if
alice
will
give
little
puppy
some
porridge
i
don
t
think
she
because
she
hasn
t
got
any
with
her
i
can
t
see
any
saucer
in
the
picture
vii
the
blue
caterpillar
would
you
like
to
know
what
happened
to
alice
after
she
had
got
away
from
the
puppy
it
was
far
too
large
an
animal
you
know
for
to
play
with
i
don
t
suppose
would
much
enjoy
playing
with
a
young
hippopotamus
would
you
you
would
always
be
expecting
to
be
crushed
as
flat
as
a
pancake
under
its
great
heavy
feet
so
alice
was
very
glad
to
run
away
while
it
wasn
t
looking
well
she
wandered
up
and
down
and
didn
t
know
what
in
the
world
to
do
to
make
herself
grow
up
to
her
right
size
again
of
course
she
knew
that
she
had
to
eat
or
drink
that
was
the
regular
rule
you
know
but
she
couldn
t
guess
thing
illustration
however
she
soon
came
to
a
great
mushroom
that
was
so
tall
that
she
couldn
t
see
over
the
top
of
it
without
standing
on
and
what
do
you
think
she
saw
something
that
i
m
sure
never
talked
to
in
all
your
life
it
was
a
large
blue
caterpillar
i
ll
tell
you
soon
what
alice
and
the
caterpillar
talked
about
but
first
let
us
have
a
good
look
at
the
picture
that
curious
thing
standing
in
front
of
the
caterpillar
is
called
a
hookah
and
it
s
used
for
smoking
the
smoke
comes
through
that
long
tube
that
winds
round
and
round
like
a
serpent
and
do
you
see
its
long
nose
and
chin
at
least
they
exactly
like
a
nose
and
chin
don
t
they
but
they
really
two
of
its
legs
you
know
a
caterpillar
has
got
of
legs
you
can
see
some
more
of
them
further
down
what
a
bother
it
must
be
to
a
caterpillar
counting
over
such
a
lot
of
legs
every
night
to
make
sure
it
hasn
t
lost
any
of
them
and
great
bother
must
be
having
to
settle
leg
it
had
better
move
first
i
think
if
had
forty
or
fifty
legs
and
if
you
wanted
to
go
a
walk
you
d
be
such
a
time
in
settling
which
leg
to
begin
with
that
you
d
never
go
a
walk
at
all
and
what
did
alice
and
the
caterpillar
about
i
wonder
well
alice
told
it
how
confusing
it
was
being
first
one
size
and
then
another
and
the
caterpillar
asked
her
if
she
liked
the
size
she
was
just
then
and
alice
said
she
would
like
to
be
just
a
bit
larger
three
inches
was
such
a
height
to
be
just
mark
off
three
inches
on
the
wall
about
the
length
of
your
middle
finger
and
you
ll
see
what
size
she
was
and
the
caterpillar
told
her
one
side
of
the
mushroom
would
make
her
grow
and
the
other
side
would
make
her
grow
so
alice
took
two
little
bits
of
it
with
her
to
nibble
and
managed
to
make
herself
quite
a
nice
comfortable
height
before
she
went
on
to
visit
the
duchess
illustration
viii
the
would
you
like
to
hear
about
alice
s
visit
to
the
duchess
it
was
a
very
interesting
visit
indeed
i
can
assure
you
of
course
she
knocked
at
the
door
to
begin
with
but
nobody
came
so
she
had
to
open
it
for
herself
now
if
you
look
at
the
picture
you
ll
see
exactly
what
alice
saw
when
she
got
inside
the
door
led
right
into
the
kitchen
you
see
the
duchess
sat
in
the
middle
of
the
room
nursing
the
baby
the
baby
was
howling
the
soup
was
boiling
the
cook
was
stirring
the
soup
the
cat
it
was
a
cat
was
grinning
as
cheshire
cats
always
do
all
these
things
were
happening
just
as
alice
went
in
the
duchess
has
a
beautiful
cap
and
gown
hasn
t
she
but
i
m
afraid
she
got
a
very
beautiful
the
baby
well
i
daresay
you
ve
seen
nicer
babies
than
and
more
ones
too
however
take
a
good
look
at
it
and
we
ll
see
if
you
know
it
again
next
time
you
meet
it
the
cook
well
you
have
seen
nicer
cooks
once
or
twice
but
i
m
nearly
sure
you
ve
seen
a
nicer
now
you
and
you
like
to
have
a
cat
of
your
own
just
like
that
one
with
lovely
green
eyes
and
smiling
so
sweetly
the
duchess
was
very
rude
to
alice
and
no
wonder
why
she
even
called
her
own
pig
and
it
a
pig
it
and
she
ordered
the
cook
to
chop
off
alice
s
head
though
of
course
the
cook
didn
t
do
it
and
at
last
she
threw
the
baby
at
her
so
alice
caught
the
baby
and
took
it
away
with
her
and
i
think
that
was
about
the
best
thing
she
could
do
so
she
wandered
away
through
the
wood
carrying
the
ugly
little
thing
with
her
and
a
great
job
it
was
to
keep
hold
of
it
it
wriggled
about
so
but
at
last
she
found
out
that
the
way
was
to
keep
tight
hold
of
its
left
foot
and
its
right
ear
but
don
t
try
to
hold
on
to
a
baby
like
that
my
child
there
are
not
many
babies
that
being
nursed
in
way
well
and
so
the
baby
kept
grunting
and
grunting
so
that
alice
had
to
say
to
it
quite
seriously
if
you
re
going
to
turn
into
a
my
dear
i
ll
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
mind
now
and
at
last
she
looked
down
into
its
face
and
what
you
think
had
happened
to
it
look
at
the
picture
and
see
if
you
can
guess
illustration
why
not
the
baby
that
alice
was
nursing
is
it
ah
i
you
wouldn
t
know
it
again
though
i
told
you
to
take
a
good
look
at
it
yes
it
the
baby
and
it
s
turned
into
a
little
so
alice
put
it
down
and
let
it
trot
away
into
the
wood
and
she
said
to
herself
it
was
a
ugly
but
it
makes
rather
a
handsome
i
don
t
you
think
she
was
right
ix
the
all
alone
all
alone
poor
alice
no
baby
not
even
a
to
keep
her
company
so
you
may
be
sure
she
was
very
glad
indeed
when
she
saw
the
perched
up
in
a
tree
over
her
head
the
cat
has
a
very
nice
smile
no
doubt
but
just
look
what
a
lot
of
teeth
it
s
got
isn
t
alice
just
a
shy
of
it
well
yes
a
but
then
it
couldn
t
help
having
teeth
you
know
and
it
have
helped
smiling
supposing
it
had
been
cross
so
on
the
whole
she
was
doesn
t
alice
look
very
prim
holding
her
head
so
straight
up
and
with
her
hands
behind
her
just
as
if
she
were
going
to
say
her
lessons
to
the
cat
illustration
and
that
reminds
me
there
s
a
little
lesson
i
want
to
teach
while
we
re
looking
at
this
picture
of
alice
and
the
cat
now
don
t
be
in
a
bad
temper
about
it
my
dear
child
it
s
a
very
lesson
indeed
do
you
see
that
growing
close
to
the
tree
and
do
you
know
why
it
s
called
a
perhaps
you
think
it
s
got
something
to
do
with
a
fox
no
indeed
never
wear
gloves
the
right
word
is
did
you
ever
hear
that
fairies
used
to
be
called
the
good
now
we
ve
finished
the
lesson
and
we
ll
wait
a
minute
till
you
ve
got
your
temper
again
well
do
you
feel
quite
again
no
no
crossness
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
then
we
ll
go
on
cheshire
puss
said
alice
that
a
pretty
name
for
a
cat
would
you
tell
me
which
way
i
ought
to
go
from
here
and
so
the
told
her
which
way
she
ought
to
go
if
she
wanted
to
visit
the
hatter
and
which
way
to
go
to
visit
the
march
hare
they
re
both
mad
said
the
cat
and
then
the
cat
vanished
away
just
like
the
flame
of
a
candle
when
it
goes
out
so
alice
set
off
to
visit
the
march
hare
and
as
she
went
along
there
was
the
cat
again
and
she
told
it
she
didn
t
it
coming
and
going
so
quickly
illustration
so
this
time
the
cat
vanished
quite
slowly
beginning
with
the
tail
and
ending
with
the
grin
wasn
t
a
curious
thing
a
grin
without
any
cat
would
you
like
to
see
one
if
you
turn
up
the
corner
of
this
leaf
you
ll
have
alice
looking
at
the
grin
and
she
doesn
t
look
a
bit
more
frightened
than
when
she
was
looking
at
the
cat
she
x
the
mad
this
is
the
mad
you
see
alice
had
left
the
and
had
gone
off
to
see
the
march
hare
and
the
hatter
as
the
had
advised
her
and
she
found
them
having
tea
under
a
great
tree
with
a
dormouse
sitting
between
them
there
were
only
those
three
at
the
table
but
there
were
quantities
of
set
all
along
it
you
ca
n
t
see
all
the
table
you
know
and
even
in
the
bit
you
see
there
are
nine
cups
counting
the
one
the
march
hare
has
got
in
his
hand
that
s
the
march
hare
with
the
long
ears
and
straws
mixed
up
with
his
hair
the
straws
showed
he
was
mad
i
don
t
know
why
never
twist
up
straws
among
hair
for
fear
people
should
think
you
re
mad
there
was
a
nice
green
at
the
end
of
the
table
that
looked
as
if
it
was
just
meant
for
alice
so
she
went
and
sat
down
in
it
then
she
had
quite
a
long
talk
with
the
march
hare
and
the
hatter
the
dormouse
didn
t
say
much
you
see
it
was
fast
asleep
generally
and
it
only
just
woke
up
for
a
moment
now
and
then
as
long
as
it
was
asleep
it
was
very
useful
to
the
march
hare
and
the
hatter
because
it
had
a
nice
round
soft
head
just
like
a
pillow
so
they
could
put
their
elbows
on
it
and
lean
across
it
and
talk
to
each
other
quite
comfortably
you
wouldn
t
like
people
to
use
head
for
a
pillow
you
but
if
you
were
fast
asleep
like
the
dormouse
you
wouldn
t
feel
it
so
i
suppose
you
wouldn
t
care
about
it
illustration
i
m
afraid
they
gave
alice
little
to
eat
and
drink
however
after
a
bit
she
helped
herself
to
some
tea
and
only
i
don
t
quite
see
where
she
the
and
she
had
no
plate
for
it
nobody
seems
to
have
a
plate
except
the
hatter
i
believe
the
march
hare
must
have
had
one
as
well
because
when
they
all
moved
one
place
on
that
was
the
rule
at
this
curious
and
alice
had
to
go
into
the
place
of
the
march
hare
she
found
he
had
just
upset
the
into
his
plate
so
i
suppose
his
plate
and
the
are
hidden
behind
that
large
the
hatter
used
to
carry
about
hats
to
sell
and
even
the
one
that
he
s
got
on
his
head
is
meant
to
be
sold
you
see
it
s
got
its
price
marked
on
it
a
and
a
that
means
ten
shillings
and
wasn
t
that
a
funny
way
of
selling
hats
and
hasn
t
he
got
a
beautiful
on
such
a
lovely
yellow
tie
with
large
red
spots
he
has
just
got
up
to
say
to
alice
your
hair
wants
cutting
that
was
a
rude
thing
to
say
it
and
do
you
think
her
hair
want
cutting
think
it
s
a
very
pretty
length
just
the
right
length
xi
the
queen
s
garden
this
is
a
little
bit
of
the
beautiful
garden
i
told
you
about
you
see
alice
had
managed
at
last
to
get
quite
small
so
that
she
could
go
through
the
little
door
i
suppose
she
was
about
as
tall
as
a
mouse
if
it
stood
on
its
so
of
course
this
was
a
tiny
and
these
are
tiny
gardeners
illustration
what
funny
little
men
they
are
but
they
men
do
you
think
i
think
they
must
be
live
cards
with
just
a
head
and
arms
and
legs
so
as
to
like
little
men
and
what
they
doing
with
that
red
paint
i
wonder
well
you
see
this
is
what
they
told
alice
the
queen
of
hearts
wanted
to
have
a
just
in
that
corner
and
these
poor
little
gardeners
had
made
a
great
mistake
and
had
put
in
a
one
instead
and
they
were
so
frightened
about
it
because
the
queen
was
to
be
angry
and
then
she
would
order
all
their
heads
to
be
cut
off
she
was
a
dreadfully
savage
queen
and
that
was
the
way
she
always
did
when
she
was
angry
with
people
off
with
their
heads
they
didn
t
cut
their
heads
off
you
know
because
nobody
ever
obeyed
her
but
that
was
what
she
always
ca
n
t
you
guess
what
the
poor
little
gardeners
are
trying
to
do
they
re
trying
to
paint
the
roses
and
they
re
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
it
done
before
the
queen
comes
and
then
the
queen
won
t
find
out
it
was
a
to
begin
with
and
then
the
little
men
won
t
get
their
heads
cut
off
you
see
there
were
large
white
roses
on
the
tree
such
a
job
to
get
them
all
painted
red
but
they
ve
got
three
and
a
half
done
now
and
if
only
they
wouldn
t
stop
to
talk
work
away
little
men
work
away
or
the
queen
will
be
coming
before
it
s
done
and
if
she
finds
any
roses
on
the
tree
do
you
know
what
will
happen
it
will
be
off
with
their
heads
oh
work
away
my
little
men
hurry
hurry
illustration
queen
has
come
and
she
angry
oh
my
poor
little
alice
xii
the
did
you
ever
play
at
croquet
there
are
large
wooden
balls
painted
with
different
colours
that
you
have
to
roll
about
and
arches
of
wire
that
you
have
to
send
them
through
and
great
wooden
mallets
with
long
handles
to
knock
the
balls
about
with
now
look
at
the
picture
and
you
ll
see
that
has
just
been
playing
a
game
of
croquet
but
she
play
with
that
great
red
what
in
her
arms
why
how
could
she
hold
the
mallet
illustration
why
my
dear
child
that
great
red
what
its
name
is
the
mallet
in
this
the
balls
were
live
you
know
a
can
roll
itself
up
into
a
ball
and
the
mallets
were
live
so
alice
is
just
resting
from
the
game
for
a
minute
to
have
a
chat
with
that
dear
old
thing
the
duchess
and
of
course
she
keeps
her
mallet
under
her
arm
so
as
not
to
lose
it
but
i
don
t
think
she
a
dear
old
thing
one
bit
to
call
her
baby
a
and
to
want
to
chop
off
alice
s
head
oh
that
was
only
a
joke
about
chopping
off
alice
s
head
and
as
to
the
baby
why
it
a
pig
you
know
and
just
look
at
her
why
it
s
wider
than
all
alice
s
head
and
yet
you
can
only
see
half
of
it
well
they
d
only
had
a
little
chat
when
the
queen
came
and
took
alice
away
to
see
the
gryphon
and
the
mock
turtle
don
t
know
what
a
gryphon
is
well
do
you
know
that
s
the
question
however
look
at
the
picture
that
creature
with
a
red
head
and
red
claws
and
green
scales
is
the
now
you
know
and
the
other
s
the
it
s
got
a
calf
because
calf
s
head
is
used
to
make
turtle
now
you
know
but
what
are
they
going
round
and
round
alice
like
that
why
i
thought
of
you
d
know
they
re
dancing
illustration
and
next
time
meet
a
gryphon
and
a
mock
turtle
i
daresay
they
ll
dance
it
for
if
you
ask
them
prettily
only
don
t
let
them
come
close
or
they
ll
be
treading
on
your
toes
as
they
did
on
poor
alice
s
xiii
who
stole
the
tarts
did
you
ever
hear
how
the
queen
of
hearts
made
some
tarts
and
can
you
tell
me
what
became
of
them
why
of
i
can
doesn
t
the
song
tell
all
about
it
queen
of
hearts
she
made
some
tarts
all
on
a
summer
day
the
knave
of
hearts
he
stole
those
tarts
and
took
them
quite
away
well
yes
the
says
so
but
it
would
never
do
to
punish
the
poor
knave
just
because
there
was
a
about
him
they
had
to
take
him
prisoner
and
put
chains
on
his
wrists
and
bring
him
before
the
king
of
hearts
so
that
there
might
be
a
regular
trial
now
if
you
look
at
the
big
picture
at
the
beginning
of
this
book
you
ll
see
what
a
grand
thing
a
trial
is
when
the
judge
is
a
king
the
king
is
very
grand
he
but
he
doesn
t
look
very
i
think
that
big
crown
on
the
top
of
his
wig
must
be
heavy
and
uncomfortable
but
he
had
to
wear
them
you
see
so
that
people
might
know
he
was
a
judge
a
king
and
the
queen
look
cross
she
can
see
the
dish
of
tarts
on
the
table
that
she
had
taken
such
trouble
to
make
and
she
can
see
the
bad
knave
do
you
see
the
chains
hanging
from
his
wrists
that
stole
them
away
from
her
so
i
don
t
think
it
s
any
wonder
if
she
feel
a
cross
the
white
rabbit
is
standing
near
the
king
reading
out
the
song
to
tell
everybody
what
a
bad
knave
he
is
and
the
jury
you
can
just
see
two
of
them
up
in
the
the
frog
and
the
duck
have
to
settle
whether
he
s
guilty
or
not
now
i
ll
tell
you
about
the
accident
that
happened
to
alice
you
see
she
was
sitting
close
by
the
and
she
was
called
as
a
witness
you
know
what
a
witness
is
a
witness
is
a
person
who
has
seen
the
prisoner
do
whatever
he
s
accused
of
or
at
any
rate
knows
that
s
important
in
the
trial
but
hadn
t
seen
the
queen
the
tarts
and
she
hadn
t
seen
the
knave
the
tarts
and
in
fact
she
didn
t
know
anything
about
it
so
why
in
the
world
they
wanted
to
be
a
witness
i
m
sure
ca
n
t
tell
you
anyhow
they
want
her
and
the
white
rabbit
blew
his
big
trumpet
and
shouted
out
alice
and
so
alice
jumped
up
in
a
great
hurry
and
then
and
then
what
you
think
happened
why
her
skirt
caught
against
the
and
tipped
it
over
and
all
the
poor
little
jurors
came
tumbling
out
of
it
illustration
let
s
try
if
we
can
make
out
all
the
twelve
you
know
there
ought
to
be
twelve
to
make
up
a
jury
i
see
the
frog
and
the
dormouse
and
the
rat
and
the
ferret
and
the
hedgehog
and
the
lizard
and
the
and
the
mole
and
the
duck
and
the
squirrel
and
a
screaming
bird
with
a
long
beak
just
behind
the
mole
but
that
only
makes
eleven
we
must
find
one
more
creature
oh
do
you
see
a
little
white
head
coming
out
behind
the
mole
and
just
under
the
duck
s
beak
that
makes
up
the
twelve
tenniel
says
the
screaming
bird
is
a
of
course
you
know
what
is
and
the
little
white
head
is
a
isn
t
it
a
little
alice
picked
them
all
up
again
very
carefully
and
i
hope
they
weren
t
hurt
xiv
the
shower
of
cards
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
it
all
about
and
what
s
happening
to
alice
well
i
ll
tell
you
all
about
it
as
well
i
can
the
way
the
trial
ended
was
this
the
king
wanted
the
jury
to
settle
whether
the
knave
of
hearts
was
or
that
means
that
they
were
to
settle
whether
had
stolen
the
tarts
or
if
somebody
else
had
taken
them
but
the
wicked
wanted
to
have
his
settled
first
of
all
that
wasn
t
at
all
fair
it
because
you
know
supposing
he
never
the
tarts
then
of
course
he
oughtn
t
to
be
punished
would
like
to
be
punished
for
something
you
hadn
t
done
illustration
so
alice
said
stuff
and
nonsense
so
the
queen
said
off
with
her
head
just
what
she
always
said
when
she
was
angry
so
alice
said
who
cares
for
you
re
nothing
but
a
pack
of
cards
so
they
were
very
angry
and
flew
up
into
the
air
and
came
tumbling
down
again
all
over
alice
just
like
a
shower
of
rain
and
i
think
you
ll
guess
what
happened
next
the
next
thing
was
alice
woke
up
out
of
her
curious
dream
and
she
found
that
the
cards
were
only
some
leaves
off
the
tree
that
the
wind
had
blown
down
upon
her
face
it
be
a
nice
thing
to
have
a
curious
dream
just
like
alice
the
best
plan
is
this
first
lie
down
under
a
tree
and
wait
till
a
white
rabbit
runs
by
with
a
watch
in
his
hand
then
shut
your
eyes
and
pretend
to
be
dear
little
alice
alice
dear
the
end
an
easter
greeting
to
every
child
who
loves
my
dear
child
to
fancy
if
you
can
that
you
are
reading
a
real
letter
from
a
real
friend
whom
you
have
seen
and
whose
voice
you
can
seem
to
yourself
to
hear
wishing
you
as
i
do
now
with
all
my
heart
a
happy
you
know
that
delicious
dreamy
feeling
when
one
first
wakes
on
a
summer
morning
with
the
twitter
of
birds
in
the
air
and
the
fresh
breeze
coming
in
at
the
open
window
when
lying
lazily
with
eyes
half
shut
one
sees
as
in
a
dream
green
boughs
waving
or
waters
rippling
in
a
golden
light
it
is
a
pleasure
very
near
to
sadness
bringing
tears
to
one
s
eyes
like
a
beautiful
picture
or
poem
and
is
not
that
a
mother
s
gentle
hand
that
undraws
your
curtains
and
a
mother
s
sweet
voice
that
summons
you
to
rise
to
rise
and
forget
in
the
bright
sunlight
the
ugly
dreams
that
frightened
you
so
when
all
was
dark
to
rise
and
enjoy
another
happy
day
first
kneeling
to
thank
that
unseen
friend
who
sends
you
the
beautiful
sun
these
strange
words
from
a
writer
of
such
tales
as
alice
and
is
this
a
strange
letter
to
find
in
a
book
of
nonsense
it
may
be
so
some
perhaps
may
blame
me
for
thus
mixing
together
things
grave
and
gay
others
may
smile
and
think
it
odd
that
any
one
should
speak
of
solemn
things
at
all
except
in
church
and
on
a
sunday
but
i
think
nay
i
am
sure
that
some
children
will
read
this
gently
and
lovingly
and
in
the
spirit
in
which
i
have
written
i
do
not
believe
god
means
us
thus
to
divide
life
into
two
halves
to
wear
a
grave
face
on
sunday
and
to
think
it
to
even
so
much
as
mention
him
on
a
do
you
think
he
cares
to
see
only
kneeling
figures
and
to
hear
only
tones
of
prayer
and
that
he
does
not
also
love
to
see
the
lambs
leaping
in
the
sunlight
and
to
hear
the
merry
voices
of
the
children
as
they
roll
among
the
hay
surely
their
innocent
laughter
is
as
sweet
in
his
ears
as
the
grandest
anthem
that
ever
rolled
up
from
the
dim
religious
light
of
some
solemn
cathedral
if
i
have
written
anything
to
add
to
those
stores
of
innocent
and
healthy
amusement
that
are
laid
up
in
books
for
the
children
i
love
so
well
it
is
surely
something
i
may
hope
to
look
back
upon
without
shame
and
sorrow
as
how
much
of
life
must
then
be
recalled
when
my
turn
comes
to
walk
through
the
valley
of
easter
sun
will
rise
on
you
dear
child
feeling
your
life
in
every
limb
and
eager
to
rush
out
into
the
fresh
morning
air
and
many
an
will
come
and
go
before
it
finds
you
feeble
and
creeping
wearily
out
to
bask
once
more
in
the
sunlight
but
it
is
good
even
now
to
think
sometimes
of
that
great
morning
when
the
sun
of
righteousness
shall
arise
with
healing
in
his
your
gladness
need
not
be
the
less
for
the
thought
that
you
will
one
day
see
a
brighter
dawn
than
this
when
lovelier
sights
will
meet
your
eyes
than
any
waving
trees
or
rippling
waters
when
shall
undraw
your
curtains
and
sweeter
tones
than
ever
loving
mother
breathed
shall
wake
you
to
a
new
and
glorious
day
and
when
all
the
sadness
and
the
sin
that
darkened
life
on
this
little
earth
shall
be
forgotten
like
the
dreams
of
a
night
that
is
past
affectionate
christmas
greetings

fairy

a
lady
dear
if
fairies
may
for
a

lay
aside

tricks

we
have

on

as
comes

remember
it
again
echo
still

peace
on

lewis
carroll
having
been
requested
to
allow
an
easter
greeting
a
leaflet
addressed
to
children
first
published
in
and
frequently
given
with
his
books
to
be
sold
separately
has
arranged
with
harrison
of
pall
mall
who
will
supply
a
single
copy
for
or
for
or
for
cautions
to
readers
on
august
a
story
appeared
in
judy
s
no
entitled
the
land
of
idleness
by
lewis
this
story
was
really
written
by
a
lady
fräulein
ida
lackowitz
acting
on
her
behalf
carroll
forwarded
it
to
the
editor
and
this
led
to
the
mistake
of
naming
him
as
its
author
in
october
the
writer
of
an
article
on
literature
for
the
little
ones
in
nineteenth
stated
that
in
tom
hood
was
delighting
the
world
with
such
works
as
nowhere
to
the
north
between
tom
hood
and
lewis
carroll
there
is
more
than
a
suspicion
of
resemblance
in
some
particulars
s
adventures
in
narrowly
escapes
challenging
a
comparison
with
nowhere
to
the
north
the
idea
of
both
is
so
similar
that
carroll
can
hardly
have
been
surprised
if
some
people
have
believed
he
was
inspired
by
the
date
is
a
mistake
nowhere
