what
indeed
why
i
can
almost
hear
you
shout
two
oz
mysteries
and
here
you
have
them
in
this
newest
oz
story
two
very
mysterious
mysteries
to
solve
and
ponder
over
and
so
many
new
kingdoms
and
characters
i
can
hardly
remember
the
proper
spelling
for
their
will
be
glad
to
know
that
dorothy

most
of
the
strange
adventures
in
this
book
and
remember
pigasus
well
i
have
long
suspected
pigasus
could
be
useful
as
well
as
poetical
and
now
that
he
has
so
convincingly
proved
his
prowess
how
do
you
like
that
word
we
have
to
treat
him
with
more
respect

been
grand
and
if
i
had
the
magic
necklace
mentioned
in
this
story
i
would
wish
you
three
hundred
and
days
of
after
all
i
have
a

each
boy
or

the
king
of
skampavia
is
this
all
the
king
of
skampavia
frowned
at
the
great
stack
of
bags
bales
crates
and
carriers
heaped
around
his
throne
leaning
forward
he
gingerly
extracted
a
fig
from
one
of
the
baskets
and
popped
it
into
his
enormous
mouth
pah
dry
as
a
blotter
spluttered
the
ruler
gritting
his
teeth
with
disgust
and
look
at
those
cocoanuts
no
bigger
round
than
a
baby
rattle
leaping
off
his
throne
he
began
kicking
at
the
baskets
of
vegetables
and
bales
of
cotton
and
other
merchandise
what
dusty
junk
is
this
he
raged
glaring
furiously
at
pinny
penny
his
patient
prime
minister
how
dare
they
send
me
such
stuff
clasping
and
unclasping
his
hands
nervously
pinny
penny
nevertheless
spoke
up
boldly
because
they
have
nothing
better
your
majesty
what
can
our
poor
subjects
do
with
land
so
unprofitable
and
barren
then
not
only
must
they
produce
enough
for
their
own
needs
but
are
required
by
the
law
to
give
of
all
they
raise
to
the
crown
and
why
not
blustered
skamperoo
settling
back
argumentatively
on
his
throne
i
am
the
king
you
ca
get
around
that
you
know
no
sighed
pinny
penny
and
drawing
aside
one
of
the
shabby
curtains
he
looked
sorrowfully
out
into
the
courtyard
what
all
that
racket
demanded
his
master
as
a
medley
of
shouts
roars
and
dull
thuds
came
rolling
up
to
them
forgetting
his
anger
for
a
moment
he
bounded
to
his
feet
and
came
across
the
room
to
look
over
pinny
penny
shoulder
a
slight
argument
seems
to
have
arisen
among
the
supervisors
murmured
pinny
penny
resignedly
now
skampavia
i
must
tell
you
is
roughly
divided
into
seven
counties
and
over
each
county
skamperoo
had
set
a
supervisor
whose
duty
it
was
to
govern
the
province
and
to
turn
over
to
him
of
all
produce
and
merchandise
in
that
county
to
save
time
and
easily
identify
them
the
supervisors
were
known
by
the
size
of
the
counties
they
governed
for
instance
the
supervisor
of
the
first
county
which
was
one
mile
wide
and
ten
miles
long
was
called
onebyten
the
supervisor
of
the
second
county
twobyfour
and
the
others
were
variously
known
as
threebysix
ninebyfive
eightbyeight
fivebynine
and
fourbyseven
twice
a
year
the
supervisors
rode
into
the
capital
with
their
tribute
and
now
down
in
the
courtyard
the
seven
tremendous
skampavians
were
in
a
perfect
pitched
battle
helped
out
by
all
the
guards
and
palace
servants
argument
roared
the
king
slapping
pinny
penny
rudely
on
the
shoulder
it
a
fight
and
you
know
it
ho
ho
just
look
at
the
rascals
i
tell
you
old
two
pins
however
poorly
they
serve
us
as
farmers
and
merchants
our
skampavians
can
certainly
fight
and
who
says
i
too
hard
on
them
have
i
not
given
every
man
jack
a
dress
uniform
and
gun
and
made
them
learn
military
drilling
and
marching
at
the
royal
college
and
what
use
is
all
this
drilling
and
marching
inquired
pinny
penny
wearily
letting
the
curtain
fall
he
hurried
away
for
well
he
knew
if
he
did
not
put
a
stop
to
the
conflict
in
the
courtyard
every
window
in
the
palace
would
be
broken
now
what
did
he
mean
by
that
muttered
skamperoo
peevishly
as
his
little
prime
minister
whisked
out
of
sight
pursing
his
lips
he
seated
himself
heavily
on
his
throne
after
all
pinny
penny
had
only
spoken
the
truth
why
had
his
father
or
his
father
father
ever
picked
out
this
pesky
little
country
in
the
first
place
located
in
the
southern
part
of
the
desert
of
noland
between
the
kingdoms
of
ix
and
merryland
skampavia
he
was
forced
to
admit
had
neither
riches
beauty
nor
interest
his
castle
though
poor
and
shabby
was
comfortable
enough
and
having
lived
in
it
all
his
life
he
was
used
to
it
he
had
put
up
with
the
hot
dry
climate
and
the
poor
quality
of
the
food
but
after
all
why
should
he
continue
to
do
so
in
those
long
ago
days
in
the
school
room
he
had
studied
of
energetic
rulers
who
had
taken
their
armies
and
gone
forth
to
conquer
richer
and
more
desirable
lands
from
their
neighbors
well
then
why
should
not
he
take
his
men
push
over
the
border
into
a
more
fertile
and
kindly
land
the
idea
pleased
but
at
the
same
time
annoyed
him
skamperoo
was
fat
and
lazy
he
loved
quiet
and
ease
and
the
thought
of
a
hard
military
campaign
made
him
shudder
with
distaste
still
he
reflected
remembering
pinny
reproachful
face
a
king
should
do
something
for
his
subjects
and
the
more
he
did
for
them
ho
ho
the
more
he
could
make
them
do
for
him
a
rich
and
prosperous
country
meant
a
rich
and
prosperous
ruler
discontentedly
fingering
the
rough
cloth
from
which
his
royal
robes
were
fashioned
he
began
to
picture
himself
decked
out
in
splendid
satins
and
velvets
heavily
encrusted
with
jewels
jewels
pah
all
the
jewels
he
had
were
his
plain
gold
scepter
badly
dented
and
bent
from
hurling
at
pinny
penny
taking
off
the
crown
he
scowled
at
it
critically
and
began
considering
the
realms
on
either
side
of
his
own
dominions
to
the
north
there
was
nothing
but
a
sandy
strip
of
desert
and
the
tossing
waters
of
the
nonestic
ocean
east
lay
the
kingdom
of
ix
and
zixie
the
little
queen
he
considered
too
pleasant
and
friendly
to
conquer
besides
the
climate
of
ix
was
not
much
better
than
that
of
his
own
country
to
the
west
of
skampavia
was
merryland
and
at
one
time
a
band
of
his
roistering
skampavians
had
crossed
over
into
that
country
bent
on
theft
and
mischief
recalling
the
way
they
had
been
welcomed
and
entertained
by
the
cheerful
king
of
merryland
and
sent
home
simply
laden
with
presents
he
hastily
dismissed
that
country
too
how
could
he
fight
a
monarch
like
that
to
the
south
lay
the
burning
sands
of
the
deadly
desert
which
no
man
in
his
own
kingdom
had
ever
succeeded
in
crossing
so
having
exhausted
all
the
possibilities
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
skamperoo
tapped
his
foot
in
vexation
and
began
casting
about
in
his
mind
for
some
fair
and
faraway
country
to
conquer
he
closed
his
eyes
in
order
to
think
better
and
was
just
on
the
point
of
falling
into
a
pleasant
doze
of
riches
and
conquest
when
pinny
penny
came
noisily
into
the
room
he
was
preceded
by
two
of
the
king
supervisors
who
urged
forward
by
the
fearless
little
prime
minister
stood
sulkily
and
defiantly
before
the
throne
well
what
now
demanded
skamperoo
blinking
his
eyes
sleepily
can
you
not
handle
these
arguments
yourself
pinny
penny
is
a
king
to
have
no
rest
or
privacy
at
all
instead
of
answering
pinny
penny
took
a
small
cotton
bag
from
the
tallest
of
the
supervisors
and
handed
it
silently
to
the
king
still
half
asleep
skamperoo
untied
the
draw
string
of
the
small
bag
and
emptied
the
contents
into
his
fat
hand
what
he
saw
there
made
his
eyes
fly
open
wide
open
jewels
the
very
thing
for
which
he
had
been
wishing
emeralds
gasped
the
king
rubbing
the
glittering
necklace
between
his
fingers
where
did
you
get
this
twobyfour
they
were
sent
to
your
majesty
by
a
merchant
in
the
second
county
who
got
them
from
a
traveling
peddler
the
peddler
had
got
them
from
a
gilliken
who
had
got
them
from
a
quadling
who
had
got
them
from
a
munchkin
who
had
once
lived
in
the
emerald
city
of
oz
oz
snapped
the
king
sitting
up
very
straight
where
is
oz
oz
is
a
great
and
powerful
kingdom
on
the
other
side
of
the
deadly
desert
answered
twobyfour
looking
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
at
pinny
penny
then
how
did
this
peddler
cross
the
desert
demanded
skamperoo
holding
the
necklace
up
to
the
light
and
feasting
his
eyes
greedily
on
its
gleaming
emeralds
that
i
can
not
say
twobyfour
cast
a
longing
glance
at
the
door
heartily
wishing
himself
on
the
other
side
then
perhaps
you
will
tell
us
why
you
did
not
turn
this
necklace
over
to
the
king
suggested
pinny
penny
mournfully
yes
how
dared
you
keep
it
panted
skamperoo
indignantly
and
what
are
you
gaping
at
threebysix
i
wager
you
were
in
this
too
he
was
shouted
twobyfour
hoarsely
he
tried
to
steal
the
jewels
from
me
that
how
he
got
the
black
eye
but
you
tried
to
steal
them
from
me
and
what
about
my
fine
fellow
twobyfour
turned
a
painful
and
uncomfortable
scarlet
under
the
king
accusing
eye
in
skampavia
we
have
so
little
your
majesty
he
stuttered
miserably
with
these
emeralds
i
thought
i
might
buy
a
bit
of
land
in
some
cooler
and
more
comfortable
country
where
my
wife
and
two
boys
could
be
happy
a
country
where
flowers
would
grow
in
a
garden
and
where
a
man
would
not
have
to
spend
his
whole
life
wrestling
with
rocks
and
weeds
and
drilling
for
hours
in
the
hot
sun
for
no
reason
whatsoever
hah
exclaimed
pinny
penny
looking
meaningly
at
the
king
hah
yourself
grunted
skamperoo
wrathfully
then
as
the
emeralds
continued
to
sparkle
and
glitter
in
his
hand
his
anger
subsided
you
did
very
wrong
to
keep
the
necklace
twobyfour
he
stated
mildly
but
i
have
decided
to
forgive
you
return
now
to
the
second
county
and
explain
to
the
merchant
who
gave
you
this
necklace
that
i
must
have
all
three
all
three
exclaimed
twobyfour
but
he
entitled
by
law
to
two
of
them
my
word
is
the
law
here
and
you
can
choose
between
a
broken
law
or
a
broken
head
skamperoo
told
him
calmly
he
is
the
king
murmured
pinny
penny
in
a
quiet
voice
there
was
nothing
sarcastic
in
the
manner
of
his
speech
but
something
in
the
prime
minister
expression
made
the
king
prickle
all
over
with
discomfort
yes
i
am
the
king
he
shouted
explosively
and
moreover
i
have
spoken
begone
both
of
you
and
you
twobyfour
have
two
days
to
return
with
those
two
necklaces
the
necklaces
or
your
head
do
you
understand
and
er
er
you
may
tell
that
merchant
in
your
county
that
he
need
send
no
more
of
his
wares
to
the
capital
the
three
necklaces
will
suffice
he
bellowed
as
the
two
supervisors
went
bolting
through
the
door
how
nice
they
will
suffice
you
are
the
king
sniffed
pinny
penny
with
a
sour
smile
are
you
a
parrot
or
a
prime
minister
stop
repeating
that
silly
stuff
and
tell
me
about
oz
commanded
skamperoo
clasping
the
emerald
necklace
around
his
fat
throat
have
you
ever
heard
of
this
place
pinny
penny
it
must
be
a
rich
and
marvelous
country
if
peddlers
can
trade
emerald
necklaces
as
carelessly
as
we
trade
wooden
beads
it
is
a
marvelous
country
answered
pinny
penny
thoughtfully
i
remember
my
father
telling
me
about
the
capital
of
oz
an
emerald
city
where
even
the
streets
were
inlaid
with
jewels
and
every
tower
and
wall
was
studded
with
emeralds
well
why
have
i
never
been
told
about
this
wheezed
the
king
peevishly
a
country
like
that
just
a
precious
stone
throw
away
so
to
speak
your
majesty
has
never
cared
for
reading
or
study
pinny
penny
reminded
him
a
bit
maliciously
in
our
library
there
is
a
whole
history
of
oz
fetch
it
fetch
it
bring
it
to
me
at
once
panted
the
king
bouncing
up
and
down
on
his
throne
like
a
big
bad
baby
which
in
truth
he
was
i
must
discover
why
oz
is
so
rich
and
prosperous
while
we
are
so
poor
and
unfortunate
not
so
unfortunate
and
poor
as
we
are
unwise
and
greedy
stated
pinny
penny
stalking
calmly
across
the
room
if
your
majesty
would
study
ways
to
improve
skampavia
and
allow
your
own
subjects
to
keep
a
fair
share
of
their
crops
and
merchandise
we
might
be
a
powerful
country
too
nonsense
what
can
we
do
with
a
rocky
little
desert
like
this
blustered
skamperoo
contemptuously
skampavia
is
a
dull
little
kingdom
a
dumb
little
kingdom
a
kingdumb
that
a
good
name
for
it
and
you
murmured
pinny
penny
under
his
breath
as
he
hastened
away
to
fetch
the
book
on
oz
returning
he
plumped
the
fat
volume
down
on
the
king
knees
and
stood
back
with
folded
arms
well
well
do
you
expect
me
to
read
all
this
wailed
skamperoo
in
dismay
why
it
would
take
a
year
or
more
explain
it
to
me
pinny
penny
just
give
me
the
gist
of
the
matter
just
give
me
the
gist
there
i
made
a
joke
ha
ha
ha
i
made
a
joke
but
oz
is
no
joke
said
the
prime
minister
shortly
your
majesty
had
better
get
that
through
your
head
at
once
now
attend
closely
and
i
will
endeavor
to
give
you
the
most
important
facts
about
this
rich
and
enchanting
country
across
the
desert
in
the
first
place
pinny
penny
looked
severely
over
his
specs
oz
is
about
fifty
times
as
large
as
skampavia
a
great
oblong
undulating
country
divided
into
four
triangular
kingdoms
each
of
these
kingdoms
has
its
own
ruler
but
all
four
are
subject
to
the
rule
of
ozma
of
oz
whose
capital
the
emerald
city
is
in
the
exact
center
of
oz
a
girl
exclaimed
skamperoo
leaning
forward
excitedly
how
can
a
mere
girl
rule
over
an
important
country
like
that
by
using
her
heart
as
well
as
her
head
by

paused
a
moment
to
catch
his
breath
and
then
continued
quietly

noted
for

glinda
the

one
of

just
snaps
the

sighed
the

discontentedly
well

muttered
skamperoo
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
has
this
girl
ruler
a
great
army
stationed
at
her
capital
pinny
penny
grinned
in
spite
of
himself
the
young
fairy
ruler
of
oz
is
opposed
to
all
wars
and
fighting
and
has
at
her
court
an
army
consisting
of
one
tall
soldier
with
green
whiskers
he
explained
hurriedly
one
soldier
with
green
whiskers
shouted
the
king
nearly
tumbling
off
his
throne
i
never
heard
anything
more
ridiculous
in
my
life
i
thought
you
said
oz
was
a
joke
and
yet
you
stand
there
and
tell
me
about
an
army
of
one
soldier
why
that
the
funniest
thing
i
ever
heard
ha
haw
haw
laugh
if
you
wish
said
pinny
penny
resignedly
but
do
forget
that
ozma
has
more
magic
appliances
at
her
finger
tips
than
we
have
pebbles
on
our
desert
in
her
palace
lives
the
famous
wizard
of

who
can
work
every
sort
of
transformation
and
enchantment
but
does
so
only
for
the
good
of
the
country
humph
exclaimed
the
king
well
how
many
fighting
men
have
we
seven
hundred
skampavian
soldiers
in
each
of
the
seven
counties
answered
pinny
penny
reluctantly
but
let
me
warn
your
majesty
that
the
idea
you
have
in
your
head
is
sheer
madness
and
will
lead
to
nothing
but
ruin
take
off
your
crown
put
on
your
night
cap
and
dream
away
this
foolishness
and
a
fine
looking
crown
it
is
snapped
the
king
snatching
off
his
crown
and
looking
at
it
angrily
but
these
emeralds
will
brighten
it
up
a
bit
eh
pinny
penny
it
is
not
the
sparkle
of
gems
in
a
king
crown
that
count
it
is
the
jewels
of
wisdom
in
the
head
under
the
crown
that
make
him
happy
and
well
beloved
stop
enough
yelled
the
king
hurling
the
crown
with
all
his
might
at
pinny
penny
when
will
you
stop
this
infernal
lecturing
and
scolding
when
your
majesty
stops
talking
nonsense
sighed
pinny

the
crown
with
one
hand
and
pulling
a
long
bell

with
the
other
come
now
let
us
have
our
tea
and
forget
about
oz
he
proposed
calmly
lemon
or
cream
your
highness
lemon
growled
the
king
sourly
and
slapping
open
the
book
of
history
on
his
knees
he
stared
long
and
enviously
at
a
picture
of
the
emerald
city
of
oz
chapter
the
king
and
the
merchant
two
days
had
passed
since
skamperoo
had
come
into
possession
of
the
emerald
necklace
he
had
never
taken
it
off
for
a
moment
he
even
wore
it
to
bed
and
spent
most
of
the
daytime
admiring
himself
and
it
in
the
palace
mirrors
now
as
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
drew
to
a
close
he
kept
bouncing
over
to
the
windows
that
commanded
a
view
of
the
highway
if
that
rascal
does
not
turn
up
soon

emeralds
when
you
come
right
down
to
it

whole
miserable
castle
answered
the
king
indignantly
i
can
sell
them
and
buy
no
no
never
part
with
them
he
corrected
himself
hastily
they
give
me
a
feeling
of
importance
and

risen

great
days
are
ahead
hark

that
a

in

back
to

the
portly
monarch
flattened
his
nose
against
the
pane
it
twoby
it

he
shouted
hopping
up
and
down
like
a
school
boy
and
there
a
tall
bearded
stranger
with
him
if
your

will
quietly
seat
yourself
i
endeavor
to
announce

gathering
up
his
cards

a
king
and
not
a
jumping
jack
oh
all
right
skamperoo
flung
himself
heavily
down
among
his
cushions
and
presently
the
tramp
of
feet
along
the
corridor
proclaimed
the
arrival
of
the
long
awaited
supervisor
pinny
penny
advanced
stiffly
to
meet
him
and
after
a
whispered
conversation
he
called
out
in
a
bored
voice
twobyfour
governor
of
our
second
province
and
matiah
the
merchant
your

yes

forward
eagerly
as
the
two
travelers
advanced
respectfully
to
the
throne
drawing
a
small
bag
from
his
leather
jerkin
twobyfour
held
it
sullenly
out
to
the

drew
himself
up
to
his
fullest
height
which
was
pretty
high
i
can
tell
you
perhaps
your
majesty
will
suggest
where
for
these
three
necklaces
i
traded
my
house
my
shops
and
all
my
other
possessions
you

that

skamperoo
and
well
within
his
rights
as
well
we
must
make
a
place
for
him
in
the
palace
what

inquired
practically

opened
his
eyes
very
wide

a
merchant
accustomed
to

very
one
to

out
in
the
kitchen

pinny
penny
brightly
there

no
jewels
but
we
have
onions
and
potatoes
and
with
the
dirty
dishes
and
hampers
of
soiled
linens
you

be
right
at

the
merchant
shrilly
the

stolen
my
emeralds

not
so
loud
begged
skamperoo
leaping
agilely
off
his
throne
and
pattering
anxiously
after

may
leave
us
pinny
penny
i
think
i
can
find
something
better
than
kitchen
work
for
this
honest
citizen
humph
snorted
pinny
penny
and
motioning
for
twobyfour
to
follow
him
he
marched
disapprovingly
from
the
royal
presence
you
must
mind
old
pinny
puffed
the
king
dropping
a
bit
breathlessly
on
his
throne
there
there
now
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfortable
as
i
was
saying
pinny
penny
has
very
odd
notions
at
times
very
odd
agreed
matiah
and
seating
himself
on
a
chair
opposite
the
king
he
fastened
his
eyes
greedily
on
the
sparkling
chains
now
clasped
firmly
about
the
monarch
fat
throat
now
then
we
must
find
something
easy
and
pleasant
for
you
went
on
the
king
scratching
one
ear
reflectively
you
might
er
you
might
spend
your
time
entertaining
me
i
wager
you
are
just
full
of
good
stories
songs
and
amusing
tricks
tricks
exclaimed
the
merchant
elevating
his
nose
disdainfully
then
a
sudden
gleam
came
into
his
small
black
eyes
tricks
he
repeated
more
pleasantly
ah
your
majesty
is
right
how
well
you
have
guessed
my
secret
leaning
forward
he
held
his
hand
up
to
his
mouth
and
looking
furtively
over
his
shoulder
whispered
hoarsely
i
am
a
magician
king
and
well
versed
in
the
arts
of
sorcery
sorcery
cried
skamperoo
clasping
himself
delightedly
about
his
middle
how
perfectly
panormick
magic
is
the
very
thing
we
need
around
here
tell
me
quickly
what
can
you
do
how
much
magic
do
you
know
is
there
some
place
where
we
can
be
quite
alone
matiah
held
up
his
hand
mysteriously
no
one
must
know
i
am
a
magician
it
must
be
a
secret
between
us
of
course
of
course
agreed
the
king
rolling
off
his
throne
with
more
speed
than
dignity
come
to
my
private
walled
garden
no
one
can
hear
us
there
no
one
asked
matiah
sharply
are
there
then
no
guards
upon
the
wall
no
guards
no
servants
no
one
at
all
is
allowed
in
my
garden
the
king
assured
him
proudly
and
is
there
a
door
in
the
garden
wall
matiah
stroking
his
long
beard
stood
regarding
the
king
thoughtfully
my
first
trick
requires
a
door
of
course
there
a
door
or
how
should
i
get
out
and
in
myself
come
along
come
along
waddling
into
the
corridor
skamperoo
started
off
at
a
quick
trot
for
his
private
garden
matiah
grinning
wickedly
to
himself
stepped
softly
after
the
king
once
in
the
garden
he
meant
to
have
his
necklaces
even
if
he
had
to
take
off
the
king
head
to
get
them
one
sweep
of
my
scimiter
murmured
the
merchant
to
himself
ho
ho
this
is
too
easy
the
king
garden
when
they
reached
it
was
no
more
than
a
small
sandy
square
with
some
cactus
plants
in
the
center
and
a
rickety
bench
against
the
wall
seating
himself
heavily
on
the
bench
skamperoo
made
room
for
the
merchant
beside
him
now
then
he
grunted
hurriedly
begin
show
me
what
you
can
do
prove
that
you
are
a
magician
first
i
must
have
the
necklaces
stated
matiah
calmly
without
the
emeralds
i
can
not
do
a
single
trick
but
but
if
the
magic
is
in
the
emeralds
i
can
be
my
own
magician
answered
skamperoo
clutching
the
chains
with
both
hands
but
your
majesty
is
not
a
magician
matiah
told
him
reasonably
you
do
not
know
the
proper
words
or
incantations
no
i
myself
must
wear
these
magic
jewels
and
what
harm
is
there
in
that
as
soon
as
your
wish
is
granted
i
will
hand
them
straight
back
to
you
what
that
can
you
really
grant
wishes
skamperoo
eyes
began
to
snap
and
dance
with
greed
and
interest
certainly
promised
matiah
blinking
shrewdly
across
the
square
and
estimating
with
his
eye
the
distance
he
should
have
to
run
to
reach
the
door
in
the
garden
wall
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
think
of
something
you
want
close
your
eyes
count
slowly
to
a
hundred
and
i
wearing
the
three
necklaces
will
easily
grant
your
wish
i
thought
you
trusted
me
and
that
we
were
going
to
be
friends
he
finished
reproachfully
we
were
er
that
is
here
take
them
unclasping
the
heavy
chains
skamperoo
who
already
had
a
wish
in
mind
thrust
them
into
the
merchant
hands
closing
his
eyes
he
made
his
wish
and
then
began
to
count
hysterically
one
two
three
four
five
six
at
six
matiah
was
half
way
across
the
garden
when
horrors
a
great
white
horse
with
a
golden
tail
and
mane
dropped
like
a
plummet
from
the
sky
pawing
up
the
sand
in
matiah
path
he
flashed
his
yellow
eyes
so
wickedly
the
merchant
fell
back
into
the
cactus
bushes
where
he
lay
screaming
with
shock
pain
and
amazement
but
skamperoo
thinking
all
the
noises
he
heard
were
but
magic
incantations
went
calmly
on
with
his
counting
he
had
reached
sixty
before
matiah
had
recovered
himself
enough
to
crawl
out
of
the
cactus
and
make
his
way
cautiously
back
to
the
bench
the
immense
white
horse
continued
to
stare
at
him
threateningly
but
as
it
made
no
attempt
to
spring
forward
he
began
to
regain
a
little
of
his
usual
assurance
and
courage
great
garoo
then
there
magic
in
the
emeralds
this
horse
was
undoubtedly
the
king
wish
come
true
a
beastly
wish
shuddered
the
merchant
as
he
stared
in
fascination
at
the
pawing
monster
and
wondered
what
to
do
next
he
was
afraid
to
run
past
the
white
horse
and
escape
with
the
jewels
but
hah
he
could
make
a
wish
for
himself
a
wish
that
would
carry
him
and
the
emeralds
far
from
skampavia
the
farther
the
better
closing
his
eyes
he
muttered
a
hurried
sentence
and
waited
tensely
to
be
transported
to
ev
a
country
he
had
once
visited
in
his
youth
but
nothing
at
all
happened
and
gritting
his
teeth
with
vexation
matiah
opened
his
eyes
just
as
skamperoo
finished
counting
a
hundred
so
beamed
the
delighted
monarch
embracing
him
heartily
you
have
done
it
you
really
a
magician
behold
my
horse
a
horse
in
a
thousand
a
golden
maned
charger
fit
for
a
king
for
a
conqueror
of
all
the
dumb
things
fumed
matiah
wriggling
fiercely
away
from
skamperoo
of
all
the
dumb
things
to
wish
for
a
horse
is
about
the
dumbest
of
all
dumb
whinnied
the
white
steed
with
an
indignant
snort
i
not
a
dumb
beast
i
can
laugh
i
can
talk
that
becoz
i
from
oz
and
my
full
name
is
chalk
cha
lk
quavered
skamperoo
who
had
never
heard
an
animal
speak
a
word
in
his
life
he
he
says
his
name
chalk
the
king
looked
appealingly
at
the
merchant
and
seeing
he
would
have
to
live
up
to
the
role
of
magician
matiah
assumed
an
air
of
careless
superiority
well
he
doubtless
knows
his
own
name
your
majesty
if
he
says
his
name
is
chalk
it
probably
is
chalk
and
the
reason
he
can
talk
is
because
he
comes
from
oz
land
of
the
magic
necklaces
where
all
animals
speak
as
well
as
we
do
better
sniffed
chalk
then
taking
an
experimental
nibble
at
the
cactus
he
gave
a
terrific
squeal
of
pain
and
displeasure
flung
up
his
heels
and
began
to
race
around
the
garden
at
such
a
furious
pace
matiah
and
the
king
jumped
behind
the
bench
and
cowered
miserably
against
the
wall
well
there
you
are
panted
the
merchant
angrily
you
have
your
horse
and
what
now
he
yours
you
know
and
you
have
to
control
him
matiah
ducked
behind
the
king
as
chalk
thundered
past
covering
them
both
with
dust
and
sand
if
you
ask
me
you
simply
wasted
a
wish
why
you
might
have
wished
yourself
a
ton
of
emeralds
or
a
kingdom
ten
times
as
large
and
prosperous
as
skampavia
or
but
there
plenty
of
time
for
that
sputtered
skamperoo
holding
desperately
to
the
bench
since
you
are
a
magician
you
can
grant
all
of
my
wishes
oh
no
no
indeed
matiah
spoke
hastily
remembering
the
way
the
emeralds
had
failed
to
grant
his
wish
i
can
grant
only
one
wish
a
week
he
explained
breathlessly
and
i
trust
next
time
you
will
think
before
you
wish
whoa
there
you
ozian
brute
you
silly
monster
stop
that
whoa
ho
whoa
i
tell
you
are
you
my
master
leaping
lightly
over
the
cactus
chalk
came
to
a
sudden
halt
before
the
bench
no
this
king
is
your
master
answered
matiah
thankfully
enough
speak
to
him
skamper
he
urged
in
a
lower
voice
as
chalk
reared
curiously
up
on
his
hind
legs
to
have
a
good
look
at
the
king
be
behave
yourself
commanded
skamperoo
tearfully
how
do
you
expect
me
to
ride
on
your
back
if
you
act
like
this
ah
so
you
expect
to
ride
me
chalk
came
down
with
a
thud
and
grinned
broadly
at
his
new
master
if
you
have
never
seen
a
horse
grin
you
have
no
idea
how
upsetting
it
can
be
well
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
put
up
with
you
he
neighed
finally
just
call
a
groom
or
a
servant
old
and
see
that
i
served
my
evening
oats
three
apples
and
a
measure
of
corn
certainly
certainly
agreed
the
king
starting
off
on
trembling
legs
well
i
must
say
this
is
splendid
splendid
protested
matiah
hurrying
nervously
after
the
king
he
was
afraid
to
stay
in
the
garden
with
chalk
where
do
you
expect
to
get
taking
orders
from
a
horse
i
suppose
you
prefer
me
to
take
them
from
you
puffed
skamperoo
beginning
to
grow
a
little
angry
himself
here
give
me
my
necklaces
snatching
the
emeralds
from
the
merchant
neck
he
went
charging
into
the
palace
hardly
knowing
whether
to
be
glad
or
sorry
for
the
sudden
change
in
his
fortunes
but
by
the
time
he
reached
his
throne
room
he
had
calmed
down
considerably
seating
himself
hurriedly
on
his
throne
he
pondered
how
he
could
keep
all
these
strange
occurrences
from
pinny
penny
he
felt
sure
pinny
penny
would
never
approve
of
magic
necklaces
or
a
talking
horse
well
now
he
just
tell
his
meddlesome
prime
minister
that
the
stamping
snorting
steed
in
the
garden
belonged
to
matiah
and
must
be
fed
and
stabled
when
he
made
another
wish
and
he
had
a
whole
week
to
think
about
that
when
he
made
another
wish
he
would
be
careful
to
wish
for
everything
he
needed
as
for
this
whiskery
wizard
he
would
flatter
him
along
until
he
discovered
the
right
magic
to
use
with
the
emeralds
then
he
would
wish
him
away
like
that
like
that
snapping
his
fingers
spitefully
skamperoo
pulled
the
long
bell
cord
that
summoned
pinny
penny
his
royal
charger
should
be
fed
not
many
monarchs
had
a
talking
horse
with
a
golden
mane
aho
but
he
was
coming
on
he
show
pinny
penny
yet
what
a
smart
ruler
he
was
now
matiah
following
the
king
slowly
into
the
palace
had
done
some
reflecting
too
he
resolved
not
to
lose
his
temper
again
with
this
provoking
simpleton
of
a
sovereign
he
would
simply
humor
him
along
and
before
the
week
was
out
he
would
have
another
chance
to
steal
the
necklaces
and
escape
to
some
far
country
there
at
his
leisure
he
would
experiment
until
he
discovered
the
right
way
to
use
them
he
could
not
understand
why
the
king
had
got
his
wish
and
his
own
wish
had
gone
for
nothing
what
was
the
secret
of
the
magic
emeralds
with
his
forehead
still
wrinkled
in
thought
matiah
entered
the
throne
room
and
quietly
seated
himself
in
a
chair
opposite
skamperoo
much
to
his
relief
the
king
neither
reproached
nor
upbraided
him
ah
so
there
you
are
he
cried
in
his
best
voice
i
have
just
sent
pinny
penny
to
feed
your
horse
horse
barked
matiah
starting
up
in
dismay
then
catching
a
meaning
wink
from
the
king
he
quickly
winked
back
it
seemed
wisest
murmured
skamperoo
to
say
nothing
of
your
magic
powers
for
the
present
all
this
will
be
our
secret
he
finished
playfully
oh
yes
yes
indubitably
while
skamperoo
was
still
wondering
what
indubitably
meant
matiah
hurried
out
of
the
room
and
took
a
long
drink
of
water
from
the
fountain
in
the
hall
our
secret
he
repeated
bitterly
to
himself
our
secret
indeed
chapter
more
about
the
emeralds
skamperoo
had
not
slept
a
wink
he
tossed
from
side
to
side
of
the
royal
bed
his
head
simply
buzzing
with
enchanting
plans
for
the
future
with
the
magic
emeralds
he
could
have
everything
he
desired
and
his
desires
and
wishes
were
multiplying
so
rapidly
he
scarcely
knew
where
to
begin
or
what
to
wish
first
the
necklaces
pressed
uncomfortably
against
his
throat
but
he
would
not
take
them
off
he
was
so
weary
he
ached
in
every
bone
but
still
he
could
not
stop
thinking
and
just
as
the
castle
clock
tolled
seven
the
very
thing
he
should
wish
for
first
came
suddenly
to
him
ah
that
was
it
too
bad
he
had
to
wait
a
whole
week
but
a
week
would
pass
and
perhaps
during
that
time
he
would
discover
for
himself
the
magic
secret
of
his
sparkling
new
treasures
then
he
could
be
his
own
magician
and
put
that
meddlesome
merchant
in
his
place
as
he
was
running
over
in
his
mind
possible
places
to
send
matiah
the
door
of
his
room
opened
cautiously
and
pinny
penny
stuck
in
his
head
well
well
and
did
i
ring
grunted
skamperoo
fretfully
this
is
a
fine
time
to
awaken
an
emperor
emperor
exclaimed
pinny
penny
coming
all
the
way
into
the
room
and
closing
the
door
since
when
has
skampavia
king
become
an
emperor
oh
go
away
and
do
bother
me
turning
his
back
on
pinny
penny
the
king
thumped
his
pillow
and
closed
his
eyes
as
tightly
as
he
could
it
all
about
the
horse
whispered
pinny
penny
coming
around
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
a
strange
and
magnificent
animal
for
a
mere
merchant
if
i
may
be
permitted
to
say
so
not
only
that
it
talks
it
ordering
the
stable
boys
around
in
a
shocking
manner
and
it
even
told
me
to
mind
my
own
business
well
why
do
you
suggested
skamperoo
rolling
over
on
his
back
of
course
he
talks
pinny
he
an
oz
horse
and
all
animals
from
oz
talk
i
thought
you
knew
that
well
if
this
merchant
has
a
talking
horse
he
is
not
so
poor
as
he
pretends
persisted
pinny
penny
shaking
his
finger
under
the
nose
my
advice
is
to
set
the
fellow
on
his
horse
and
send
him
about
his
business
as
quickly
as
possible
i
do
like
his
looks
skamper
he
mean
and
mischievous
and
mark
my
words
no
good
will
come
of
him
or
his
necklaces
i
do
like
his
looks
any
better
than
you
agreed
the
king
clasping
his
fat
hands
on
his
stomach
but
if
i
keep
the
emeralds
i
must
keep
the
merchant
and
besides
i
a
notion
i
could
ride
that
talking
horse
myself
oh
good
goats
and
gravy
then
i
best
go
and
lay
in
a
supply
of
splints
and
liniment
pushing
his
specs
up
on
his
forehead
pinny
penny
cast
a
disgusted
glance
at
his
huge
reclining
master
and
rushed
hurriedly
from
the
royal
presence
now
matiah
as
you
can
well
imagine
had
slept
no
better
than
the
king
in
the
small
room
to
which
pinny
penny
had
taken
him
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
after
all
he
knew
only
two
facts
about
the
magic
emeralds
the
first
that
they
really
could
under
certain
conditions
grant
wishes
the
second
that
they
must
not
be
worn
by
the
person
making
the
wish
this
much
the
merchant
had
reasoned
out
for
himself
as
the
king
had
got
his
wish
while
he
matiah
was
wearing
the
necklaces
and
he
himself
had
not
got
the
wish
he
made
with
the
emeralds
around
his
own
throat
that
much
seemed
certain
snapping
his
fingers
joyfully
and
feeling
sure
the
king
was
now
wearing
the
jeweled
chains
matiah
made
a
second
wish
counting
slowly
to
a
hundred
but
the
hearty
supper
he
had
ordered
as
a
test
failed
to
appear
and
flinging
himself
down
on
the
bed
he
began
to
rack
his
brains
for
some
other
solution
of
the
mystery
perhaps
the
magic
power
rested
in
a
single
stone
which
he
had
luckily
touched
as
the
king
made
his
wish
holding
his
head
with
both
hands
he
tried
to
remember
exactly
what
he
had
done
as
skamperoo
began
to
count
but
it
was
no
use
he
could
not
recall
a
single
thing
after
he
had
started
to
run
across
the
garden
and
how
concluded
the
infuriated
fellow
was
he
ever
to
discover
the
way
to
use
the
emeralds
without
arousing
the
king
suspicions
or
revealing
the
fact
that
he
knew
no
more
about
them
than
skamperoo
himself
muttering
with
vexation
he
kicked
a
foot
stool
all
the
way
across
the
room
and
sat
staring
morosely
at
the
worn
carpet
the
short
uneasy
nap
he
finally
got
before
morning
did
him
no
good
and
cross
and
jumpy
as
a
cougar
he
made
his
way
to
the
dingy
dining
hall
of
the
palace
the
king
had
already
breakfasted
and
looking
out
of
the
window
matiah
saw
a
terrified
servant
leading
the
talking
horse
around
the
courtyard
skamperoo
following
at
a
safe
distance
the
sight
of
the
stamping
white
charger
made
matiah
shudder
anew
what
a
waste
he
reflected
bitterly
and
if
the
king
grew
fond
of
the
saucy
monster
it
would
make
his
own
task
even
more
difficult
for
until
he
succeeded
in
stealing
the
necklaces
matiah
did
not
intend
to
let
skamperoo
out
of
his
sight
gulping
down
the
weak
coffee
and
cold
eggs
a
shabby
servant
grudgingly
placed
before
him
he
hastened
outside
good
morning
your
majesty
he
called
out
heartily
and
may
i
have
a
word
with
your
royal
highness
what
kind
of
a
word
snickered
chalk
rolling
his
yellow
eyes
roguishly
round
at
the
merchant
give
him
a
word
old
if
that
all
he
wants
the
right
word
for
him
i
should
say
would
be
or
and
then
we
all
could
be
happy
it
is
about
the
necklaces
confided
matiah
ignoring
the
horse
utterly
and
falling
easily
into
step
with
the
king
they
must
be
cleaned
every
day
to
keep
them
in
good
wishing
condition
but
i
was
just
going
for
a
ride
objected
skamperoo
with
a
little
frown
wo
this
afternoon
do
no
now
is
the
proper
time
answered
matiah
impressively
thinking
how
clever
he
was
to
have
invented
this
ruse
to
get
hold
of
the
emeralds
if
your
majesty
will
just
give
them
to
me
i
polish
them
up
while
you
are
er
exercising
no
no
er
that
is
i
better
come
and
help
you
skamperoo
spoke
quickly
i
can
ride
this
afternoon
you
think
so
with
an
exuberant
prance
chalk
rose
on
his
hind
legs
and
spun
around
like
a
pinwheel
well
see
you
later
old
sos
and
with
the
terrified
stable
boy
hanging
to
his
bridle
he
went
galloping
off
to
the
stable
if
you
take
my
advice
you
have
that
creature
knocked
on
the
head
said
matiah
savagely
surely
you
wo
endanger
our
lives
by
riding
on
his
back
our
lives
exclaimed
skamperoo
looking
at
matiah
in
surprise
you
do
not
have
to
ride
him
in
fact
he
really
my
horse
he
stated
jealously
so
long
as
your
majesty
wears
the
magic
necklaces
i
must
go
wherever
you
go
and
do
whatever
you
do
explained
the
merchant
loftily
how
how
very
awkward
in
spite
of
himself
skamperoo
groaned
as
he
thought
how
tiresome
it
would
be
with
matiah
trailing
after
him
from
morning
till
night
i
should
think
a
magician
like
yourself
could
arrange
things
more
sensibly
but
consider
what
is
at
stake
matiah
reminded
him
earnestly
together
we
can
have
and
do
anything
we
wish
is
that
not
worth
a
little
inconvenience
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
but
if
we
are
to
do
everything
together
i
think
i
should
know
the
magic
wishing
formula
as
well
as
you
skamperoo
looked
defiantly
up
at
his
newest
advisor
that
is
impossible
striding
along
stiffly
matiah
shook
his
head
the
incantation
once
revealed
becomes
powerless
only
one
versed
in
magic
is
permitted
to
use
the
emeralds
have
you
thought
at
all
about
your
next
wish
he
asked
anxious
to
direct
the
king
mind
into
more
cheerful
channels
we
should
plan
and
consult
about
it
together
you
know
but
wait
until
we
are
in
your
majesty
throne
room
he
added
quickly
as
skamperoo
began
to
open
and
shut
his
mouth
like
a
fish
without
saying
anything
while
i
am
cleaning
the
necklaces
we
can
talk
it
over
yes
matiah
fingers
fairly
itched
for
the
sparkling
jewels
but
restraining
a
mad
impulse
to
snatch
them
from
the
throat
he
walked
along
quietly
beside
skamperoo
talking
so
calmly
and
convincingly
that
he
soon
had
the
skampavian
monarch
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
reveal
the
wish
that
had
kept
him
awake
most
of
the
night
first
assuring
himself
that
they
were
alone
and
locking
the
door
so
they
would
not
be
disturbed
the
king
seated
himself
at
a
small
table
matiah
drew
up
a
chair
opposite
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
necklaces
reluctantly
skamperoo
handed
them
over
keeping
a
jealous
eye
on
the
jewels
as
the
merchant
began
polishing
them
with
a
small
square
of
silk
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
as
he
rubbed
the
silk
over
the
emeralds
matiah
carefully
examined
each
one
for
some
mark
or
sign
that
would
give
him
a
clue
to
their
magic
power
intent
as
he
was
upon
this
task
a
few
low
spoken
words
of
skamperoo
made
him
sit
suddenly
erect
and
regard
the
king
with
new
respect
and
attention
how
in
thunderation
thought
matiah
wonderingly
had
this
fat
silly
monarch
ever
managed
to
hit
upon
such
a
magnificent
and
wish
and
as
skamperoo
explained
and
elaborated
upon
his
plans
and
schemes
for
the
future
the
merchant
interest
grew
apace
quicker
and
cleverer
than
the
king
he
saw
not
only
the
possibilities
of
this
splendid
wish
but
all
the
difficulties
and
problems
that
must
be
met
and
disposed
of
before
it
could
be
reasonably
granted
leaning
forward
the
emeralds
for
the
moment
forgotten
he
put
his
mouth
close
to
skamperoo
ear
there
are
three
things
that
must
be
done
before
your
wish
can
be
realized
matiah
spoke
tensely
first
second
third
after
each
short
whispered
direction
skamperoo
nodded
to
show
that
he
understood
then
it
will
take
four
wishes
to
do
it
he
sighed
resting
his
elbows
heavily
on
the
table
that
will
be
four
weeks
wo
it
no
perhaps
if
we
are
careful
we
can
work
it
all
into
one
answered
matiah
thoughtfully
and
taking
up
his
bit
of
silk
he
began
polishing
the
emeralds
with
renewed
vigor
the
king
watching
him
forgot
his
former
dislike
and
distrust
matiah
enthusiastic
approval
of
his
plans
made
him
feel
that
perhaps
he
had
misjudged
this
whiskered
stranger
perhaps
he
would
not
wish
him
away
after
all
he
might
prove
very
useful
in
the
strange
and
magnificent
future
that
stretched
ahead
matiah
on
his
part
had
no
such
kindly
intentions
toward
the
king
he
merely
meant
to
make
skamperoo
wish
his
own
and
so
grand
and
daring
was
the
prospect
that
he
grew
more
impatient
than
ever
to
discover
the
way
to
accomplish
it
holding
all
three
necklaces
up
to
the
light
he
squinted
at
them
anxiously
the
chains
seemed
identical
in
every
respect
but
no
what
was
this
one
had
a
diamond
clasp
while
the
clasps
on
the
other
two
were
of
flattened
emeralds
this
then
was
the
solution
the
magic
wishing
power
undoubtedly
rested
in
the
diamond
clasp
revealing
in
no
way
his
satisfaction
and
elation
over
this
important
discovery
matiah
handed
the
necklaces
back
to
the
king
somehow
decided
the
merchant
he
must
make
skamperoo
touch
the
diamond
clasp
while
he
silently
repeated
the
king
wish
but
before
that
he
needed
a
little
time
to
prepare
himself
for
the
grand
and
glorious
years
that
were
to
be
his
as
skamperoo
exhausted
by
so
much
thinking
early
in
the
morning
waddled
wearily
over
to
his
throne
matiah
strode
to
the
book
shelves
located
in
an
adjoining
alcove
while
your
majesty
rests
i
will
have
a
look
at
this
interesting
library
he
murmured
ingratiatingly
and
at
the
same
time
store
up
some
useful
information
for
the
future
skamperoo
sleepily
returned
the
merchant
broad
wink
then
sinking
back
among
his
cushions
closed
his
eyes
from
his
chair
in
the
alcove
matiah
could
keep
the
king
in
view
and
satisfied
that
skamperoo
was
really
asleep
he
began
hurriedly
turning
over
the
pages
of
the
large
volume
pinny
penny
had
but
that
morning
returned
to
the
shelves
soon
he
became
so
absorbed
he
forgot
all
about
the
king
and
that
was
a
pity
for
had
he
taken
the
trouble
to
look
he
would
have
discovered
that
the
king
was
no
longer
chapter
the
king
and
his
talking
horse
now
it
is
true
that
the
king
had
closed
his
eyes
as
matiah
settled
himself
in
the
alcove
to
read
but
he
was
very
far
from
asleep
in
fact
no
more
than
five
minutes
had
been
ticked
away
by
the
clock
in
the
corner
before
skamperoo
straightened
up
as
if
suddenly
struck
by
lightning
casting
a
cautious
look
at
the
quiet
merchant
he
began
to
slide
rapidly
toward
the
door
opening
it
without
a
sound
he
slipped
out
into
the
corridor
and
closing
it
just
as
softly
went
puffing
away
to
the
quarters
of
the
white
wishing
horse
at
the
back
of
the
courtyard
though
usually
unenterprising
and
dull
we
must
credit
skamperoo
with
one
brilliant
idea
as
chalk
had
been
brought
to
skampavia
by
the
magic
emeralds
why
should
he
not
know
the
trick
of
using
them
fairly
panting
with
eagerness
and
impatience
skamperoo
jerked
open
the
door
of
the
stable
and
stepped
recklessly
into
chalk
stall
ah
the
little
kingaling
whinnied
chalk
tossing
his
mane
gaily
for
some
reason
or
other
he
found
his
fat
master
tremendously
amusing
and
while
he
had
an
immediate
desire
to
trample
on
matiah
and
frighten
off
the
stable
boys
he
felt
only
an
affectionate
tolerance
for
the
tubby
little
ruler
of
skampavia
have
you
come
for
your
ride
he
inquired
giving
the
king
a
playful
poke
with
his
soft
nose
no
i
come
to
talk
to
you
wheezed
skamperoo
seating
himself
carefully
on
an
overturned
water
bucket
quick
tell
me
all
you
know
about
these
magic
emeralds
touching
his
three
necklaces
with
a
trembling
forefinger
the
king
looked
imploringly
into
the
face
of
his
new
and
powerful
steed
humph
chalk
shifted
a
mouthful
of
hay
to
his
other
cheek
well
as
to
that
or
rather
them
all
that
i
know
is
nothing
you
forget
that
i
only
came
into
existence
yesterday
afternoon
of
course
of
course
i
was
the
one
who
wished
you
here
explained
the
king
impatiently
you
wished
me
here
mused
chalk
staring
meditatively
at
the
comical
figure
on
the
water
bucket
well
i
hardly
know
whether
to
thank
you
or
to
jump
on
you
with
all
four
feet
even
without
any
experience
at
all
i
can
see
that
this
is
no
place
for
me
you
right
sighed
skamperoo
clasping
his
knees
dejectedly
no
place
for
me
either
that
is
why
i
must
know
about
the
emeralds
they
can
satisfy
our
every
wish
and
if
we
just
knew
how
to
use
them
we
could
go
away
together
you
think
you
could
manage
that
sniffed
chalk
who
had
his
own
opinion
as
to
what
would
happen
once
the
king
mounted
on
his
back
yes
together
insisted
skamperoo
try
to
think
he
begged
earnestly
you
say
you
know
nothing
then
how
did
you
know
you
came
from
oz
and
your
name
and
all
that
that
right
how
did
i
putting
one
ear
forward
and
one
ear
backward
chalk
swallowed
his
hay
with
a
quick
gulp
there
must
be
a
lot
of
stuff
in
my
head
that
i
practically
know
nothing
about
he
reasoned
thoughtfully
suppose
you
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
and
then
i
tell
you
what
i
think
of
it
so
hunching
forward
skamperoo
recounted
the
whole
story
of
the
merchant
and
the
necklaces
how
he
and
matiah
had
retired
to
his
private
garden
how
there
with
the
merchant
wearing
the
emeralds
his
first
wish
had
been
granted
and
a
splendid
wish
it
was
too
sighed
skamperoo
looking
fondly
up
at
his
white
horse
never
forget
that
you
were
my
first
wish
fellow
i
hardly
likely
to
forget
myself
snickered
chalk
loftily
but
attend
closely
old
crown
and
scepter
when
i
dropped
down
into
that
garden
yon
whiskered
merchant
was
running
for
the
gate
as
if
his
life
depended
on
it
he
only
stopped
because
he
was
afraid
to
pass
me
and
from
the
way
he
fell
into
those
cactus
bushes
i
wager
he
was
as
astonished
as
you
were
that
the
emeralds
had
granted
your
wish
chalk
wrinkled
his
forehead
shrewdly
i
do
believe
he
knows
any
more
about
the
necklaces
than
we
do
if
he
did
he
would
never
have
sent
you
one
in
the
first
place
and
he
would
have
granted
all
of
his
own
wishes
and
been
in
some
splendid
other
place
matiah
a
fraud
finished
the
king
horse
vehemently
and
means
to
steal
back
the
emeralds
of
course
of
course
oh
oh
why
did
i
think
of
that
myself
what
shall
we
do
now
wailed
skamperoo
jumping
up
so
quickly
he
overturned
the
bucket
for
chalk
frankly
spoken
opinion
confirmed
his
own
suspicions
of
the
merchant
sit
down
advised
the
white
horse
not
unkindly
i
may
not
be
a
magician
but
i
have
a
little
sense
and
horse
sense
is
what
your
majesty
needs
more
than
anything
else
as
skamperoo
righted
the
bucket
and
meekly
sat
down
again
chalk
closed
his
eyes
standing
silent
and
motionless
for
so
long
the
king
thought
he
had
fallen
into
a
trance
but
just
as
he
began
to
fidget
nervously
about
on
the
uncomfortable
edge
of
the
bucket
the
white
horse
opened
his
eyes
and
flashing
a
triumphant
smile
at
skamperoo
began
calling
in
a
loud
lordly
voice
boy
boy
boy
while
the
king
regarded
him
with
mingled
misgivings
and
admiration
chalk
snapped
out
directions
to
the
clumsy
little
groom
who
came
running
in
answer
to
his
summons
when
his
mane
and
tail
had
been
thoroughly
brushed
and
he
was
decked
out
once
more
in
the
splendid
saddle
and
trappings
he
had
worn
on
his
first
appearance
in
skampavia
he
dismissed
the
groom
with
a
haughty
toss
of
his
head
come
he
breathed
mysteriously
climb
up
skamperoo
and
skamperoodle
before
that
rascally
merchant
even
misses
us
have
you
decided
upon
the
place
we
are
to
go
he
questioned
curiously
as
the
king
made
seven
frantic
attempts
to
put
his
foot
in
the
golden
stirrup
heh
heh
heh
the
other
foot
master
how
do
you
ever
expect
to
mount
that
way
stand
on
the
bucket
kingaling
catch
hold
of
the
saddle
and
pull
it
easy
as
oats
once
you
get
the
hang
of
it
is
it
lying
mournfully
on
his
back
where
he
had
fallen
after
his
last
effort
skamperoo
gazed
mournfully
upward
and
chalk
himself
began
to
champ
snort
and
switch
his
tail
with
irritation
you
wished
me
on
yourself
and
now
it
looks
as
if
you
would
have
to
wish
yourself
on
me
he
muttered
savagely
here
give
me
those
necklaces
hang
them
over
my
ear
and
let
have
done
with
this
shameful
exhibition
you
mean
if
i
wish
myself
upon
your
back
i
will
really
be
there
panted
skamperoo
bouncing
up
like
a
rubber
ball
you
mean
you
have
discovered
the
secret
of
the
emeralds
certainly
the
white
horse
regarded
him
scornfully
through
eyes
and
the
king
all
too
willing
to
be
convinced
unclasped
his
three
necklaces
and
standing
on
tip
toe
hung
them
over
chalk
right
ear
i
i
wish
to
be
upon
this
creature
back
puffed
skamperoo
his
cheeks
swelling
out
with
suspense
and
importance
one
two
three
four
five
six
and
scarcely
had
he
begun
to
count
before
he
found
himself
firmly
seated
in
the
saddle
now
now
not
another
word
commanded
chalk
sternly
before
you
dare
to
speak
take
those
emeralds
off
my
ear
with
shaking
hands
the
king
did
as
he
was
told
his
heart
pounding
so
violently
it
almost
kicked
a
hole
in
his
shirt
that
right
directed
the
white
horse
more
mildly
now
suppose
you
tell
me
where
you
intend
to
wish
us
and
what
we
do
after
that
wishes
are
pretty
quick
you
know
and
it
is
best
to
be
prepared
but
but
i
can
not
understand
how
you
made
them
work
spluttered
skamperoo
it
wonderful
it
marvelous
do
you
understand
what
this
means
perfectly
chalk
rolled
his
eyes
triumphantly
round
at
his
greedy
little
master
my
head
seems
to
be
full
of
magic
which
is
not
strange
seeing
that
i
was
magically
brought
into
existence
and
the
trick
of
the
necklaces
once
i
got
to
thinking
about
them
is
quite
simple
now
i
am
what
i
am
a
horse
and
quite
satisfied
but
you
with
these
emeralds
may
easily
make
a
jackass
of
yourself
so
you
had
better
tell
me
what
you
wish
before
you
wish
it
for
instance
he
went
on
reprovingly
if
instead
of
wishing
yourself
upon
my
back
you
had
wished
yourself
a
good
horseman
how
much
wiser
that
would
have
been
there
a
lot
more
to
riding
than
getting
into
the
saddle
you
know
but
never
mind
that
now
what
was
this
great
big
wish
you
and
matiah
were
planning
together
leaning
so
far
forward
he
almost
lost
his
balance
skamperoo
hurriedly
whispered
into
chalk
left
ear
his
grand
and
glorious
wish
for
the
future
being
careful
to
add
to
his
own
wish
the
three
crafty
suggestions
made
by
the
clever
merchant
you
are
sure
this
is
what
you
desire
chalk
looked
sharply
and
a
little
sadly
at
the
rotund
and
royal
figure
on
his
back
you
mean
to
go
away
and
leave
your
own
people
without
a
thought
or
care
there
anyone
here
you
would
like
to
take
along
or
give
a
share
of
your
good
fortune
the
king
shook
his
head
violently
i
might
make
a
wish
for
pinny
penny
he
added
rather
sheepishly
good
idea
sniffed
chalk
what
are
you
going
to
give
old
skinny
pins
you
know
i
rather
like
that
old
codger
without
delay
and
a
bit
spitefully
the
king
told
him
and
as
this
time
chalk
found
no
fault
with
the
wish
skamperoo
again
placed
the
emeralds
over
chalk
ear
and
quickly
spoke
nine
words
then
without
waiting
to
see
whether
pinny
penny
got
his
wish
chalk
again
took
command
if
you
do
exactly
as
i
say
we
get
off
before
matiah
discovers
you
are
gone
and
comes
down
here
to
slice
off
your
head
to
get
his
necklaces
said
the
white
horse
severely
lowering
his
voice
to
a
whisper
he
slowly
enunciated
four
brief
sentences
tingling
partly
with
fright
and
partly
with
anticipation
skamperoo
repeated
the
four
sentences
after
chalk
and
began
his
counting
but
stars
scarcely
had
he
reached
ten
before
he
felt
a
great
lift
and
lurch
had
just
time
to
snatch
back
his
emeralds
and
seize
the
reins
before
he
and
the
huge
white
wishing
horse
without
leaving
even
a
rustle
in
the
quiet
air
had
gone
vanished
and
completely
disappeared
from
skampavia
chapter
a
great
celebration
in
oz
why
all
the
crown
jewels
old
toz
resting
his
chin
on
the
window
ledge
highboy
looked
inquiringly
into
the
dressing
room
of
joe
king
ruler
of
the
gillikens
and
all
of
the
purple
countries
of
oz
the
king
apartment
was
on
the
tenth
floor
of
the
royal
palace
but
this
made
no
difference
to
highboy
for
highboy
was
a
giant
horse
whose
telescope
legs
could
be
raised
or
lowered
to
any
level
making
him
one
of
the
most
amazing
and
amusing
animals
in
oz
i
say
are
we
going
anywhere
in
particular
he
drawled
curiously
as
the
king
decked
out
in
his
best
braided
traveling
coat
and
amethyst
crown
surveyed
himself
cheerfully
in
the
long
mirror
we
chuckled
the
merry
monarch
turning
round
with
a
hearty
roar
ho
ho
ho
and
how
do
you
know
you
are
going
well
i
see
you
are
wearing
your
best
purple
boots
and
when
the
king
of
all
the
gillikens
wears
his
best
purple
boots
he
usually
rides
his
best
purple
horse
does
he
not
right
admitted
the
king
good
naturedly
and
i
might
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
we
are
going
to
the
capital
at
the
express
invitation
of
her
imperial
highness
queen
ozma
of
oz
the
king
cleared
his
throat
importantly
there
is
to
be
an
immense
festival
to
celebrate
the
discovery
of
oz
by
mortals
the
honors
to
be
equally
divided
between
the
famous
wizard
who
arrived
here
in
a
balloon
from
omaha
many
years
ago
and
little
dorothy
who
came
by
way
of
a
kansas
cyclone
somewhat
later
not
only
will
the
rulers
of
all
four
oz
kingdoms
be
present
but
many
other
important
and
royal
personages
as
well
well
well
indeed
trumpeted
the
giant
horse
shrilly
there
you
stand
all
shined
up
like
a
door
knob
and
never
a
word
to
me
how
i
look
why
was
i
told
before
when
do
we
start
just
as
soon
as
her
majesty
decides
what
to
wear
and
what
to
take
with
her
answered
the
king
with
a
solemn
wink
oh
then
i
have
bushels
of
time
highboy
sighed
heavily
with
relief
so
we
invited
to
the
emerald
city
eh
how
perfectly
perf
how
simply
magnif
billy
tommy
jim
as
he
called
the
name
of
each
little
groom
highboy
let
himself
down
a
couple
of
stories
and
by
the
time
he
reached
a
usual
horse
height
and
level
on
the
ground
he
had
ordered
himself
a
bath
a
mane
wave
an
oil
shampoo
and
a
hooficure
indeed
highboy
plans
for
the
party
went
on
apace
and
with
the
three
grooms
pattering
after
him
with
buckets
brushes
and
sponges
he
trotted
anxiously
up
and
down
his
great
airy
stable
picking
out
his
most
splendid
saddle
and
bridle
and
blanket
for
the
journey
the
giant
horse
wished
to
make
an
impression
that
would
uphold
if
not
enhance
the
honor
and
reputation
of
the
gillikens
he
was
eager
to
renew
his
friendship
with
trot
a
little
mortal
girl
who
lived
in
the
palace
and
with
herby
the
medicine
man
and
the
many
other
interesting
characters
he
had
met
on
a
former
visit
to
the
capital
in
the
munchkin
quadling
and
winkie
kingdoms
there
was
also
a
lively
bustle
and
stir
of
preparation
and
in
many
of
the
lesser
kingdoms
the
kings
queens
and
potentates
made
ready
for
the
great
spring
festival
in
the
emerald
city
and
you
can
imagine
the
fun
and
excitement
in
the
capital
itself
everyone
had
some
special
part
in
the
program
even
the
dogs
and
cats
ran
importantly
about
on
countless
errands
like
small
messengers
their
ears
and
tails
quivering
with
interest
and
expectancy
after
the
visitors
had
been
officially
welcomed
at
the
gates
of
the
city
there
was
to
be
an
imperial
procession
with
bands
floats
and
favors
for
everybody
then
there
were
to
be
games
races
and
other
exciting
athletic
events
and
a
grand
banquet
in
the
royal
palace
a
magic
lantern
ball
in
ozma
garden
would
complete
the
festivities
for
the
first
day
for
the
second
pageants
and
tableaux
depicting
the
important
and
historical
events
of
ozian
history
had
been
arranged
for
the
morning
notta
bit
more
a
circus
clown
who
had
come
to
oz
from
philadelphia
was
putting
on
an
outdoor
circus
in
the
afternoon
helped
by
bob
up
the
orphan
who
had
come
with
him
and
all
the
famous
animals
in
the
emerald
city
from
the
squeals
shouts
and
hilarious
chuckles
issuing
from
the
huge
white
tent
set
just
beyond
the
city
wall
it
promised
to
be
an
unqualified
success
after
the
circus
ozma
had
planned
a
picnic
supper
on
the
banks
of
the
winkie
river
to
be
followed
by
demonstrations
in
magic
by
the
wizard
of
oz
and
glinda
the
good
sorceress
of
the
south
and
last
but
not
least
a
lavish
display
of
fireworks
sent
especially
for
the
grand
occasion
by
happy
toko
emperor
of
the
silver
isles
no
wonder
the
children
in
the
emerald
city
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
coming
celebration
no
wonder
dorothy
trot
and
bettsy
bobbin
the
little
mortals
who
lived
in
the
great
palace
and
were
princesses
in
their
own
right
were
too
busy
to
think
of
their
titles
or
bother
with
their
crowns
dorothy
the
first
of
the
three
to
reach
the
capital
was
ozma
favorite
companion
and
dorothy
was
perhaps
the
busiest
of
all
not
only
had
she
planned
all
the
tableaux
and
pageants
but
had
entire
charge
of
decorating
the
palace
and
the
emerald
city
as
well
the
scarecrow
whom
dorothy
had
discovered
on
her
earliest
trip
to
oz
was
her
most
willing
and
tireless
assistant
this
lively
gentleman
had
brains
given
him
by
the
wizard
and
was
in
high
favor
and
constant
demand
because
of
his
natural
cheerfulness
and
amiable
disposition
at
the
moment
he
and
dorothy
were
superintending
the
erection
of
a
floral
arch
over
the
great
jeweled
gates
of
the
city
this
arch
grown
and
tended
by
the
wizard
was
so
magically
compounded
that
as
each
visitor
rode
through
the
gateway
a
bouquet
of
fragrant
spring
flowers
dropped
lightly
into
his
or
her
lap
dorothy
and
the
scarecrow
had
tried
it
out
to
their
complete
delight
and
satisfaction
and
now
clasping
their
large
bouquets
watched
three
energetic
little
gardeners
tie
up
the
last
tendrils
of
the
magic
vine
to
the
gaily
painted
arbor
you
know
said
dorothy
peering
over
the
flower
tops
at
the
scarecrow
i
can
hardly
wait
till
tomorrow
to
think
we
be
seeing
sir
hokus
and
ojo
and
unk
nunkie
and
urtha
and
prince
tatters
and
all
the
others
and
they
be
seeing
us
too
remember
that
beamed
the
scarecrow
closing
one
cotton
eye
and
now
if
you
think
you
can
manage
for
a
few
minutes
without
me
i
had
better
go
and
study
up
on
my
speech
of
welcome
oh
are
you
making
the
speech
of
welcome
how
grand
how
thrilling
dorothy
gazed
admiringly
up
at
her
oldest
friend
in
oz
yes
and
i
also
making
the
speech
awarding
medals
to
the
discoverers
of
our
country
confided
the
scarecrow
thrusting
out
his
chin
and
striking
an
attitude
how
will
you
feel
when
i
pin
that
medal
on
your
chest
my
girl
well
sighed
dorothy
looking
dreamily
over
her
bouquet
i
feel
any
happier
than
i
do
now
but
it
certainly
will
be
a
great
honor
scarecrow
a
great
honor
well
i
should
snickerty
wicker
but
what
if
i
forget
my
speech
right
in
the
middle
of
a
word
the
scarecrow
pushed
back
his
old
blue
hat
and
puckered
up
his
forehead
anxiously
how
will
i
feel
with
all
those
kings
and
queens
staring
right
at
me
really
i
think
ozma
had
better
have
someone
else
make
the
speeches
oh
go
along
with
you
laughed
dorothy
giving
him
a
little
push
have
you
magic
brains
you
be
a
splendid
speechmaker
do
you
think
so
well
i
do
my
best
somewhat
reassured
the
scarecrow
patted
dorothy
on
the
shoulder
and
started
off
through
the
park
dorothy
could
tell
from
the
way
he
flung
his
arms
about
that
he
was
rehearsing
and
with
an
amused
little
smile
she
hurried
back
to
the
palace
to
put
the
finishing
touches
to
the
decorations
for
throne
room
half
way
there
she
met
the
hungry
tiger
carrying
a
large
basket
in
his
teeth
and
followed
by
ten
little
kitchen
boys
also
bearing
enormous
baskets
good
gracious
tige
what
this
dorothy
stared
at
the
little
procession
in
surprise
the
hungry
tiger
and
cowardly
lion
have
lived
in
the
emerald
city
almost
as
long
as
dorothy
and
though
the
appetite
is
tremendous
and
he
is
always
threatening
to
eat
a
fat
baby
he
has
never
yet
done
it
and
is
tame
as
dorothy
pet
kitten
eureka
oh
had
you
heard
the
hungry
tiger
set
down
his
basket
and
smoothed
back
his
whiskers
complacently
i
the
head
of
the
reception
committee
for
all
visiting
animals
and
am
on
my
way
now
to
buy
refreshments
for
the
great
banquet
and
picnic
and
trust
me
he
gave
dorothy
a
broad
wink
to
do
it
right
just
let
me
see
that
list
kapo
taking
a
long
slip
from
the
first
kitchen
boy
he
began
to
drone
off
the
names
of
the
capital
famous
citizens
and
then
the
list
of
visitors
of
course
there
must
be
meat
for
the
cowardly
lion
and
myself
mused
the
tiger
blinking
his
eyes
sleepily
then
there
hank
bettsy
bobbin
mule
and
doubty
that
dromedary
you
and
sir
hokus
brought
back
from
one
of
those
strange
journeys
and
we
must
forget
iffin
though
he
does
eat
much
put
down
a
box
of
violets
and
geraniums
for
the
iffin
kapo
my
lad
ozma
saw
horse
and
the
woozy
being
of
wood
do
care
for
food
but
that
fine
pink
pig
pigasus
eats
enough
for
a
dozen
horses
and
toto
your
little
dog
and
billina
must
be
taken
care
of
too
and
scrap
bear
grumpy
of
course
agreed
dorothy
leaning
her
elbow
on
the
tiger
back
so
she
could
read
the
list
over
his
shoulder
but
they
all
live
here
who
coming
from
foreign
parts
tiger
well
confided
the
tiger
you
be
glad
to
know
our
old
friend
the
comfortable
camel
is
making
the
trip
with
hokus
i
mean
the
yellow
knight
and
marygolden
the
princess
he
married
is
riding
a
warhorse
named
stampedro
the
king
and
queen
of
the
gillikens
will
make
the
trip
on
the
giant
horse
quite
a
lot
of
horses
are
there
and
i
hope
highboy
keeps
his
legs
in
bounds
it
makes
me
nervous
to
see
a
creature
one
height
one
minute
and
another
height
the
next
you
knew
the
prince
of
pumperdink
was
bringing
kabumpo
the
elegant
elephant
do
you
mean
that
kabumpo
is
bringing
him
put
in
dorothy
mischievously
and
wo
you
be
glad
to
see
him
again
yes
i
be
glad
enough
to
see
him
murmured
the
tiger
but
feeding
him
is
quite
a
big
problem
well
you
just
the
one
to
do
it
said
dorothy
smoothing
away
the
wrinkle
between
the
tiger
pointed
ears
you
have
such
a
big
appetite
yourself
you
know
just
how
hungry
an
elephant
would
feel
i
see
you
got
roger
down
too
i
pretty
sure
king
ato
will
bring
his
read
bird
so
i
ordering
a
dozen
boxes
of
animal
crackers
for
roger
and
a
barrel
of
apples
for
snufferbux
i
wonder
if
he
dance
for
us
dorothy
eyes
brightened
for
she
had
taken
a
great
fancy
to
the
faithful
bear
with
whom
ojo
had
traveled
all
over
oz
he
bound
to
be
jolly
and
full
of
fun
and
hungry
as
a
bear
sighed
the
tiger
with
a
worried
frown
but
that
is
easy
compared
to
a
dragon
king
cheeriobed
is
bringing
a
dragon
and
this
dragon
on
a
diet
of
mustard
and
sulphur
think
of
that
my
child
and
say
i
best
get
along
or
i
never
get
my
marketing
done
and
i
must
go
too
said
dorothy
reminded
of
her
many
responsibilities
so
giving
the
tiger
ear
an
affectionate
pull
she
ran
all
the
way
back
to
the
palace
in
the
throne
room
she
found
ozma
and
tik
tok
in
a
quiet
conference
i
made
tik
tok
master
of
ceremonies
said
ozma
looking
up
with
a
smile
of
welcome
because
he
never
forgets
what
he
wound
up
to
remember
and
i
be
sure
to
keep
him
wound
up
promised
dorothy
patting
the
machine
man
on
his
copper
shoulder
tik
tok
was
another
of
discoveries
and
had
been
manufactured
by
a
magician
to
be
a
slave
of
the
king
of
ev
but
here
he
was
thanks
to
dorothy
enjoying
a
life
of
interest
and
ease
in
the
capital
tik
tok
could
talk
think
and
move
about
as
well
as
anyone
when
he
was
wound
and
was
much
more
reliable
and
tireless
than
a
real
person
i
am
to
the
as
they
the
and
them
to
their
tik
tok
told
dorothy
in
his
slow
and
precise
manner
can
on
me
and
thing
will
go
like
with
two
stiff
bows
and
ticking
with
importance
the
metal
man
marched
proudly
from
the
room
like
ha
ha
did
you
hear
that
and
why
not
with
a
man
in
charge
oh
ozma
does
it
all
look
grand
and
gorgeous
clasping
the
little
queen
around
her
slender
waist
dorothy
gazed
around
the
beautiful
throne
room
every
window
and
doorway
was
garlanded
with
flowers
while
hundreds
of
palms
ferns
and
fluttering
silk
pennants
gave
it
an
unwonted
look
of
pomp
and
ceremony
let
me
see
mused
dorothy
straightening
the
folds
of
a
white
satin
curtain
i
to
stand
on
your
right
bettsy
bobbin
and
trot
on
your
left
and
the
patchwork
girl
is
to
hold
your
train
at
the
grand
reception
do
you
think
you
can
trust
her
ozma
she
probably
try
to
jump
rope
or
wave
it
like
a
handkerchief
oh
scraps
is
pretty
good
considering
her
giddy
make
up
observed
ozma
with
a
little
smile
and
she
would
be
so
disappointed
not
to
be
with
us
i
sure
i
can
trust
her
at
least
for
a
little
while
trust
me
trust
me
you
disgust
me
shouted
a
merry
voice
and
scraps
who
had
been
peeking
through
the
curtains
at
the
back
of
the
room
took
a
long
running
slide
landing
in
an
unladylike
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
dais
leading
to
the
throne
scraps
made
from
an
old
crazy
quilt
and
stuffed
with
cotton
had
been
brought
to
life
by
a
magician
to
serve
his
wife
but
the
patch
work
girl
had
come
to
the
emerald
city
with
ojo
and
never
returned
to
her
creators
scorning
the
humble
career
of
a
maid
servant
she
was
so
gay
and
amusing
ozma
had
allowed
her
to
remain
at
the
palace
must
i
go
in
training
to
hold
a
train
she
demanded
springing
to
her
feet
and
striking
so
comical
an
attitude
both
dorothy
and
ozma
had
to
laugh
of
course
not
said
ozma
kindly
just
be
careful
and
do
not
do
any
gymnastics
during
the
reception
oh
i
be
careful
and
so
dignified
i
probably
split
a
seam
but
wait
till
you
see
the
stunt
i
to
put
on
for
the
big
show
puffed
scraps
snapping
her
button
eyes
boastfully
i
to
walk
the
tight
rope
in
notta
circus
so
so
long
girls
i
must
go
and
practice
well
even
if
she
falls
it
wo
matter
remarked
dorothy
with
a
slight
shudder
as
the
patch
work
girl
jumped
recklessly
out
of
the
window
and
picking
herself
up
set
off
for
the
circus
grounds
on
the
edge
of
the
park
oh
ozma
with
all
the
interesting
people
here
already
and
with
all
the
grand
and
exciting
ones
who
are
coming
i
believe
we
have
the
best
time
we
ever
had
since
oz
was
discovered
are
you
glad
you
discovered
us
giving
her
an
affectionate
squeeze
ozma
linked
her
arm
through
dorothy
let
see
how
the
wizard
is
getting
on
with
his
tricks
for
the
picnic
dorothy
nodded
eagerly
and
hand
in
hand
the
two
girls
hurried
across
the
corridor
to
the
laboratory
of
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
chapter
a
strange
warning
the
first
day
of
the
grand
celebration
dawned
clear
and
bright
the
emerald
city
had
never
seemed
more
sparkling
or
fair
flags
fluttered
from
every
tower
and
turret
of
the
palace
each
house
wore
a
garland
of
flowers
and
flaunted
a
dozen
silken
banners
in
the
fresh
spring
breeze
the
streets
were
alive
with
ozma
subjects
suitably
costumed
for
the
big
parade
and
when
shortly
after
noon
the
royal
visitors
began
to
arrive
the
castle
bells
broke
into
a
joyous
tolling
the
hundred
bands
struck
up
the
oz
national
anthem
and
the
magnificent
and
beautiful
floats
began
to
swing
into
line
the
scarecrow
address
of
welcome
at
the
city
gates
had
been
greeted
with
wild
enthusiasm
and
applause
and
now
happy
but
somewhat
breathless
the
indefatigable
straw
man
mounted
on
the
saw
horse
was
leading
the
illustrious
guests
into
the
city
where
they
were
to
join
the
royal
procession
and
proceed
in
triumph
to
the
west
gardens
of
the
park
what
shouts
and
cheers
went
up
from
the
happy
throngs
as
that
impressive
company
in
their
glittering
coaches
or
riding
their
favorite
steeds
moved
majestically
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
directly
following
the
scarecrow
all
in
red
and
wearing
her
tallest
ruby
crown
was
glinda
the
good
sorceress
of
the
south
her
chariot
seeming
to
float
by
itself
marching
cheerfully
after
the
ruler
of
the
quadlings
came
nick
chopper
the
nickel
plated
emperor
of
the
winkies
polished
to
the
highest
degree
but
democratically
afoot
marching
in
the
center
of
his
ten
splendid
uniformed
winkie
guards
a
few
steps
behind
the
tin
woodman
and
prancing
along
in
hardly
restrained
exuberance
was
the
giant
horse
proudly
bearing
joe
king
and
queen
hyacinth
king
and
queen
of
the
gillikens
and
highboy
not
only
carried
his
own
head
high
but
he
had
elevated
his
sovereigns
above
everyone
else
in
the
procession
so
that
none
could
miss
the
happily
smiling
rulers
of
the
north
a
dazzling
blue
dragon
had
pulled
the
coach
of
king
cheeriobed
queen
orin
and
prince
philador
all
the
way
from
sapphire
city
and
an
sight
was
the
royal
family
of
the
munchkins
kabumpo
the
elegant
elephant
resplendent
in
his
jeweled
robe
swayed
haughtily
along
after
cheeriobed
blue
coach
waving
his
trunk
in
a
dignified
way
to
his
friends
in
the
crowd
in
the
canopied
seat
on
his
back
rode
prince
pompadore
and
peg
amy
of
pumperdink
easily
the
handsomest
young
couple
in
oz
peering
mischievously
out
the
side
of
his
gaily
painted
jinrikisha
was
the
merry
red
jinn
himself
and
no
one
could
view
the
rotund
little
wizard
of
ev
without
feeling
happier
jinnicky
body
was
a
great
red
jar
he
wore
the
lid
for
a
hat
and
when
he
grew
bored
or
sleepy
he
would
simply
retire
into
himself
like
a
turtle
but
now
he
did
not
feel
at
all
like
retiring
and
was
showering
ginger
cookies
right
and
left
and
simply
beaming
with
interest
and
jollity
the
king
and
queen
of
ragbad
rolled
briskly
along
in
their
shabby
but
comfortable
open
coach
with
them
were
prince
tatters
urtha
his
flowery
little
princess
and
grandpa
an
old
soldier
with
a
wooden
leg
who
had
gone
through
many
wars
and
hardships
for
the
sake
of
his
country
but
the
shout
that
greeted
the
yellow
knight
was
loudest
and
longest
of
all
the
prince
of
corumbia
had
lived
in
the
emerald
city
for
many
years
as
sir
hokus
of
pokes
before
he
was
disenchanted
and
became
the
young
and
charming

of

the
comfortable

proudly
on

reading
out

bowled
merrily
over

and
chuckling
to

in

by

came

proudly
mounted
on

this

who
had
happened
to
be

the
time

not

send
her
horn
darting
out
like
a
lance
but
could
blow
it
as
well
the
sound
of
its
clear
notes
made
many
a
trumpeter
in
ozma
band
turn
round
with
surprise
and
envy
drawn
up
to
meet
her
impressive
visitors
was
ozma
herself
the
royal
float
of
her
imperial
highness
was
formed
like
a
sea
shell
on
an
uncut
emerald
in
the
center
sat
the
little
ruler
of
all
the
ozians
dressed
in
a
shimmering
white
robe
wearing
her
flashing
emerald
crown
and
never
in
all
the
thousand
years
of
her
young
life
had
this
lovely
young
fairy
looked
more
beautiful
also
in
white
were
her
attendants
dorothy
bettsy
and
trot
each
wearing
an
emerald
circlet
and
carrying
a
long
wand
draped
with
spring
flowers

the
scarecrow
brought
his
bright
cavalcade
to
a
triumphant
halt

waiting
for
the
royal

and
mounts
of
the
visitors
to
pass
swept
after
them
in
a
burst
of
music
and
color
the
wizard
of
oz
had
chosen
a
huge
revolving
green
ball
on
which
the
nimble
little
necromancer
ably
kept
his
balance
as
he
propelled
himself
along

clinging
precariously
to
the
doubtful

the

rattling
like
castanets
was
another
figure
of
interest

the
antics
of

kept
the

operated
himself
benny
the

statue
of
a
public
benefactor
who
had
come
to

from

strode
solidly
along
an
expression
of
pride
and
deep
satisfaction
on
his
features
beside
benny
marched
the
soldier
with
green
whiskers
looking
neither
to

left
or
right
as
became
a
man
who
represented
in
his
own
person
the
whole
and
entire
army
of
oz
i
have
only
mentioned
the
most
outstanding
of
the
emerald
city
paraders
besides
these
there
were
countless
marchers
and
hundreds
of
miniature
castles
ships
huge
sea
serpents
and
dragons
and
in
a
blaze
of
color
and
harmony
they
wound
through
the
streets
of
the
capital
ending
up
in
the
west
gardens
of
the
palace
where
the
boys
and
girls
from
professor
wogglebug
athletic
college
distinguished
themselves
in
a
series
of
gymnastic
displays
and
the
scarecrow
established
an
record
for
pole
vaulting
by
the
time
ozma
had
awarded
the
cups
and
trophies
the
sun
had
begun
to
slip
down
behind
the
treetops
and
in
high
spirits
and
with
splendid
appetites
the
royal
party
and
the
royal
guests
turned
toward
the
castle
here
tik
tok
who
had
hurried
on
ahead
nobly
discharged
his
duties
as
master
of
ceremonies
the
cowardly
lion
did
the
honors
for
the
four
footed
visitors
leading
each
to
an
airy
stall
in
the
royal
stable
so
they
could
rest
and
refresh
themselves
before
the
grand
banquet
and
how
shall
i
do
justice
to
that
dazzling
affair
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
magnificent
dining
hall
was
filled
to
capacity
easily
as
large
as
a
city
park
there
was
just
room
for
the
two
long
sparkling
banquet
tables
the
first
for
ozma
courtiers
and
guests
the
second
for
the
palace
pets
and
visiting
animals
the
scarecrow
caused
a
roar
of
hilarity
as
the
diners
took
their
places
by
donning
a
pair
of
dark
spectacles
to
prevent
from
the
flashing
of
so
many
jewels
and
crowns
with
each
course
of
the
long
delicious
dinner
ozma
had
a
different
king
queen
or
celebrity
at
her
side
and
so
cleverly
had
it
all
been
arranged
each
guest
had
the
honor
of
sitting
for
a
time
beside
the
kingdom
little
fairy
ruler
soft
music
floated
down
from
the
balcony
where
the
royal
orchestra
was
concealed
behind
a
bower
of
palms
the
bright
robes
and
jewels
of
the
banqueters
and
the
emerald
and
silver
dinner
service
twinkled
and
sparkled
in
the
magic
glow
of
a
thousand
candles
the
hundred
footmen
were
swift
and
skillful
the
speeches
were
short
and
merry
and
never
thought
dorothy
looking
around
with
a
little
thrill
of
satisfaction
never
has
there
been
so
grand
and
yet
delightful
a
party
the
hungry
tiger
had
remembered
the
tastes
and
appetites
of
each
of
his
guests
and
not
only
were
they
served
with
the
same
dainties
enjoyed
by
the
two
footed
visitors
but
every
one
had
a
special
dish
of
his
own
even
the
dragon
seemed
to
enjoy
immensely
his
matches
and
mustard
then
called
in
a
hoarse
voice
for
three
pails
of
hot
coals
after
which
he
blew
a
whole
series
of
smoke
rings
and
went
comfortably
to
sleep
dorothy
and
the
wizard
had
with
due
modesty
accepted
their
medals
for
their
discovery
of
oz
and
the
whole
company
on
its
feet
for
this
impressive
ceremony
were
suddenly
startled
by
a
shrill
scream
from
the
patch
work
girl
his
beard
his
beard
look
at
his
beard
yodeled
scraps
yes
i
think
yodel
best
describes
the
excited
noise
made
by
this
irrepressible
maiden
his
beard
i
said
it
turning
red
at
the
word
beard
every
eye
turned
to
the
soldier
with
green
whiskers
for
his
beard
was
the
longest
and
most
celebrated
in
oz
why
so
it
is
exclaimed
dorothy
in
astonishment
red
choked
the
solider
desperately
clutching
his
famous
whiskers
oh
oh
my
beautiful
green
beard
it
red
as
fire
oh
oh
how
can
i
ever
be
the
soldier
with
green
whiskers
if
my
beard
stays
red
who
did
this
wizard
wizard
are
you
playing
a
trick
on
me
certainly
not
soldier
i
be
the
last
person
to
tamper
with
your
sacred
beard
quiet
please
quiet
this
is
extremely
odd
and
disturbing
jumping
on
his
chair
the
little
wizard
of
oz
looked
anxiously
around
the
room
do
they
hurt
are
red
whiskers
painful
asked
scraps
while
the
royal
guests
hardly
knowing
whether
to
laugh
or
sympathize
gazed
curiously
at
the
blazing
beard
of
the
army
of
oz
they
they
hurt
my
feelings
blubbered
the
poor
soldier
holding
out
his
bristling
whiskers
in
disgust
i
never
get
used
to
a
red
beard
never
never
why
not
cut
it
off
inquired
prince
pompadore
with
some
difficulty
controlling
his
chuckles
what
cut
off
my
beautiful
whiskers
why
why
i
rather
lose
my
head
moaned
the
soldier
with
a
horrified
shudder
how
would
i
look
how
would
i
fight
oh
oh
this
is
ridiculous
burying
his
face
in
his
napkin
ozma
distracted
army
rushed
violently
from
the
room
if
you
ask
me
observed
the
scarecrow
in
his
droll
voice
no
no
it
magic
muttered
the
wizard
stepping
briskly
down
from
his
chair
wait
i
must
consult
my
book
of
red
magic
and
portents
and
i
go
with
you
offered
jinnicky
rolling
quickly
out
of
his
cushioned
seat
you
know
red
magic
is
my
specialty
so
arm
in
arm
the
wizard
of
oz
and
the
wizard
of
ev
bustled
away
together
well
i
can
tell
you
what
it
means
without
consulting
any
books
said
the
scarecrow
as
ozma
looking
rather
troubled
again
took
her
place
and
motioned
for
the
others
to
do
the
same
it
is
a
warning
declared
the
scarecrow
raising
his
arm
stiffly
someone
is
coming
to
beard
us
in
our
den
pardon
such
an
informal
reference
to
your
castle
my
dear
he
made
an
apologetic
little
bow
to
ozma
and
then
continued
seriously
a
danger
from
without
threatens
the
kingdom
of
oz
who
would
dare
threaten
the
sovereignty
of
our
country
demanded
the
yellow
knight
brandishing
his
sword
what
up
what
up
neighed
highboy
elevating
himself
so
suddenly
he
cracked
his
head
against
the
ceiling
you
should
know
being
so
high
chuckled
the
scarecrow
who
could
not
resist
a
joke
even
when
he
was
most
serious
but
calm
yourself
my
good
horse
you
are
not
in
danger
yet
danger
the
short
ugly
word
dropped
like
a
bomb
into
that
gay
and
carefree
assemblage
dorothy
with
a
little
pang
of
dismay
saw
the
cowardly
lion
creeping
under
the
table
and
feeling
in
her
pocket
for
her
handkerchief
drew
out
instead
one
of
the
wizard
wishing
pills
he
had
given
it
to
her
so
she
could
visit
the
corn
ear
palace
of
the
scarecrow
the
following
week
and
do
it
by
simply
wishing
herself
there
instead
of
making
the
journey
dorothy
fingered
the
pill
thoughtfully
for
a
minute
or
two
then
with
a
sudden
quick
motion
popped
the
small
tablet
into
her
mouth
whatever
happens
help
me
to
save
ozma
and
oz
murmured
dorothy
and
swallowing
the
pill
she
looked
sharply
around
the
room
for
further
signs
of
warning
or
disaster
chapter
what
wizard
at
first
everything
seemed
as
usual
then
turning
to
ask
the
tin
woodman
a
question
dorothy
was
annoyed
to
discover
that
his
chair
was
pushed
back
and
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
oh
he
probably
helping
the
wizard
decided
dorothy
and
had
no
sooner
come
to
this
comforting
conclusion
before
she
gave
a
second
start
of
alarm
glinda
the
good
sorceress
was
no
longer
in
her
seat
at
the
foot
of
the
table
and
running
her
eye
hurriedly
down
the
glittering
board
dorothy
saw
five
more
empty
places
pressing
a
finger
to
her
forehead
dorothy
tried
to
remember
who
had
been
sitting
in
the
five
deserted
chairs
surely
joe
king
and
queen
hyacinth
had
been
there
between
bettsy
bobbin
and
trot
while
prince
philador
queen
orin
and
king
cheeriobed
had
been
directly
opposite
good
gillikens
gasped
the
little
girl
jumping
quickly
to
her
feet
the
rulers
of
all
four
oz
countries
are
gone
and
highboy
gone
too
and
strangely
enough
nobody
seemed
to
have
missed
them
instead
they
were
listening
with
broad
smiles
and
appreciatively
tapping
toes
to
the
loud
and
hilarious
singing
of
the
patch
work
girl
scraps
thinking
it
a
shame
to
let
a
mere
change
of
whiskers
spoil
a
good
party
was
enlivening
the
company
with
her
newest
and
most
comical
rhymes
so
loud
was
her
voice
and
the
applause
of
the
banqueters
dorothy
found
it
impossible
to
make
herself
heard
so
running
around
to
the
back
of
the
scarecrow
chair
she
tugged
him
anxiously
by
the
arm
scarecrow
scarecrow
whispered
dorothy
hoarsely
where
are
the
four
rulers
of
oz
and
whatever
can
be
keeping
the
wizard
so
long
tearing
his
gaze
reluctantly
from
the
patch
work
girl
the
scarecrow
looked
dreamily
over
his
shoulder
what
wizard
he
inquired
blankly
the
wizard
our
wizard
the
wonderful
wizard
of
oz
dorothy
stamped
her
foot
and
almost
shouted
with
surprise
and
vexation
never
heard
of
him
declared
the
scarecrow
smiling
blandly
down
at
her
now
why
not
sit
quietly
down
and
listen
to
scraps
she
never
been
funnier
ha
ha
ha
never
funnier
dorothy
was
so
stunned
and
dumbfounded
by
the
scarecrow
statement
about
the
wizard
she
opened
and
closed
her
mouth
several
times
without
saying
anything
mercy
i
better
tell
ozma
about
this
she
thought
distractedly
and
swinging
round
abruptly
she
scurried
along
back
of
the
diners
till
she
came
to
the
head
of
the
table
oh
ozma
panted
the
little
girl
breathlessly
then
stopped
short
there
was
no
one
in
ozma
great
dragon
armed
chair
of
state
the
yellow
knight
and
prince
pompadore
who
for
the
last
course
were
in
the
seats
of
honor
beside
the
little
queen
leaned
unconcernedly
across
her
empty
place
engaged
in
a
long
earnest
argument
about
horses
they
looked
up
in
surprise
as
dorothy
her
crown
by
this
time
very
much
on
the
side
bounced
suddenly
between
them
where
ozma
demanded
the
little
girl
thumping
her
fist
sharply
on
the
table
ozma
the
yellow
knight
and
prince
pompa
exchanged
an
uneasy
glance
who
is
ozma
asked
prince
pompadore
curiously
oh
oh
i
think
you
all
are
perfectly
horrid
stop
joking
stop
teasing
me
cried
dorothy
and
as
both
princes
in
frank
amazement
jumped
up
to
try
to
comfort
her
she
rushed
angrily
from
the
room
as
she
fled
along
the
green
corridor
she
could
still
hear
scraps
singing
and
the
shouts
and
cheers
of
her
listeners
this
is
terrible
terrible
wailed
dorothy
and
running
blindly
down
the
long
hall
she
burst
through
the
swinging
doors
of
the
wizard
laboratory
what
she
had
expected
to
find
dorothy
hardly
knew
really
she
was
hoping
to
see
ozma
and
the
four
other
rulers
grouped
around
the
wizard
green
table
but
only
a
blank
suffocating
silence
answered
her
frantic
call
for
the
wizard
frightened
into
silence
herself
dorothy
tiptoed
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
long
curiously
appointed
apartment
peering
into
cupboards
under
sofas
and
back
of
screens
where
was
the
red
jinn
where
was
the
little
wizard
of
oz
not
here
certainly
not
in
the
banquet
hall
but
the
throne
room
there
she
would
find
all
of
her
missing
friends
conferring
with
ozma
over
the
threatened
danger
to
the
realm
with
a
little
gasp
of
relief
she
darted
across
the
corridor
into
the
vast
and
magnificent
hall
of
justice
where
ozma
received
visitors
settled
disputes
and
carried
on
all
the
important
business
of
governing
they
were
not
in
the
sumptuous
presence
chamber
but
at
least
the
throne
was
not
empty
no
no
indeed
dorothy
looked
once
rubbed
her
eyes
looked
again
and
then
giving
a
shrill
scream
of
terror
flung
both
arms
round
one
of
the
emerald
studded
pillars
an
immense
white
horse
was
sitting
on
the
throne
of
oz
a
great
fat
king
was
sitting
on
the
horse
or
rather
clinging
desperately
to
his
neck
dorothy
knew
he
was
a
king
by
the
crown
perched
ridiculously
on
the
side
of
his
head
that
crown
seemed
oddly
familiar
and
after
another
horrified
glance
dorothy
screamed
again
for
it
was
the
splendid
emerald
circlet
belonging
to
ozma
of
oz
her
screams
seemed
to
rouse
the
two
occupants
of
the
throne
who
to
be
perfectly
frank
looked
as
dazed
and
stupefied
as
dorothy
herself
go
away
sputtered
the
fat
king
waving
his
arms
irritably
go
away
little
girl
and
do
bother
me
and
kindly
bow
as
you
leave
directed
the
white
horse
lifting
one
foot
sternly
you
are
looking
at
the
emperor
of
oz
and
his
imperial
charger
bowing
more
from
astonishment
than
intention
dorothy
backed
a
few
steps
then
turned
round
and
ran
madly
toward
the
royal
banquet
hall
chapter
way
for
the
emperor
here
give
her
water
give
her
air
stand
back
everybody
now
then
what
the
matter
child
the
scarecrow
bent
solicitously
over
the
little
girl
who
had
rushed
into
the
banquet
hall
screaming
hysterically
about
disappearances
and
white
horses
and
fallen
breathlessly
into
the
chair
beside
him
come
tell
uncle
all
about
it
begged
the
scarecrow
patting
dorothy
clumsily
on
the
head
tell
you
choked
poor
dorothy
twisting
her
best
handkerchief
into
a
hard
knot
do
i
have
to
tell
you
ca
you
see
for
yourselves
that
ozma
is
missing
that
the
wizard
and
jinnicky
are
gone
that
glinda
and
the
tin
woodman
that
the
king
and
queen
of
the
gillikens
and
the
king
and
queen
of
the
munchkins
have
vanished
entirely
and
yet
here
you
sit
singing
and
laughing
as
if
nothing
at
all
had
happened
ca
you
understand
that
something
dreadful
has
happened
to
ozma
and
that
a
big
fat
man
and
a
white
horse
are
sitting
on
the
throne
of
oz
ozma
ozma
who
she
murmured
the
banqueters
looking
vaguely
at
dorothy
and
then
at
each
other
she
feverish
that
what
herby
the
medicine
man
leaned
over
to
touch
dorothy
expertly
on
the
forehead
i
advise
you
to
go
upstairs
and
lie
down
my
dear
yes
why
do
you
urged
bettsy
bobbin
coming
over
to
put
her
arm
around
dorothy
waist
i
go
up
with
you
and
lend
you
my
very
best
smelling
salts
lie
down
with
that
big
fat
interloper
on
the
throne
of
oz
wailed
dorothy
squirming
out
of
bettsy
embrace
she
started
indignantly
to
her
feet
you
must
be
crazy
camy
kabumpo
snufferbux
toto
you
you
believe
me
wo
you
hurrying
over
to
the
second
table
dorothy
looked
pleadingly
down
the
long
board
from
the
hungry
tiger
at
the
head
to
the
cowardly
lion
at
the
foot
there
there
mumbled
kabumpo
lifting
dorothy
up
in
his
trunk
do
go
on
so
my
dear
we
all
have
these
little
funny
spells
here
sit
up
on
my
back
so
you
have
a
good
view
of
the
emperor
when
he
arrives
hi
there
he
comes
now
ray
ray
way
for
skamperoo
emperor
of
oz
waving
dorothy
in
his
trunk
as
if
she
had
been
a
flag
kabumpo
plopped
down
on
his
knees
and
banged
his
big
head
three
times
on
the
polished
floor
from
her
precarious
position
dorothy
saw
the
same
fat
imposter
who
had
been
in
the
throne
room
riding
his
white
charger
pompously
into
the
banquet
hall
the
horse
nodding
to
the
left
and
right
and
grinning
like
a
cheshire
cat
cheers
bows
and
a
loud
burst
of
applause
and
music
made
his
entry
so
noisy
dorothy
angry
protests
and
cries
were
entirely
drowned
out
disgusted
confused
and
completely
bewildered
by
the
behavior
of
subjects
and
her
own
best
friends
dorothy
jerked
away
from
kabumpo
and
darted
through
a
long
french
window
into
the
garden
what
could
it
mean
what
could
have
happened
had
all
her
former
memories
of
oz
been
a
dream
no
no
violently
dorothy
decided
against
such
an
idea
rather
was
this
fat
emperor
a
dream
a
maddening
nightmare
from
which
she
would
presently
awaken
leaning
dizzily
against
a
golden
faun
set
near
a
crystal
garden
pool
dorothy
tried
to
find
some
reasonable
explanation
of
the
whole
dreadful
mixup
and
here
several
minutes
later
pigasus
the
winged
pig
found
her
thought
a
little
fly
over
the
tree
tops
might
help
your
head
grunted
pigasus
looking
unhappily
down
his
pink
snout
nothing
like
a
little
fly
for
a
headache
my
girl
my
head
all
right
answered
dorothy
sullenly
it
the
rest
of
you
who
have
lost
your
heads
or
your
senses
how
in
oz
you
could
stand
in
there
cheering
that
big
fat
fraud
i
never
never
understand
piggins
piggins
dear
dorothy
bent
coaxingly
over
him
surely
you
remember
ozma
and
the
wizard
and
glinda
instead
of
answering
at
once
pigasus
stared
thoughtfully
at
his
reflection
in
the
pool
suppose
you
sit
on
my
back
and
then
we
can
talk
without
being
heard
he
suggested
brightly
up
in
the
air
we
can
air
our
views
in
safety
as
it
were
to
tell
the
truth
i
do
much
care
where
i
go
now
sighed
dorothy
seating
herself
disconsolately
on
the
pig
broad
back
hey
hey
we
bewitched
and
enchanted
i
knew
it
with
you
on
my
back
i
can
think
and
see
through
it
squealed
pigasus
and
flapping
his
huge
wings
he
soared
high
over
the
flowering
plum
trees
in
ozma
garden
of
course
ozma
queen
not
this
big
skamperoo
the
ruler
of
oz
and
the
whole
royal
crew
have
been
kidnapped
bewitched
or
put
out
of
the
way
we
fly
off
for
help
and
we
start
right
away
oh
piggins
dorothy
threw
both
arms
round
the
pig
neck
and
almost
wept
for
joy
oh
pigasus
to
think
you
remember
them
too
but
where
have
they
gone
what
in
oz
shall
we
do
we
find
them
wherever
they
are
they
be
found
but
we
best
make
our
plans
with
our
feet
on
the
ground
muttered
pigasus
looking
below
for
a
likely
spot
to
land
there
was
one
disadvantage
about
pigasus
though
some
did
not
regard
it
as
such
like
the
winged
horse
pegasus
whoever
caught
him
and
rode
on
his
back
at
once
became
a
poet
and
unable
to
speak
anything
but
rhymes
the
poetic
pig
could
not
only
tell
what
they
were
thinking
but
he
often
spoke
his
own
mind
in
verse
as
well
at
times
this
grew
terribly
tiresome
but
except
for
his
jingles
a
more
cheerful
loyal
little
fellow
could
not
be
found
in
the
length
or
breadth
of
the
country
raised
and
bred
by
the
red
jinn
he
had
been
given
to
the
duke
of
dork
the
duke
had
given
him
to
the
philadelphia
boy
peter
who
in
the
course
of
a
voyage
with
samuel
salt
the
pirate
had
captured
the
duke
splendid
castle
boat
the
capture
had
been
quite
a
social
and
friendly
affair
and
the
duke
had
traded
pigasus
for
a
bananny
goat
peter
had
later
brought
the
flying
pig
to
the
emerald
city
where
he
was
petted
and
admired
by
the
whole
court
now
slanting
down
into
a
quiet
grove
pigasus
came
to
a
gentle
stop
and
dorothy
tumbled
jubilantly
off
his
back
oh
pigasus
is
it
lucky
you
were
in
the
emerald
city
nobody
else
can
remember
ozma
or
the
others
at
all
and
i
only
remembered
them
because
you
sat
on
my
back
confessed
the
pig
twitching
his
nose
thoughtfully
it
was
my
gift
that
did
the
trick
and
i
am
more
than
ever
convinced
that
we
are
under
some
mischievous
spell
or
enchantment
what
i
do
understand
my
dear
is
how
you
yourself
escaped
or
chanced
to
remember
things
as
they
were
you
know
before
i
came
out
here
it
seemed
perfectly
right
and
natural
for
that
roly
poly
pudding
of
an
emperor
to
be
sitting
at
the
head
of
the
table
i
knew
no
more
about
ozma
or
glinda
or
my
former
master
jinnicky
than
a
baby
by
the
way
gone
too
is
he
yes
dorothy
shook
her
head
sorrowfully
and
without
him
or
the
wizard
to
help
we
have
a
hard
time
i
guess
what
shall
we
do
first
piggins
how
about
having
a
try
at
some
of
the
wizard
magic
proposed
the
pink
pig
daringly
then
we
might
look
in
ozma
magic
picture
and
ask
it
to
show
us
where
all
of
our
missing
friends
are
now
now
why
did
i
think
of
that
myself
cried
dorothy
and
springing
up
she
started
off
on
a
run
wait
wait
grunted
pigasus
pattering
breathlessly
after
her
remember
we
must
be
very
careful
my
dear
no
questions
about
ozma
no
remarks
that
will
arouse
the
anger
of
this
scalawag
emperor
or
we
both
be
clapped
in
a
dungeon
we
must
pretend
that
we
have
forgotten
too
and
get
away
quietly
later
tonight
this
seemed
so
sensible
a
plan
dorothy
readily
agreed
to
it
and
without
attracting
any
attention
at
all
they
the
palace
and
hurried
immediately
to
ozma
small
sitting
room
but
if
they
expected
the
magic
picture
to
solve
their
problem
they
were
soon
doomed
to
disappointment
the
picture
was
gone
from
its
accustomed
place
and
the
safe
where
ozma
kept
her
magic
treasures
and
other
valuables
was
wide
open
and
quite
empty
a
quick
search
of
the
wizard
laboratory
proved
equally
discouraging
the
wizard
famous
black
bag
was
nowhere
in
sight
the
little
hanging
closet
where
he
stored
his
transformation
powders
and
wishing
pills
was
bare
as
the
cupboard
of
old
mother
hubbard
whoever
planned
this
thought
of
everything
wheezed
pigasus
sitting
heavily
back
on
his
haunches
there
is
nothing
here
for
us
dorothy
if
i
were
you
i
get
a
few
things
together
and
we
leave
right
away
before
anyone
misses
you
from
the
cheers
shouts
and
hilarious
singing
coming
from
the
banquet
hall
it
seemed
probable
that
the
celebration
would
go
on
for
hours
no
one
in
that
gay
and
foolish
company
even
thought
of
or
missed
the
little
girl
and
the
pink
pig
stealing
so
quietly
through
the
dim
halls
of
the
palace
ozma
palace
reflected
dorothy
looking
resentfully
over
her
shoulder
but
now
it
seemed
strange
alien
and
completely
unfriendly
with
a
little
shiver
dorothy
drew
her
cloak
more
closely
about
her
and
stepped
resolutely
out
into
the
night
pigasus
pattered
on
ahead
snorting
a
bit
from
sheer
nervousness
maybe
we
better
fly
he
grunted
uneasily
as
dorothy
caught
up
with
him
it
safer
and
it
faster
and
the
faster
we
get
away
from
here
the
better
i
thinking
i
been
thinking
too
answered
dorothy
in
a
low
voice
perhaps
only
the
people
in
the
emerald
city
are
under
this
forgetting
spell
pigasus
perhaps
if
we
fly
to
the
winkie
country
the
winkies
will
remember
their
emperor
the
tin
woodman
and
will
help
us
raise
an
army
so
we
can
come
back
conquer
this
old
skamperoo
and
make
him
tell
where
he
has
hidden
all
the
proper
rulers
of
oz
and
the
other
celebrities
that
the
talk
that
the
talk
approved
the
pig
twinkling
his
little
blue
eyes
joyfully
up
with
you
up
with
you
my
girl
but
remember
if
you
grow
sleepy
let
me
know
at
once
so
i
can
descend
if
you
fall
asleep
you
might
fall
off
my
back
and
think
how
i
feel
then
think
how
feel
laughed
dorothy
her
spirits
lifting
a
bit
at
the
pink
pig
comical
conversation
and
enthusiastic
seconding
of
her
plans
seating
herself
carefully
on
his
plump
back
she
quickly
gave
the
signal
to
start
then
up
soared
pigasus
over
the
palace
garden
over
the
city
walls
and
away
toward
the
east
and
the
yellow
lands
of
the
winkies
oh
i
believe
everything
is
going
to
be
all
right
thought
dorothy
settling
herself
cozily
between
his
wings
so
do
i
sniffed
the
pink
pig
peering
mischievously
over
his
shoulder
i
forgot
you
could
read
all
the
thoughts
goodness
gracious
of
those
on
your
back
do
you
mind
it
pigasus
not
when
they
nice
thoughts
like
yours
puffed
the
little
pig
in
answer
to
dorothy
surprised
rhyme
and
winking
his
eye
jovially
he
zoomed
like
a
small
pink
zeppelin
through
the
sky
chapter
the
journey
begins
for
several
hours
pigasus
flew
without
slackening
his
pace
then
as
several
suspicious
little
yawns
and
sighs
floated
past
his
keen
upstanding
ears
he
solemnly
slanted
downward
if
he
had
chosen
it
on
purpose
he
could
not
have
found
a
more
comfortable
place
for
dorothy
to
spend
the
night
they
had
already
crossed
the
border
and
penetrated
far
into
the
land
of
the
winkies
and
were
now
landing
in
the
quiet
garden
of
a
prosperous
winkie
farmer
set
in
the
center
of
a
dancing
bed
of
yellow
daffodils
and
tulips
stood
a
small
summer
house
and
with
dorothy
rubbing
her
eyes
sleepily
pigasus
trotted
briskly
into
the
rustic
cottage
the
door
was
invitingly
open
and
the
moon
lit
up
its
cozy
interior
snorting
with
satisfaction
pigasus
pattered
over
to
a
broad
couch
piled
high
with
yellow
cushions
and
rolling
drowsily
from
his
back
dorothy
burrowed
contentedly
into
the
center
of
them
falling
asleep
before
the
pig
reached
his
own
bed
a
soft
woolly
rug
on
the
hearth
pigasus
slept
lightly
but
well
and
waking
around
six
began
to
gaze
rather
anxiously
at
the
round
yellow
farm
buildings
just
visible
from
the
door
the
pink
pig
had
had
several
unfortunate
experiences
with
farmers
they
had
a
way
of
looking
at
his
plump
body
that
seemed
to
reduce
him
at
once
to
slices
of
bacon
and
sides
of
ham
one
enterprising
fellow
had
actually
caught
him
and
shut
him
up
in
an
untidy
pen
from
this
foolish
prison
pigasus
had
escaped
by
spreading
his
wings
and
flying
away
but
the
mere
mention
of
farmer
gave
him
the
shivers
so
now
moving
impatiently
about
the
little
room
he
waited
for
dorothy
to
awaken
and
as
she
continued
to
slumber
on
he
flew
up
over
the
mantel
and
swept
a
large
yellow
jug
to
the
floor
with
his
wing
the
crash
of
the
falling
jar
aroused
dorothy
at
once
and
without
stopping
to
explain
pigasus
suggested
that
they
start
off
and
dorothy
not
even
noticing
the
broken
jug
readily
consented
we
probably
find
a
much
better
place
to
have
breakfast
as
we
fly
along
murmured
pigasus
as
dorothy
seated
herself
between
his
wings
holding
her
small
basket
of
supplies
in
her
lap
would
it
do
any
harm
to
stop
at
the
farm
and
enquire
about
ozma
and
spread
the
alarm
asked
dorothy
who
had
rather
counted
on
a
cheerful
breakfast
at
the
farm
house
no
it
would
do
any
harm
answered
pigasus
rising
in
a
straight
line
from
the
tulip
bed
and
winging
rapidly
over
the
yellow
fields
and
fences
but
neither
would
it
do
any
good
farmers
never
know
happening
or
going
to
happen
i
tell
you
though
we
ask
the
first
person
we
meet
who
would
we
meet
in
the
air
but
a
bird
now
really
pigasus
that
simply
absurd
some
of
the
smartest
people
i
know
are
birds
insisted
the
pig
stoutly
take
roger
for
instance
he
knows
more
than
most
of
us
have
forgotten
but
look
a
brook
a
quiet
wood
stop
listen
look
for
i
crave
food
making
a
swift
downward
curve
pigasus
landed
cleverly
by
a
rippling
stream
edged
by
some
tall
butternut
trees
there
were
yellow
raspberries
along
the
bank
and
the
berries
with
some
of
the
sandwiches
dorothy
had
brought
with
her
washed
down
by
cool
water
from
the
brook
made
a
splendid
breakfast
i
wonder
whether
they
have
the
tableaux
and
pageant
without
me
sighed
dorothy
biting
slowly
into
a
sardine
sandwich
and
how
they
manage
the
circus
without
you
piggins
or
the
picnic
supper
without
ozma
or
the
magic
and
fireworks
without
the
wizard
they
probably
forgotten
all
about
today
doings
mumbled
pigasus
nosing
busily
among
the
leaves
for
ripe
butternuts
they
probably
spend
the
time
bumping
their
noses
on
the
floor
when
that
fat
emperor
comes
waddling
through
the
palace
and
bending
the
right
knee
every
time
his
white
horse
sneezes
or
coughs
pah
choking
with
indignation
pigasus
began
gobbling
up
so
many
butternuts
dorothy
feared
he
would
never
be
able
to
fly
or
walk
again
let
stay
on
the
ground
for
awhile
she
proposed
eyeing
him
rather
nervously
as
she
packed
the
remaining
sandwiches
neatly
back
in
the
basket
i
believe
there
a
path
beyond
those
trees
maybe
it
leads
to
a
town
or
village
where
we
may
meet
someone
who
can
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
you
do
expect
to
find
out
where
ozma
and
the
others
are
hidden
straight
off
do
you
rubbing
his
back
lazily
against
one
of
the
butternut
trees
pigasus
looked
quizzically
at
his
earnest
little
companion
no
i
do
really
expect
that
said
dorothy
slipping
the
basket
over
her
arm
but
it
would
be
pretty
nice
if
we
met
somebody
who
even
remembered
them
after
all
we
been
through
i
can
hardly
remember
them
myself
unless
you
are
sitting
on
my
back
admitted
the
pink
pig
trotting
soberly
along
at
her
side
this
emperor
magic
must
be
strong
medicine
hello
here
comes
a
fisherman
pigasus
pricked
up
both
ears
and
his
wings
shall
i
question
him
or
will
you
without
bothering
to
answer
dorothy
ran
eagerly
toward
the
tall
winkie
who
was
coming
leisurely
along
the
path
he
carried
a
basket
and
had
a
fishing
rod
over
his
shoulder
and
though
his
clothes
were
rough
dorothy
could
tell
by
his
manner
and
bearing
that
he
was
a
person
of
some
importance
oh
please
winkie
cried
the
little
girl
as
he
nodded
politely
and
would
have
passed
them
without
stopping
could
you
tell
us
who
is
king
here
king
answered
the
fisherman
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
looking
kindly
down
at
his
small
questioner
why
no
one
in
particular
my
dear
but
of
course
we
winkies
and
the
inhabitants
of
the
three
other
countries
of
oz
are
governed
from
the
capital
by
emperor
skamperoo
a
great
fellow
our
emp
and
have
you
seen
his
white
horse
yes
i
seen
it
said
dorothy
shutting
her
mouth
rather
grimly
but
i
thought
ozma
was
queen
wheezed
pigasus
out
of
breath
from
running
after
dorothy
and
too
many
butternuts
ozma
what
a
curious
name
mused
the
fisherman
looking
pensively
at
the
winged
pig
what
gave
you
the
idea
that
ozma
was
our
ruler
perhaps
you
are
strangers
here
well
it
would
seem
so
puffed
pigasus
sitting
down
and
panting
a
little
from
sheer
discouragement
oh
you
get
used
to
us
laughed
the
fisherman
with
a
breezy
wave
fine
country
this
sorry
i
ca
show
you
but
as
promised
my
wife
some
fish
for
dinner
i
have
to
be
moving
along
good
day
to
you
good
day
little
girl
good
day
echoed
dorothy
in
a
rather
flat
voice
as
the
fisherman
lifting
his
hat
strode
briskly
into
the
wood
you
see
she
groaned
even
here
everyone
is
bewitched
oh
piggins
what
we
do
no
one
in
oz
will
help
or
believe
us
and
turnips
what
if
they
do
pigasus
shook
his
head
impatiently
there
are
other
countries
are
there
take
ev
for
instance
or
rinkitink
or
the
rose
kingdom
why
there
are
lots
of
places
whose
rulers
will
remember
ozma
my
poor
old
friend
jinnicky
and
the
others
come
along
my
girl
we
only
just
started
while
people
roar
for
the
emperor
we
seek
our
rightful
ruler
from
coast
to
coast
from
door
to
door
though
foes
grow
cruel
and
crueller
what
we
need
is
some
magic
finished
pigasus
shrewdly
know
a
good
place
to
look
for
some
the
gnome
king
has
plenty
of
magic
reflected
dorothy
leaning
thoughtfully
against
a
tree
and
ozma
and
i
really
helped
put
him
on
the
throne
so
surely
he
help
us
well
maybe
but
i
do
set
great
store
by
gnomes
they
tricky
nevertheless
we
go
to
ev
and
everywhere
else
till
we
restore
this
country
to
its
proper
rulers
pigasus
looked
so
impressive
with
his
chest
and
cheeks
puffed
out
with
purpose
dorothy
gave
him
a
quick
hug
down
with
the
emperor
snorted
pigasus
though
almost
suffocated
by
dorothy
embrace
and
up
with
you
my
patriotic
young
princess
now
you
make
me
feel
like
a
real
one
i
almost
forgotten
i
was
a
princess
smiled
dorothy
climbing
obediently
on
his
back
i
believe
everything
will
be
better
from
now
on
well
it
could
be
a
lot
worse
chuckled
pigasus
and
flapping
his
wings
in
a
manner
he
rose
gracefully
into
the
air
and
headed
for
the
east
rolling
hills
dotted
with
castles
villages
and
towns
valleys
farm
lands
and
forests
flashed
in
an
pleasant
panorama
below
at
noon
they
came
down
beside
the
winkie
river
finished
up
the
rest
of
the
sandwiches
for
lunch
and
then
looked
eagerly
around
for
someone
else
to
question
but
the
ferryman
who
presently
came
into
sight
poling
his
raft
across
the
turbulent
river
knew
no
more
of
ozma
and
the
other
rulers
of
oz
than
the
fisherman
but
he
told
them
many
long
and
boring
stories
of
skamperoo
and
his
white
horse
chalk
dorothy
and
pigasus
had
to
make
such
an
effort
to
listen
politely
they
were
relieved
when
he
finally
shoved
off
and
began
poling
himself
back
to
the
other
side
have
you
any
idea
how
far
we
come
asked
pigasus
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
cool
grass
as
dorothy
made
a
face
at
the
ferryman
back
yes
said
dorothy
dropping
full
length
beside
him
this
river
is
in
about
the
center
of
the
winkie
kingdom
so
we
are
easily
half
way
we
could
reach
the
deadly
desert
by
night
fly
over
tomorrow
morning
and
either
go
north
to
ev
or
stop
at
the
underground
castle
of
the
gnome
king
even
if
kalico
wo
lend
us
his
army
he
might
lend
us
some
magic
speaking
of
armies
they
must
have
whisked
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
off
with
the
others
i
do
remember
seeing
him
after
he
left
the
banquet
hall
do
you
which
just
goes
to
show
this
skamperoo
must
be
a
stranger
in
oz
for
who
else
would
have
been
afraid
of
our
precious
old
army
why
he
would
even
tread
on
a
caterpillar
by
the
way
has
kalico
any
magic
that
might
tell
us
where
to
look
for
our
vanished
friends
and
rulers
i
not
sure
of
that
dorothy
told
him
dubiously
but
he
has
a
wizard
and
ruggedo
who
was
king
before
kalico
had
many
magic
treasures
and
powers
he
could
make
floors
and
walls
spin
round
and
round
open
yawning
caverns
at
your
feet
or
drop
rocks
down
on
your
head
without
even
moving
sounds
lovely
sniffed
pigasus
coming
to
his
feet
with
a
short
grunt
say
have
we
trouble
enough
at
home
without
going
to
look
for
it
do
you
really
propose
to
visit
this
tricky
little
metal
monarch
but
kalico
is
not
nearly
so
bad
as
ruggedo
dorothy
sat
up
and
smoothed
her
dress
earnestly
well
just
as
you
wish
pigasus
shrugged
his
wings
with
me
people
are
like
eggs
either
good
or
bad
there
no
such
thing
as
a
nearly
good
egg
it
got
to
be
completely
good
or
it
just
as
bad
as
a
bad
egg
d
see
and
if
this
gnome
king
is
only
as
good
as
a
nearly
fresh
egg
i
would
trust
him
with
my
second
best
tooth
brush
my
idea
would
be
to
go
to
the
ruler
of
ev
that
evardo
a
boy
king
ozma
helped
him
too
dorothy
explained
importantly
but
i
tell
you
piggins
let
not
decide
till
we
cross
the
deadly
desert
something
might
turn
up
before
then
you
never
can
tell
no
agreed
the
pig
shaking
his
head
sagely
in
oz
you
never
can
suppose
we
continue
a
ways
on
foot
my
wings
are
a
bit
stiff
and
we
really
should
be
on
the
lookout
for
a
friendly
house
or
castle
where
we
could
have
supper
and
spend
the
night
i
could
eat
a
peck
of
spinach
or
a
bushel
of
apples
right
now
so
hop
up
my
dear
and
i
stretch
a
leg
for
the
good
of
the
coz
and
oz
chattering
away
like
the
good
fellow
he
was
pigasus
trotted
briskly
across
the
fields
and
presently
came
to
a
deep
rustling
forest
shall
we
fly
over
or
walk
through
questioned
the
pig
sniffing
appreciatively
the
cool
air
drifting
out
to
them
let
go
through
it
in
a
wood
there
might
be
witches
some
are
good
a
good
witch
with
her
magic
powers
could
solve
this
mystery
of
ours
but
suppose
we
meet
a
bad
one
muttered
pigasus
stepping
gingerly
into
the
forest
and
picking
his
way
with
great
care
between
the
giant
trees
then
we
say
goodbye
and
simply
fly
laughed
dorothy
snapping
her
fingers
joyfully
yes
but
flying
would
not
be
so
easy
in
here
objected
pigasus
with
a
troubled
glance
aloft
these
branches
are
interlocked
so
closely
stick
in
a
tree
like
a
kite
oh
we
probably
wo
meet
anyone
said
dorothy
slipping
off
his
back
she
walked
along
beside
him
one
arm
flung
cozily
around
his
neck
she
was
rather
tired
of
making
verses
and
thought
she
could
think
better
if
her
head
were
not
continually
buzzing
with
rhymes
after
the
hot
sunny
meadows
the
cool
shade
of
the
forest
was
very
welcome
but
as
they
advanced
farther
and
farther
into
the
shadows
it
grew
so
dark
and
grim
the
two
began
to
look
at
each
other
in
real
alarm
must
be
a
squall
or
thunder
shower
brewing
observed
pigasus
in
a
faint
voice
yes
it
could
be
night
time
so
soon
agreed
dorothy
looking
fearfully
over
her
shoulder
the
crackling
of
twigs
as
some
large
animal
made
its
way
through
the
brush
sounded
like
gun
fire
and
while
they
were
trying
to
make
up
their
minds
whether
to
run
back
or
push
forward
a
long
hollow
roar
sent
them
scittering
forward
practically
as
one
missing
trees
by
mere
inches
they
pelted
at
breakneck
speed
into
the
dense
and
even
gloomier
stretch
of
woodland
ahead
climb
on
my
back
directed
pigasus
halting
at
last
from
lack
of
breath
rather
than
inclination
but
where
are
you
i
ca
even
see
you
wailed
dorothy
feeling
about
wildly
here
here
grunted
the
frantic
pig
making
short
dashes
in
four
or
five
directions
and
finally
bumping
violently
into
the
groping
little
girl
snatching
at
a
wing
dorothy
pulled
herself
thankfully
up
and
clasped
both
arms
round
his
neck
in
a
tense
and
breathless
silence
they
waited
for
it
to
grow
lighter
they
could
not
see
even
an
inch
before
their
noses
now
and
the
darkness
and
silence
grew
more
oppressive
and
unbearable
every
minute
j
a
cloud
passing
over
croaked
pigasus
trying
to
keep
his
teeth
from
chattering
say
what
that
dorothy
do
you
hear
anything
f
not
four
two
someone
coming
hello
there
who
are
you
watch
out
now
we
here
i
see
you
answered
a
flat
voice
oh
he
sees
us
yet
we
ca
see
him
i
frightened
deaf
and
dumb
oh
try
to
fly
pigasus
why
oh
why
we
ever
come
that
what
i
like
to
know
went
on
the
voice
sternly
now
then
will
you
come
quietly
or
must
i
drag
you
along
chapter
the
witch
of
the
black
forest
dorothy
and
her
companion
were
too
stunned
to
answer
and
in
two
thumping
steps
the
owner
of
the
voice
was
upon
them
do
you
dare
to
defy
a
member
of
the
invincible
black
watch
breathed
the
stranger
grasping
pigasus
roughly
by
the
right
wing
no
no
we
do
exactly
defy
you
squealed
the
pig
flapping
his
other
wing
frantically
but
how
can
we
follow
a
blackguard
whom
we
can
not
even
see
then
how
do
you
know
i
am
a
blackguard
demanded
their
captor
suspiciously
from
your
voice
screamed
pigasus
jerking
this
way
and
that
way
in
an
effort
to
free
himself
i
know
you
for
a
blackguard
anywhere
unhand
me
you
surly
black
monster
you
talk
a
lot
for
a
fellow
who
can
not
see
scoffed
the
guard
tightening
his
grip
on
the
pig
wing
is
the
girl
blind
too
we
not
blind
at
all
and
why
should
we
be
in
this
horrid
black
forest
how
could
we
see
cried
dorothy
her
indignation
getting
the
better
of
her
fright
well
what
color
are
your
eyes
dorothy
felt
the
hot
breath
of
the
guardsman
on
her
neck
as
he
leaned
over
to
find
out
for
himself
blue
he
murmured
in
evident
puzzlement
and
the
pig
eyes
are
blue
too
so
the
reason
what
has
the
color
to
do
with
it
grunted
pigasus
growing
a
little
calmer
as
the
conversation
progressed
without
either
of
them
coming
to
actual
harm
everything
explained
the
guard
impressively
in
the
black
forest
one
must
have
black
eyes
to
see
see
even
a
pig
should
know
that
well
i
suppose
i
could
run
into
a
tree
and
black
my
eyes
sniffed
pigasus
bitterly
but
thank
you
no
i
prefer
blue
eyes
and
now
if
you
will
kindly
conduct
us
to
the
edge
of
this
deep
dark
dangerous
and
disgusting
domain
we
be
delighted
to
go
leave
depart
and
bid
you
farewell
forever
oh
keep
all
that
for
gloma
drawled
the
guard
indifferently
i
a
plain
man
and
prefer
plain
language
furthermore
no
one
leaves
this
forest
unless
they
break
the
black
laws
if
you
break
the
law
you
are
cast
out
into
the
utter
and
awful
light
of
eternal
day
now
then
come
along
and
giving
the
pig
wing
a
cruel
tweak
he
tramped
doggedly
forward
pigasus
to
save
his
precious
feathers
was
obliged
to
come
suiting
his
gait
to
the
guard
strides
the
best
thing
for
us
to
do
is
to
break
the
law
at
once
he
whispered
mournfully
to
dorothy
as
he
blinked
about
in
a
desperate
effort
to
penetrate
the
gloom
dorothy
was
too
depressed
to
answer
and
after
clearing
his
throat
several
times
the
blackguard
began
to
question
pigasus
why
the
wings
he
asked
inquiringly
i
seen
many
a
farmyard
creature
in
my
day
but
never
a
pig
with
wings
are
you
a
pig
or
a
kind
of
balony
bird
what
right
has
a
pig
to
wings
let
go
and
i
show
you
puffed
pigasus
hoping
the
curiosity
would
cause
him
to
loosen
his
hold
but
the
guard
only
laughed
at
such
an
idea
let
you
go
i
should
say
not
he
exclaimed
with
a
little
chuckle
you
can
show
all
your
little
tricks
to
gloma
and
she
can
decide
whether
to
ride
or
roast
you
this
girl
on
your
back
will
make
a
splendid
slave
slave
shrilled
pigasus
stumbling
angrily
along
in
the
dark
have
you
know
that
she
is
a
princess
of
oz
and
lives
in
the
palace
of
ozma
of
oz
then
why
did
she
not
stay
there
observed
the
guard
reasonably
enough
anyone
coming
into
this
forest
comes
under
the
rule
of
gloma
witch
of
the
black
forest
witch
coughed
the
pig
as
dorothy
tightening
her
clutch
on
his
neck
almost
choked
him
yes
witch
repeated
the
forester
calmly
now
then
hold
up
your
heads
you
pale
and
pinky
skins
for
you
are
in
for
a
good
blacking
and
before
pigasus
knew
just
what
was
happening
the
ground
slipped
away
from
under
him
and
he
and
dorothy
were
plunged
into
the
rough
chilly
waters
of
a
tumbling
forest
stream
striking
out
with
all
four
feet
pigasus
managed
to
breast
the
flood
when
he
felt
himself
and
dorothy
being
forced
completely
under
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
guard
swimming
beside
him
had
simply
put
his
hand
on
dorothy
head
and
pushed
her
and
the
squealing
pig
beneath
the
surface
as
they
rose
gasping
and
sputtering
he
again
seized
pigasus
by
the
wing
and
pulled
him
quickly
to
shore
there
now
you
all
right
he
boomed
heartily
as
dorothy
rolled
off
the
pig
back
and
began
shaking
the
water
from
her
eyes
and
hair
and
wringing
out
her
dripping
skirts
just
blot
yourselves
on
the
bank
ourselves
gurgled
pigasus
giving
himself
a
violent
shake
do
you
take
us
for
letters
you
you
be
sorry
for
this
but
right
in
the
middle
of
his
angry
sputters
he
gave
a
loud
and
astonished
squall
dorothy
dorothy
i
can
see
panted
the
pink
pig
exultantly
so
can
i
cried
dorothy
running
excitedly
toward
him
but
everything
looks
black
everything
is
black
even
you
oh
oh
perfectly
coal
black
piggins
am
i
black
too
of
course
answered
the
guard
in
a
bored
voice
and
much
better
so
since
you
are
black
yourselves
you
can
see
in
the
dark
like
the
rest
of
us
and
what
do
you
think
of
our
forest
now
but
dorothy
instead
of
telling
him
held
up
her
shiny
black
hands
touched
a
few
strands
of
her
perfectly
black
hair
and
then
dropping
her
head
on
the
shoulder
began
to
weep
bitterly
like
drops
of
ink
the
tears
coursed
down
her
ebony
cheeks
and
though
pigasus
did
what
he
could
to
comfort
her
she
continued
to
sob
as
if
her
heart
would
break
well
i
must
say
i
call
this
ungrateful
the
guard
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
what
the
matter
with
you
anyway
black
is
a
splendid
color
does
show
dirt
does
fade
or
streak
besides
it
against
the
law
to
be
any
other
color
in
this
forest
how
dare
you
blacken
us
against
our
will
burst
out
pigasus
furiously
wait
till
i
get
loose
i
why
i
tear
you
to
pieces
and
pitch
you
into
a
tar
barrel
oh
do
make
me
snort
the
huge
black
forester
stared
contemptuously
down
at
the
winged
pig
and
now
that
pigasus
had
a
better
look
at
him
he
saw
the
folly
of
his
threats
for
the
black
guard
was
well
over
six
feet
and
lean
and
tough
as
black
leather
evidently
feeling
he
had
wasted
enough
time
on
the
pair
he
gave
them
a
very
black
look
and
jerking
the
pig
wing
roughly
started
walking
stolidly
through
the
forest
never
had
dorothy
felt
so
blue
or
rather
so
black
and
blue
so
wet
so
discouraged
so
thoroughly
miserable
and
when
sticking
out
her
tongue
to
see
if
it
was
still
pink
she
discovered
that
it
too
was
black
she
began
sobbing
softly
to
herself
no
one
will
know
us
any
more
she
decided
dejectedly
we
as
badly
off
now
as
ozma
and
the
others
why
oh
why
did
we
ever
come
into
this
terrible
forest
she
could
feel
pigasus
sniffing
with
sympathy
and
suddenly
realizing
that
she
was
not
behaving
very
well
she
straightened
up
after
all
she
still
was
a
princess
even
though
she
was
black
princesses
did
not
cry
even
when
they
were
captured
and
enchanted
ozma
was
probably
in
a
worse
fix
than
this
and
if
ozma
was
being
brave
she
would
be
brave
too
so
with
a
great
effort
dorothy
stifled
her
sobs
and
began
to
look
around
her
to
her
surprise
and
astonishment
she
discovered
that
the
black
forest
was
not
dark
and
gloomy
as
it
had
seemed
before
but
really
quite
beautiful
there
were
many
shades
and
degrees
of
blackness
in
the
trees
and
flowers
that
thickly
carpeted
the
ground
black
birds
twittered
musically
in
the
branches
overhead
and
every
now
and
then
a
deer
peered
timidly
out
at
her
from
the
woodsy
depths
between
the
tree
trunks
the
guard
glancing
over
his
shoulder
and
catching
her
interested
expression
ventured
a
smile
why
he
is
not
bad
looking
at
all
thought
dorothy
with
a
pleased
start
and
maybe
this
witch
may
be
a
good
witch
her
name
sounds
rather
pretty
quite
comforted
by
these
reflections
dorothy
whispered
a
few
rhymed
remarks
in
the
pig
ear
pigasus
it
must
be
confessed
was
as
interested
in
what
he
saw
as
dorothy
and
when
a
sudden
break
between
the
trees
revealed
a
great
black
circular
wall
with
a
hundred
black
flags
floating
from
its
many
turrets
he
gave
an
involuntary
grunt
of
admiration
you
are
about
to
enter
the
royal
circle
of
gloma
witch
of
the
black
forest
announced
the
guard
raising
his
hand
solemnly
i
trust
you
will
conduct
yourselves
in
a
fitting
manner
do
worry
about
our
manners
shrilled
pigasus
tossing
his
head
airily
we
are
accustomed
to
royalty
and
move
in
exclusive
circles
at
home
and
talk
in
circles
too
muttered
the
guard
impatiently
well
well
do
the
best
you
can
and
bow
three
times
as
you
approach
the
throne
throne
queried
dorothy
slipping
off
the
pig
back
so
she
would
not
have
to
talk
in
rhyme
for
what
she
had
to
say
to
the
black
witch
was
very
serious
indeed
is
gloma
a
queen
certainly
our
witch
is
a
queen
a
bewitching
queen
retorted
the
guard
taking
dorothy
firmly
by
the
hand
and
tightening
his
hold
on
pigasus
now
then
smile
and
look
pleasant
and
perhaps
she
allow
you
to
be
her
slave
she
would
dare
make
me
a
slave
cried
dorothy
trying
her
best
to
pull
away
from
her
captor
just
let
her
try
it
blustered
pigasus
scuffling
unwillingly
along
on
the
other
side
but
paying
no
attention
to
their
struggles
the
guard
lifted
his
foot
and
kicked
three
times
on
a
black
ebony
door
in
the
wall
and
a
tall
watchman
dressed
in
a
black
leather
suit
admitted
them
to
the
royal
circle
it
was
all
so
different
from
what
dorothy
had
been
expecting
she
almost
forgot
her
anger
enclosed
by
the
black
marble
wall
was
a
strange
and
enchanting
garden
now
dorothy
had
never
seen
a
black
garden
nor
dreamed
one
could
be
so
beautiful
here
sable
willows
mirrored
their
feathery
branches
in
long
shining
pools
here
black
plum
and
cherry
trees
flaunted
their
fragile
black
blossoms
and
jet
black
fountains
sent
their
smoking
waters
high
into
the
quiet
air
vast
satiny
expanses
of
lawn
were
dotted
with
a
hundred
beds
of
dusky
roses
tulips
velvety
pansies
and
daffodils
built
all
round
the
circular
wall
was
a
low
but
sumptuous
black
castle
and
seated
on
an
ebony
throne
in
the
center
of
her
stately
black
garden
was
the
black
queen
herself
looking
dorothy
was
thankful
to
discover
much
more
like
a
queen
than
a
witch
gloma
face
was
sweet
and
serious
her
hair
fine
and
glossy
as
a
raven
wing
she
was
dressed
in
a
trailing
robe
of
black
chiffon
that
billowed
in
lacy
clouds
round
her
feet
a
sparkling
crown
of
jet
and
long
jet
earrings
were
her
only
ornaments
on
each
side
of
the
black
queen
crouched
a
sleek
black
leopard
and
behind
the
ebony
throne
stood
ten
tall
foresters
with
gleaming
axes
like
headsmen
in
a
medieval
history
book
thought
dorothy
as
she
and
pigasus
were
dragged
rapidly
forward
gloma
gazing
dreamily
into
a
black
crystal
set
on
a
marble
stand
before
the
throne
seemed
entirely
unaware
of
their
presence
till
the
harsh
voice
of
the
black
guard
announced
them
hail
black
and
imperial
majesty
called
the
guard
deferentially
approaching
the
throne
two
prisoners
a
pig
and
a
princess
whom
i
found
wandering
unlawfully
in
our
forest
and
whom
i
took
the
liberty
of
blacking
dorothy
jerking
away
from
the
guard
was
about
to
explain
how
she
and
pigasus
had
lost
their
way
when
gloma
jumped
to
her
feet
with
a
sharp
agonized
scream
blotz
general
blotz
what
have
you
done
panted
the
black
queen
beating
her
hands
wildly
together
your
stupidity
has
ruined
us
all
you
have
blackened
and
insulted
my
most
dangerous
and
mortal
enemy
go
leave
begone
and
never
darken
my
doors
again
oh
why
why
did
you
do
it
why
have
you
brought
her
here
after
all
these
years
must
i
too
be
destroyed
and
obliterated
sinking
back
on
her
throne
gloma
covered
her
face
with
her
hair
and
began
rocking
backward
and
forward
in
agitation
and
sorrow
why
why
i
believe
she
afraid
of
you
puffed
pigasus
twitching
his
tail
with
excitement
and
interest
as
general
blotz
looking
quite
dazed
began
to
move
unhappily
toward
the
gate
in
the
wall
quick
he
grunted
as
the
ten
foresters
back
of
the
throne
rushed
forward
to
surround
them
do
something
dorothy
while
she
is
still
afraid
of
you
make
her
unblacken
us
tell
her
to
set
us
free
hurry
hurry
before
she
discovers
you
are
only
a
harmless
little
girl
but
dorothy
only
half
listening
to
the
pig
boldly
thrust
aside
the
foresters
and
ran
over
to
the
black
queen
why
are
you
afraid
of
me
asked
dorothy
speaking
rapidly
but
distinctly
i
did
not
come
here
on
purpose
pigasus
and
i
are
lost
and
need
your
help
help
shivered
gloma
shrinking
as
far
away
from
dorothy
as
possible
why
should
i
help
you
are
you
not
dorothy
the
mortal
girl
who
destroyed
the
powerful
witches
of
the
east
and
west
but
that
was
long
ago
explained
dorothy
breathlessly
as
two
of
the
queen
henchmen
seized
her
roughly
by
the
arms
and
they
were
bad
and
wicked
witches
why
should
i
wish
to
destroy
a
good
and
beautiful
witch
like
you
do
not
listen
to
her
do
not
let
her
touch
you
she
means
to
destroy
and
ensnare
you
hissed
the
foresters
as
they
dragged
dorothy
away
from
the
throne
down
with
all
mortals
away
to
the
dungeons
with
her
wing
that
pig
chop
off
their
heads
at
these
loud
savage
cries
startled
faces
appeared
at
the
windows
of
the
black
palace
and
struggling
in
the
midst
of
the
foresters
dorothy
heartily
wished
she
had
taken
the
pig
advice
shall
we
take
off
her
head
or
later
puffed
the
fellow
who
had
hold
of
her
left
arm
now
roared
the
axman
who
had
hold
of
her
right
stop
commanded
the
queen
rising
suddenly
you
can
not
harm
this
girl
do
you
not
see
the
star
of
protection
on
her
forehead
at
these
words
the
woodsmen
stared
fearfully
down
at
dorothy
and
sure
enough
shining
in
the
center
of
her
black
forehead
was
a
pure
white
star
pigasus
who
had
not
noticed
it
before
himself
gave
a
grunt
of
relief
and
began
kicking
out
in
every
direction
how
about
the
pig
yelled
a
forester
leaning
down
to
rub
his
shins
shall
we
take
off
his
head
if
you
dare
touch
pigasus
screamed
dorothy
resolved
to
use
the
powers
she
was
supposed
to
have
i
turn
you
all
to
bats
and
beetles
and
horrid
black
ants
a
breathless
silence
followed
dorothy
threat
the
foresters
still
kept
their
hold
on
the
prisoner
but
at
as
great
a
distance
as
they
could
manage
do
as
you
wish
comrades
the
tallest
of
the
axmen
solemnly
broke
the
silence
but
i
for
letting
them
alone
i
never
been
an
ant
yet
and
do
intend
to
begin
now
come
away
to
the
dungeons
with
them
this
is
not
for
us
to
settle
with
axes
it
is
a
case
for
witch
work
you
are
right
the
queen
who
had
been
standing
motionless
as
a
statue
took
a
decisive
step
forward
take
them
away
but
not
to
the
dungeons
take
them
to
the
dark
room
in
my
imperial
palace
they
shall
see
what
happens
to
those
who
defy
gloma
witch
of
the
black
forest
aye
aye
they
shall
see
muttered
the
foresters
pushing
dorothy
and
pigasus
roughly
along
ahead
of
them
chapter
black
magic
dorothy
and
pigasus
were
hustled
into
the
black
castle
rushed
down
its
shiny
black
corridors
and
thrust
into
a
great
dark
room
so
quickly
they
had
no
opportunity
to
exchange
a
word
well
anyway
even
if
it
is
a
dark
room
we
can
still
see
whispered
dorothy
as
the
foresters
in
their
haste
to
get
away
from
such
dangerous
prisoners
fairly
tumbled
over
each
other
to
get
through
the
door
yes
puffed
pigasus
glumly
as
the
key
rasped
in
the
lock
and
the
first
thing
i
see
is
that
there
are
no
windows
if
there
was
a
window
we
could
fly
off
as
it
is
this
witch
will
make
short
work
of
us
i
wonder
how
much
magic
she
really
knows
sighed
dorothy
seating
herself
wearily
on
a
black
velvet
stool
i
wonder
said
pigasus
flinging
himself
crossly
on
the
floor
beside
her
and
what
all
this
stuff
about
your
being
her
worst
enemy
did
you
really
destroy
two
witches
and
could
you
destroy
her
although
pigasus
had
lived
in
the
emerald
city
for
several
years
he
was
not
familiar
with
all
of
the
history
that
had
taken
place
before
his
arrival
oh
all
that
happened
when
i
first
came
here
explained
dorothy
clasping
her
knees
with
both
hands
you
see
when
the
cyclone
blew
me
from
kansas
to
oz
my
house
fell
on
the
wicked
witch
who
ruled
the
munchkins
and
killed
her
the
munchkins
supposing
i
had
done
it
on
purpose
came
out
and
thanked
me
and
gave
me
the
witch
silver
shoes
then
when
i
reached
the
emerald
city
and
begged
the
wizard
who
was
ruler
of
oz
at
that
time
to
send
me
back
to
kansas
he
promised
to
do
so
if
i
killed
the
wicked
witch
who
ruled
the
winkies
and
did
you
asked
pigasus
rolling
over
and
looking
up
at
dorothy
with
real
admiration
well
that
was
sort
of
an
accident
too
admitted
the
little
girl
honestly
when
the
tin
woodman
the
scarecrow
and
the
cowardly
lion
and
i
reached
the
witch
yellow
castle
the
witch
captured
us
all
and
made
me
work
hard
from
morning
till
night
but
one
day
dorothy
with
an
anxious
eye
on
the
door
hurriedly
continued
one
day
when
she
tried
to
steal
my
silver
shoes
i
got
so
mad
i
picked
up
a
bucket
of
water
i
been
using
for
scrubbing
and
flung
it
right
over
her
head
and
did
that
destroy
her
pigasus
demanded
incredulously
yes
said
dorothy
it
melted
her
down
to
nothing
at
all
but
what
about
the
star
i
never
noticed
that
before
that
where
the
good
witch
of
the
north
comes
in
answered
dorothy
proudly
right
after
my
house
fell
on
the
wicked
witch
of
the
west
she
appeared
and
when
she
discovered
i
was
a
mortal
she
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
to
keep
me
from
harm
all
the
time
i
was
in
oz
it
only
shows
now
because
i
black
i
suppose
well
why
did
it
keep
you
from
turning
black
if
it
so
wonderful
pigasus
switched
his
curly
tail
resentfully
i
do
know
dorothy
looked
thoughtfully
around
gloma
strange
laboratory
maybe
the
spell
has
worn
off
maybe
there
no
harm
in
being
black
humph
there
may
not
be
any
harm
in
it
but
it
pretty
sad
and
mournful
if
you
ask
me
grunted
pigasus
glaring
savagely
at
his
satiny
black
sides
i
prefer
myself
pink
and
you
pink
and
white
the
way
you
were
tea
and
turnips
first
thing
i
know
you
be
powdering
your
nose
with
ashes
and
soot
but
after
all
pigasus
swung
himself
energetically
to
his
feet
that
is
the
least
of
our
troubles
what
do
you
suppose
this
witch
will
do
to
us
now
and
what
can
we
do
to
her
sa
hay
spreading
his
wings
pigasus
spun
round
in
a
triumphant
circle
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
find
some
water
why
it
simple
as
soup
quick
dorothy
look
and
see
whether
there
is
any
water
around
here
then
as
soon
as
gloma
pops
her
nose
in
the
door
we
put
her
out
as
neatly
as
you
did
that
other
witch
but
those
other
witches
were
bad
and
gloma
seems
really
good
and
beautiful
objected
dorothy
looking
around
without
much
enthusiasm
beautiful
or
not
she
a
dark
and
dangerous
lady
insisted
the
pig
beginning
his
search
in
a
methodical
way
and
it
her
beauty
or
ours
remember
this
black
queen
is
quite
determined
to
destroy
us
if
we
do
destroy
her
first
yes
i
suppose
so
agreed
dorothy
slowly
following
pigasus
she
pulled
aside
black
velvet
curtains
peered
behind
cupboards
and
screens
and
looked
under
sofas
and
chairs
there
were
many
ebony
cabinets
standing
against
the
wall
but
each
one
was
securely
locked
and
except
for
a
great
black
crystal
ball
on
a
table
in
the
center
of
the
room
there
seemed
to
be
no
magic
apparatus
at
all
a
dark
lantern
swinging
from
the
domed
ceiling
cast
its
curious
luminous
black
rays
into
every
corner
of
the
witch
laboratory
after
circling
the
room
three
times
pigasus
and
dorothy
were
forced
to
admit
there
was
no
water
of
any
kind
or
even
a
pail
available
we
have
to
think
of
something
else
grumbled
the
pig
as
dorothy
again
sat
down
on
her
stool
are
you
thinking
he
demanded
sharply
as
the
little
girl
stared
absently
at
the
tips
of
her
boots
no
confessed
dorothy
frankly
i
was
just
wondering
why
gloma
calls
this
a
dark
room
she
must
know
since
general
blotz
ducked
us
under
the
black
river
we
can
see
in
here
as
well
as
in
the
forest
i
would
be
too
sure
of
that
muttered
the
pig
coming
over
and
crowding
as
close
to
dorothy
as
he
could
it
almost
seemed
as
if
someone
had
heard
him
for
scarcely
were
the
words
out
of
his
mouth
before
the
dark
lantern
over
their
heads
sputtered
ominously
and
went
out
leaving
them
in
a
perfectly
pitch
black
total
darkness
i
i
i
felt
something
like
this
would
happen
faltered
pigasus
throwing
his
left
wing
protectingly
around
dorothy
listen
someone
is
coming
a
light
sure
footstep
sounded
in
the
passage
came
closer
then
a
sudden
puff
of
air
told
them
that
someone
had
opened
the
door
remember
piggins
dear
no
matter
what
happens
we
must
be
brave
whispered
dorothy
trembling
a
little
in
spite
of
herself
it
hard
to
be
brave
in
the
dark
but
i
do
my
best
here
lean
on
me
and
though
the
happenings
of
the
next
ten
minutes
were
enough
to
try
the
courage
of
a
dozen
lions
pigasus
kept
his
word
and
never
uttered
a
sound
as
the
two
prisoners
clung
desperately
together
the
crystal
on
the
center
table
received
a
sudden
shattering
blow
up
spurted
a
perfect
fountain
of
fire
coming
down
over
dorothy
and
pigasus
in
a
shower
of
red
hot
sparks
but
the
sparks
fell
harmlessly
as
raindrops
on
the
winged
pig
and
the
little
girl
and
after
a
great
hiss
and
sputter
went
out
leaving
the
laboratory
in
darkness
again
scarcely
had
they
recovered
from
this
shock
before
a
second
blow
was
struck
and
this
time
a
hundred
huge
hideous
black
snakes
came
writhing
out
of
the
crystal
their
green
glittering
eyes
lighting
up
the
room
with
a
terrifying
sulphurous
light
the
great
twisting
mass
grew
more
and
more
menacing
sending
out
its
long
curving
bodies
like
arms
to
encircle
them
this
thought
dorothy
burying
her
head
in
pigasus
wing
was
black
magic
at
its
worst
now
she
could
feel
the
clammy
coils
all
around
her
and
waited
breathlessly
to
be
crushed
and
broken
but
the
cold
heavy
bodies
seemed
powerless
and
without
weight
and
presently
they
too
slipped
away
and
vanished
a
shower
of
silver
arrows
followed
the
snakes
and
a
cloud
of
choking
green
smoke
the
arrows
but
each
blow
on
the
crystal
only
seemed
to
prove
further
the
potency
of
the
kiss
set
on
dorothy
forehead
so
long
ago
by
the
good
witch
of
the
north
and
because
she
clung
so
tightly
to
pigasus
he
too
came
unharmed
through
the
ordeal
as
they
both
almost
afraid
to
breathe
waited
for
the
next
blow
on
the
dark
crystal
a
long
tremulous
sigh
came
mournfully
through
the
darkness
it
is
no
use
murmured
a
discouraged
voice
my
black
magic
is
of
no
avail
come
then
destroy
me
if
you
must
but
do
it
quickly
and
i
pray
you
will
spare
my
people
who
have
never
harmed
or
hurt
a
living
soul
in
oz
with
a
little
thrill
dorothy
recognized
the
voice
of
the
black
queen
and
as
the
dark
lantern
again
shed
its
twinkling
rays
over
the
circular
apartment
gloma
rose
and
came
calmly
and
rapidly
toward
them
dorothy
and
pigasus
who
had
just
had
their
own
bravery
so
severely
tested
could
not
but
admire
the
spirit
and
bravery
of
the
witch
of
the
black
forest
even
though
she
was
sure
she
faced
certain
destruction
she
walked
proudly
erect
her
head
flung
back
her
great
mass
of
dusky
hair
billowing
behind
her
stop
cried
dorothy
on
whom
the
queen
dark
beauty
had
made
a
deep
and
lasting
impression
why
should
we
wish
to
destroy
you
we
came
through
the
yellow
wood
and
from
there
into
the
black
forest
but
we
only
wished
to
go
through
as
quickly
as
possible
we
are
in
trouble
ourselves
did
you
know
that
ozma
of
oz
the
wizard
of
oz
the
four
rulers
of
oz
and
many
others
have
vanished
there
is
a
false
emperor
on
the
throne
in
the
emerald
city
and
under
the
magic
of
his
enchantment
all
the
people
have
forgotten
ozma
ever
was
their
queen
pigasus
and
i
escaping
this
enchantment
are
trying
to
find
ozma
and
someone
to
help
us
restore
her
to
power
dorothy
spoke
with
such
earnestness
and
feeling
gloma
could
not
help
believing
her
then
then
you
did
not
come
here
to
destroy
me
at
all
she
exclaimed
with
an
unhappy
and
embarrassed
glance
at
her
two
prisoners
forgive
me
for
using
my
magic
powers
i
only
wanted
to
save
myself
and
my
foresters
from
obliteration
oh
that
all
right
dorothy
dismissed
with
a
careless
shrug
the
danger
and
discomfort
of
the
last
hour
you
thought
we
were
going
to
destroy
you
so
of
course
you
tried
to
destroy
us
first
that
was
fair
enough
and
i
do
blame
you
but
now
that
we
understand
each
other
better
perhaps
you
will
help
us
do
you
yourself
remember
ozma
and
is
your
magic
powerful
enough
to
tell
us
where
she
is
seating
herself
in
a
chair
near
dorothy
footstool
gloma
stared
thoughtfully
at
the
velvet
carpet
i
know
or
remember
nothing
of
the
present
history
of
oz
she
told
them
after
a
short
silence
at
the
time
the
wizard
of
oz
ruled
oz
i
ruled
by
royal
right
and
inheritance
the
entire
southern
part
of
the
winkie
empire
although
the
wicked
witch
of
the
east
claimed
dominion
over
the
whole
country
she
only
succeeded
in
bringing
the
central
and
northern
parts
under
her
control
we
in
the
south
were
free
but
when
word
came
that
a
mortal
girl
had
destroyed
both
the
witch
of
the
east
and
the
witch
of
the
west
i
being
a
witch
naturally
supposed
i
would
be
the
next
one
to
suffer
destruction
so
calling
together
the
strongest
and
most
faithful
of
my
subjects
i
begged
them
to
retire
with
me
to
a
safe
and
hidden
spot
where
we
could
live
in
safety
and
tranquillity
far
from
the
wars
dangers
and
changing
fortunes
of
the
times
many
of
my
southern
winkies
cast
their
lot
with
the
new
order
marching
off
to
the
north
but
many
came
with
me
and
retiring
to
this
hidden
forest
we
cut
ourselves
off
from
all
intercourse
with
the
other
kingdoms
of
oz
living
the
free
and
happy
life
of
foresters
and
enjoying
all
the
beauty
and
benefits
of
outdoor
sport
and
activity
of
the
rulers
in
oz
since
the
wizard
i
know
nothing
whatever
and
were
you
always
black
inquired
pigasus
peering
inquisitively
up
into
gloma
face
and
wondering
whether
the
two
small
black
wings
on
each
side
of
her
forehead
were
as
useful
as
his
own
no
admitted
the
queen
smiling
graciously
down
at
her
plump
questioner
that
was
part
of
our
disappearing
plan
in
a
dark
forest
we
were
so
much
less
likely
to
be
found
or
discovered
so
with
my
knowledge
of
the
black
arts
i
turned
myself
and
my
subjects
as
black
as
you
now
see
us
what
a
shame
what
a
pity
dorothy
jumped
up
and
perched
cozily
on
the
arm
of
the
black
queen
chair
if
you
had
just
come
to
the
emerald
city
we
could
have
been
friends
all
this
while
why
not
begin
now
smiled
the
queen
putting
her
arm
affectionately
round
dorothy
waist
and
you
must
not
be
sorry
for
us
for
here
we
have
been
perfectly
happy
and
content
and
i
have
grown
so
fond
of
my
black
forest
and
castle
i
would
not
change
their
lovely
sable
for
all
the
other
colors
in
the
rainbow
but
tell
me
quickly
again
all
that
has
happened
in
oz
and
perhaps
i
can
make
amends
for
the
shabby
treatment
you
have
received
at
our
hands
contritely
the
black
queen
leaned
down
to
pat
pigasus
and
as
dorothy
sketched
in
most
of
the
important
happenings
in
oz
since
the
reign
of
the
wizard
the
little
pig
pressed
closely
against
her
side
with
many
interested
nods
and
exclamations
gloma
listened
and
when
dorothy
described
the
great
festival
that
had
been
planned
to
celebrate
the
discovery
of
oz
by
mortals
how
ozma
and
all
her
most
important
visitors
and
advisers
had
vanished
at
the
banquet
and
a
false
emperor
taken
possession
of
the
palace
the
queen
rose
and
walked
solemnly
over
to
the
black
crystal
but
after
a
long
look
into
its
inky
depths
gloma
turned
sadly
away
my
black
magic
can
not
help
you
she
told
them
regretfully
the
rulers
of
oz
and
your
other
friends
have
been
enchanted
by
green
magic
and
only
by
green
magic
can
they
be
released
and
restored
to
power
but
i
can
assist
you
in
other
ways
added
the
queen
noting
the
disappointed
expressions
on
the
faces
of
her
two
new
friends
one
tap
of
my
scepter
will
transport
you
to
any
country
and
here
from
a
drawer
in
the
ebony
table
the
queen
drew
a
small
black
round
box
in
this
container
you
will
find
a
most
powerful
powder
of
darkness
one
pinch
of
this
powder
tossed
into
the
air
will
cause
a
black
cloud
a
mile
square
to
envelop
and
totally
darken
a
city
or
country
while
no
one
in
this
darkened
area
will
be
able
to
see
you
it
will
be
perfectly
possible
for
you
to
see
them
as
clearly
as
in
the
usual
daylight
in
case
of
danger
it
affords
a
safe
way
of
escape
from
the
enemy
to
dispel
the
cloud
you
merely
close
the
box
that
ought
to
be
just
the
thing
to
use
if
we
ever
get
back
to
the
emerald
city
observed
pigasus
scratching
his
left
ear
with
his
right
hind
paw
why
we
could
swoop
down
on
this
emperor
bind
him
fast
and
tweak
him
by
the
nose
before
he
even
knew
what
was
happening
why
so
we
could
beamed
dorothy
brightening
up
at
once
and
now
though
of
course
black
is
a
perfectly
beautiful
color
could
you
change
us
back
to
the
colors
we
were
when
we
came
dorothy
spoke
timidly
for
she
did
not
want
to
hurt
gloma
feelings
as
soon
as
you
leave
the
forest
you
will
resume
your
natural
coloring
the
witch
assured
them
with
a
little
smile
and
where
may
i
ask
were
you
planning
to
go
first
well
said
dorothy
slowly
i
thought
perhaps
the
countries
outside
of
oz
might
not
be
under
this
forgetting
spell
and
that
we
might
find
in
one
of
them
a
king
who
would
lend
us
his
army
and
help
us
to
chase
skamperoo
out
of
the
emerald
city
could
you
transport
us
as
far
as
ev
your
majesty
as
easily
as
i
could
invite
you
to
dinner
gloma
assured
them
with
an
energetic
little
nod
and
i
hope
you
will
not
only
have
dinner
but
rest
yourselves
before
you
start
again
on
your
dangerous
journey
pigasus
pigasus
did
you
hear
that
she
can
transport
us
all
the
way
to
ev
did
i
tell
you
we
might
find
a
good
witch
in
this
forest
now
everything
will
be
all
right
so
glad
we
met
and
got
acquainted
you
not
so
black
as
you
are
painted
chuckled
pigasus
breaking
into
rhyme
from
sheer
good
humor
and
relief
and
did
i
hear
your
majesty
invite
us
to
dinner
you
certainly
did
said
gloma
and
dropping
them
a
little
bow
she
swept
gaily
through
the
door
d
suppose
it
will
be
a
black
dinner
whispered
pigasus
trotting
briskly
along
beside
dorothy
i
heard
of
light
repasts
but
never
of
dark
ones
but
i
do
care
i
hungry
enough
to
eat
tar
pudding
with
cinder
sauce
sh
hh
warned
dorothy
with
a
little
laugh
she
hear
you
chapter
farewell
to
the
black
forest
although
the
dinner
in
the
black
castle
was
as
dark
a
repast
as
pigasus
had
predicted
never
had
he
or
dorothy
dined
more
royally
nor
partaken
of
more
delicate
fare
the
black
bean
soup
was
followed
by
a
black
fish
course
then
came
the
dark
meat
of
some
superbly
cooked
fowl
probably
as
pigasus
remarked
in
one
of
his
humorous
asides
the
licorice
was
the
most
delicious
of
the
vegetables
though
the
black
asparagus
and
potatoes
were
appetizing
too
black
bread
was
served
with
the
black
grape
salad
and
plum
cake
with
black
frosting
with
the
black
ices
and
blackberryade
the
members
of
household
now
that
their
fear
of
dorothy
had
been
explained
away
proved
so
interesting
and
merry
the
time
simply
flew
the
black
lace
frocks
of
the
women
and
children
and
the
soft
leather
suits
of
the
black
foresters
were
simple
but
elegant
and
the
black
queen
herself
so
lovely
just
to
look
at
her
gave
one
a
curious
thrill
general
blotz
recalled
from
banishment
by
blackjack
the
queen
pet
jackdaw
proved
a
singer
of
no
mean
ability
and
regaled
the
company
with
many
famous
black
ballads
and
hunting
songs
pigasus
too
contributed
to
the
general
fun
and
gaiety
with
some
of
his
best
songs
and
verses
and
ate
so
many
slices
of
the
black
plum
cake
dorothy
began
to
feel
positively
uneasy
interesting
and
delightful
as
it
all
was
the
little
girl
could
not
help
thinking
of
ozma
and
her
other
unfortunate
and
captive
friends
and
as
the
black
banjo
clock
in
the
corner
of
the
hall
struck
a
musical
ten
she
lightly
touched
the
arm
of
gloma
the
black
queen
had
graciously
placed
dorothy
beside
her
i
think
we
had
better
go
now
whispered
dorothy
earnestly
if
pigasus
eats
any
more
he
fall
asleep
and
we
have
to
wait
till
morning
gloma
smiled
and
nodded
understandingly
then
pressing
dorothy
hand
for
goodbye
stole
quietly
off
to
her
workshop
dorothy
tried
to
signal
pigasus
across
the
gleaming
black
table
but
before
she
could
catch
his
eye
he
had
vanished
and
she
herself
was
whirling
dizzily
through
space
maybe
it
would
have
been
better
to
have
spent
the
night
in
the
castle
mused
dorothy
spreading
her
arms
like
wings
as
she
sailed
through
the
air
i
do
suppose
we
be
able
to
see
in
the
dark
now
that
we
are
out
of
the
black
forest
and
goodness
knows
where
come
down
there
was
no
moon
and
peer
about
as
she
would
dorothy
could
not
even
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
flying
pig
of
course
dorothy
went
on
conversationally
to
herself
we
could
have
flown
all
this
distance
on
piggin
back
but
this
is
quicker
and
less
trouble
but
oh
dear
i
do
hope
he
all
right
her
worry
about
the
pink
pig
ended
rather
abruptly
for
at
that
very
moment
she
began
to
somersault
over
and
over
in
a
headlong
drop
to
the
ground
a
painful
grunt
as
she
landed
assured
her
of
the
pig
presence
what
you
trying
to
do
puncture
me
puffed
pigasus
as
dorothy
with
an
embarrassed
little
gasp
of
apology
rolled
off
his
back
such
rudeness
grunted
her
companion
scrambling
to
his
feet
with
an
angry
snort
flinging
us
out
of
her
castle
as
if
we
been
garbage
yes
garbage
he
repeated
winking
rapidly
it
was
my
fault
cried
dorothy
moving
over
to
smooth
out
his
ruffled
wing
feathers
i
asked
her
to
transport
us
to
ev
and
oh
piggins
by
the
light
of
a
crooked
lamp
set
in
a
crevice
of
the
rocky
path
on
which
they
found
themselves
dorothy
regarded
him
rapturously
you
pink
again
am
i
well
that
something
waddling
closer
to
the
lamp
pigasus
examined
himself
with
careful
attention
you
pink
too
he
said
a
little
more
pleasantly
but
these
magic
transportations
are
a
bit
sudden
if
you
ask
me
and
i
not
at
all
sure
i
like
this
spot
where
are
we
anyway
oh
it
all
right
and
now
we
do
have
to
travel
at
all
here
announced
dorothy
who
had
hurried
on
a
few
steps
ahead
and
where
is
here
grumbled
pigasus
following
pompously
more
from
too
much
plum
cake
than
from
a
desire
to
be
disagreeable
why
at
kalico
mountain
exclaimed
dorothy
pointing
excitedly
to
a
small
door
in
the
rocky
surface
before
them
now
we
do
have
to
decide
between
the
gnome
king
and
the
king
of
ev
since
we
are
here
we
try
kalico
first
trying
him
is
all
very
well
but
i
hope
he
does
not
try
any
magic
on
us
yawned
pigasus
squinting
sleepily
up
at
the
brass
sign
hung
on
the
stout
wooden
door
what
does
it
say
there
a
green
lantern
hung
over
the
door
and
by
its
flickering
light
dorothy
read
slowly
back
door
of
the
gnome
king
underground
castle
no
dogs
babies
or
chickens
allowed
no
gold
fish
wanted
no
peddlers
or
snailsmen
need
apply
keep
out
and
stay
out
this
means
you
oh
that
all
right
laughed
dorothy
as
pigasus
looked
rather
alarmed
at
the
sternly
worded
notice
we
not
babies
or
chickens
or
gold
fish
and
kalico
a
friend
of
mine
come
on
lifting
the
knocker
and
smiling
confidently
dorothy
knocked
three
times
on
the
gnome
king
back
door
chapter
in
kalico
castle
what
is
it
shoofenwaller
kalico
the
thin
and
gray
little
king
of
the
gnomes
peered
impatiently
down
from
the
great
carved
rock
that
served
him
for
a
throne
shoo
go
away
you
know
this
is
my
hour
for
retiring
go
away
i
tell
you
and
if
you
never
come
back
it
will
still
be
too
soon
yes
but
your
majesty
while
obediently
backing
toward
the
door
the
king
royal
chamberlain
extended
his
arms
imploringly
something
has
come
up
the
long
eared
hearer
reports
footsteps
on
the
south
mountain
two
visitors
are
about
to
enter
the
back
door
of
our
castle
visitors
exclaimed
kalico
getting
up
with
an
impatient
flounce
at
this
hour
well
tell
them
to
go
away
and
come
back
tomorrow
here
wait
a
moment
as
shoofenwaller
shrugging
his
narrow
shoulders
turned
to
carry
out
his
orders
kalico
changed
his
mind
just
hand
me
my
expectacles
commanded
the
king
crossly
i
may
as
well
have
a
look
at
the
prowling
pests
with
another
shrug
shoofenwaller
stepped
to
a
small
cabinet
and
taking
a
pair
of
smoked
glasses
from
the
top
drawer
handed
them
up
to
the
king
now
kalico
expectacles
were
very
useful
enabling
him
to
see
who
was
coming
before
they
arrived
and
clapping
them
hurriedly
on
his
thin
nose
he
stared
intently
off
into
space
at
what
he
saw
the
king
expression
changed
from
irritation
to
vague
uneasiness
botheration
he
muttered
morosely
it
one
of
those
mortals
from
the
emerald
city
why
ca
those
girls
stay
home
always
poking
their
noses
into
other
people
affairs
and
trying
to
save
somebody
from
something
which
one
is
it
asked
shoofenwaller
blinking
it
dorothy
sighed
kalico
taking
off
his
expectacles
and
putting
them
absently
into
his
pocket
and
there
a
queer
kind
of
winged
pig
with
her
a
pig
with
wings
mind
you
rooks
and
rockets
wonder
what
they
want
why
not
find
out
suggested
shoofenwaller
reasonably
no
no
not
tonight
kalico
waved
his
hands
determinedly
just
conduct
them
to
the
red
guest
cave
shoofenwaller
and
bring
them
to
me
in
the
morning
with
a
stiff
bow
the
royal
chamberlain
backed
out
the
door
and
pattered
away
to
admit
the
visitors
and
about
time
too
thought
dorothy
as
the
rock
door
opened
cautiously
and
the
little
crooked
gnome
thrust
out
his
head
in
the
name
of
king
kalico
the
first
i
hereby
welcome
you
to
gnome
man
land
began
shoofenwaller
pompously
oh
that
all
right
yawned
pigasus
wearily
what
we
want
is
a
place
to
sleep
and
remember
no
trickery
he
added
sharply
as
the
gnome
stood
aside
so
that
they
could
enter
the
narrow
rock
passageway
i
suppose
your
highness
comes
on
a
matter
of
state
remarked
shoofenwaller
turning
from
pigasus
with
an
involuntary
grimace
pigs
reminded
him
of
ham
ham
reminded
him
of
eggs
and
eggs
were
immediate
death
and
destruction
to
gnomes
well
yes
admitted
dorothy
adjusting
her
step
to
the
short
crooked
legs
of
the
king
little
counselor
what
i
really
need
is
an
army
an
army
groaned
shoofenwaller
realizing
what
bad
news
this
would
be
for
his
master
our
army
oh
let
talk
about
all
that
in
the
morning
wheezed
pigasus
as
dorothy
briskly
nodded
her
head
in
answer
to
shoofenwaller
question
the
pink
pig
was
taking
sleepy
sidelong
squints
at
the
elegantly
excavated
and
corridors
of
the
gnome
king
underground
dwelling
just
what
his
majesty
suggested
muttered
the
chamberlain
sweeping
open
a
red
iron
door
with
a
ruby
knob
i
trust
you
will
be
comfortable
here
and
rest
well
if
your
highness
wishes
a
cup
of
kalicocoa
or
your
friend
a
mud
pie
or
pudding
just
ring
the
bell
goodnight
princess
goodnight
er
er
pig
i
resent
that
pigasus
cocked
his
ears
belligerently
as
the
king
crooked
little
messenger
bowed
himself
out
the
door
did
you
notice
the
way
he
said
dorothy
yes
said
dorothy
with
a
little
yawn
i
did
but
then
all
gnomes
are
sassy
and
you
have
to
get
used
to
them
if
kalico
helps
us
all
we
care
about
pigasus
nodded
rather
grimly
i
suppose
this
is
what
you
call
getting
down
to
bed
rock
he
murmured
looking
around
the
red
rock
apartment
with
his
amused
blue
stare
hope
the
beds
are
rock
too
punching
a
red
sofa
experimentally
and
finding
it
surprisingly
soft
the
pink
pig
jumped
up
and
settled
himself
cozily
among
the
cushions
pigasus
had
lived
in
castles
and
palaces
all
his
life
and
was
so
accustomed
to
comfort
and
luxury
that
without
bothering
to
look
around
richly
appointed
guest
cavern
he
closed
his
eyes
and
fell
asleep
dorothy
tiptoeing
through
a
curtain
into
an
adjoining
red
rock
cavern
that
served
as
a
bedroom
undressed
quickly
and
putting
out
the
ruby
lamps
slid
thankfully
between
the
red
silk
sheets
and
was
soon
as
soundly
asleep
as
pigasus
they
were
just
having
breakfast
served
by
two
small
gnomen
in
their
red
when
shoofenwaller
came
hurrying
in
to
announce
that
kalico
was
ready
and
waiting
to
see
them
earlier
the
gnome
king
and
his
chamberlain
had
discussed
the
possible
purposes
of
dorothy
visit
and
kalico
had
been
extremely
annoyed
to
learn
that
she
wanted
to
borrow
his
army
and
you
will
lend
it
to
her
all
our
hundred
thousand
trained
gnomen
yoemen
questioned
shoofenwaller
anxiously
what
else
can
i
do
kalico
snapped
his
little
gray
eyes
unhappily
remember
it
was
dorothy
who
stole
the
former
gnome
king
magic
belt
and
really
was
the
means
of
my
becoming
king
that
so
muttered
shoofenwaller
pulling
his
ear
reflectively
but
why
not
use
a
little
strategy
in
this
conference
king
why
not
pretend
to
help
her
and
at
the
same
time
safeguard
your
own
interests
lending
our
army
is
a
dangerous
experiment
suppose
an
enemy
threatened
us
while
our
fighting
forces
were
in
the
emerald
city
anything
could
happen
put
her
off
make
excuses
urged
shoofenwaller
craftily
this
suggestion
fell
in
exactly
with
the
gnome
king
wishes
and
curious
to
know
what
really
had
brought
dorothy
to
his
castle
he
sent
his
little
chamberlain
hurrying
off
to
bring
her
to
the
throne
room
and
now
for
a
little
kalicoaxing
sniffed
pigasus
waddling
unconcernedly
along
beside
dorothy
under
magnificent
arches
over
artificial
terraces
and
rock
gardens
gazing
down
long
vistas
of
yet
unmined
shafts
where
hundreds
of
gnomes
worked
busily
with
picks
and
shovels
to
further
enrich
the
already
enormously
rich
and
powerful
little
metal
monarch
kalico
as
they
entered
the
beautifully
furnished
and
lavishly
carved
cave
that
he
used
for
a
throne
room
came
hurrying
to
meet
them
so
charming
of
you
to
come
all
this
way
just
to
see
me
murmured
the
gnome
king
taking
both
of
dorothy
hands
in
his
own
and
bowing
graciously
as
she
introduced
pigasus
always
delighted
to
entertain
a
princess
from
the
court
of
her
royal
highness
ozma
of
oz
oh
kalico
then
you
do
remember
her
oh
please
dear
kalico
will
you
help
us
to
find
her
find
her
why
what
under
the
earth
do
you
mean
is
ozma
lost
kalico
long
face
at
dorothy
excited
greeting
grew
visibly
longer
and
after
the
little
girl
had
explained
the
disappearance
of
ozma
and
the
others
the
enchantment
of
all
the
people
in
oz
and
the
coming
of
skamperoo
to
the
emerald
city
kalico
climbed
wearily
back
on
his
throne
and
sat
down
this
this
is
shocking
faltered
kalico
mopping
his
forehead
with
a
long
gray
cobweb
and
just
what
do
you
and
this
this
pig
intend
to
do
about
it
what
do
you
intend
to
do
about
it
rather
tired
of
being
called
a
pig
pigasus
planted
all
four
feet
and
stared
defiantly
up
at
the
perturbed
metal
monarch
well
er
that
is
er
i
do
see
that
it
is
my
affair
at
all
mumbled
kalico
with
a
rueful
nod
of
his
head
anyone
powerful
enough
to
conquer
ozma
and
oz
would
pay
small
attention
to
opinions
of
mine
but
we
do
want
your
opinions
stated
pigasus
bluntly
what
we
want
is
your
army
and
any
magic
you
can
conveniently
spare
please
kalico
do
help
us
begged
dorothy
running
up
the
carved
rock
steps
of
the
throne
and
seating
herself
coaxingly
on
the
arm
with
all
your
thousands
of
gnomes
and
many
magic
powers
we
can
certainly
drive
skamperoo
out
of
the
emerald
city
well
of
course
sighed
kalico
flattered
by
dorothy
reference
to
his
magic
powers
i
do
what
i
can
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
it
will
take
more
than
one
army
to
reconquer
oz
as
he
said
this
kalico
looked
across
at
shoofenwaller
and
the
little
chamberlain
well
pleased
with
his
master
strategy
gave
him
an
encouraging
wink
i
tell
you
what
i
do
kalico
crossed
his
legs
and
regarded
dorothy
through
eyes
if
you
find
another
king
willing
to
send
army
into
oz
i
will
also
send
mine
remember
even
ozma
closest
friends
and
retainers
have
forgotten
her
and
the
entire
population
now
fully
convinced
skamperoo
is
their
rightful
ruler
will
rise
to
oppose
us
yes
yes
but
have
you
no
magic
that
will
dispel
this
wicked
enchantment
or
help
us
to
locate
our
friends
and
sovereigns
demanded
pigasus
not
wholly
satisfied
with
the
gnome
king
offer
gnome
magic
may
be
of
no
use
in
this
case
nevertheless
i
will
send
for
my
wizard
and
see
what
can
be
done
remembering
their
last
experience
with
magic
dorothy
stepped
down
from
kalico
throne
and
seated
herself
quietly
on
the
pink
pig
back
and
pigasus
grunting
with
relief
squinted
suspiciously
at
the
small
ugly
wizard
of
the
underworld
who
presently
came
shuffling
into
the
royal
presence
chamber
as
quickly
as
possible
kalico
explained
to
the
wizard
all
the
dire
happenings
in
oz
do
you
think
our
magic
spyglass
could
locate
ozma
and
her
missing
friends
and
associates
or
tell
us
whether
they
have
been
utterly
and
completely
destroyed
demanded
the
gnome
king
gravely
potaroo
the
king
magician
stood
pulling
his
straggly
whiskers
for
several
moments
after
kalico
had
finished
speaking
then
he
stamped
four
times
on
the
flagged
floor
with
his
right
foot
almost
instantly
four
gnome
wise
men
in
peaked
hats
came
into
the
throne
room
wheeling
a
huge
telescope
before
them
dorothy
and
pigasus
prickling
with
suspense
and
terror
watched
the
wizard
screw
his
eye
to
the
end
of
the
twisting
spyglass
after
several
snorts
and
surprised
exclamations
potaroo
straightened
up
the
missing
ozians
and
the
wizard
of
ev
are
hidden
away
in
thunder
mountain
he
stated
in
a
hoarse
whisper
an
electric
little
silence
followed
potaroo
disclosure
and
as
no
one
uttered
a
sound
the
wizard
continued
as
the
spyglass
is
now
pointing
north
i
believe
you
will
find
thunder
mountain
in
that
direction
but
i
must
warn
you
that
it
will
be
a
long
and
exceedingly
dangerous
journey
danger
well
what
do
we
care
for
that
quick
somebody
fetch
me
my
coat
my
hat
this
hardly
seems
a
time
for
jokes
and
verses
murmured
kalico
looking
at
dorothy
in
mild
disapproval
she
has
to
make
verses
and
rhymes
when
she
rides
me
i
a
poetry
pig
and
a
lucky
star
guides
me
grunted
pigasus
too
overcome
by
the
wizard
awful
news
to
realize
he
was
speaking
in
verse
himself
oh
what
difference
does
it
make
cried
dorothy
jumping
quickly
off
his
back
we
must
go
to
thunder
mountain
at
once
pigasus
can
fly
there
here
here
not
in
such
a
hurry
exclaimed
kalico
secretly
delighted
at
the
prospect
of
being
so
easily
rid
of
his
troubles
we
must
pack
you
a
lunch
basket
and
tell
me
potaroo
have
you
any
magic
that
will
make
the
journey
less
dangerous
for
these
brave
young
adventurers
m
agic
stuttered
potaroo
his
eyes
growing
glassy
at
the
mere
thought
of
parting
with
any
of
his
magic
treasures
well
er
i
could
lend
them
a
box
of
my
famous
triple
action
stumbling
blocks
they
will
overthrow
any
enemy
no
matter
how
numerous
splendid
beamed
kalico
rubbing
his
hands
briskly
together
and
do
forget
in
the
course
of
your
journey
north
if
you
find
a
king
willing
to
lend
his
army
my
army
also
will
be
ready
and
at
your
service
oh
kalico
how
you
are
running
up
the
steps
of
the
throne
again
dorothy
gave
the
gnome
king
an
impulsive
hug
come
on
come
on
squealed
pigasus
who
had
seen
the
various
winks
between
kalico
and
shoofenwaller
and
was
convinced
that
the
little
gnome
king
was
doing
as
little
as
he
possibly
could
give
us
our
lunch
and
our
stumbling
blocks
and
we
be
off
and
i
must
say
they
be
an
enormous
help
when
we
reach
thunder
mountain
spreading
his
wings
pigasus
began
to
fly
in
angry
circles
round
the
gnome
king
head
humph
pork
going
up
sniffed
shoofenwaller
as
he
hurried
away
to
see
about
packing
the
lunch
basket
he
ought
to
be
dried
smoked
and
salted
muttered
potaroo
going
sulkily
off
to
fetch
the
blocks
dorothy
in
earnest
consultation
with
kalico
heard
neither
of
these
remarks
and
when
a
few
moments
later
the
two
returned
with
two
boxes
and
dorothy
hat
and
coat
she
thanked
them
politely
called
pigasus
down
from
a
rocky
ledge
where
he
had
flown
and
climbed
happily
on
his
back
then
pigasus
not
giving
her
time
for
any
lengthy
farewells
zipped
through
the
tunneled
caverns
and
corridors
of
the
gnome
king
underground
dominions
and
burst
thankfully
out
the
back
door
of
south
mountain
now
let
see
which
way
is
north
mused
pigasus
twirling
his
curly
tail
around
like
a
propeller
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
fly
north
to
thunder
mountain
unlock
its
thunder
bolts
restore
the
rulers
of
oz
toss
tumbling
blocks
at
all
enemies
raise
a
grand
army
and
then
then
king
kalico
will
help
us
is
it
just
magniferous
why
piggins
how
mean
of
you
surely
you
know
the
gnome
king
our
friend
do
you
like
kalico
no
said
pigasus
fiercely
hurling
himself
into
the
air
well
anyway
we
better
off
than
we
were
before
thought
dorothy
after
several
rhymed
attempts
to
draw
pigasus
into
a
conversation
at
least
we
now
know
where
ozma
is
and
have
two
kinds
of
magic
and
the
promise
of
an
army
really
we
getting
on
quite
fast
but
perhaps
had
she
seen
the
king
and
his
chamberlain
nodding
their
heads
like
two
little
china
mandarins
as
she
and
pigasus
left
the
throne
room
she
would
not
have
felt
so
cheerful
that
the
last
we
ever
see
of
her
chuckled
shoofenwaller
dropping
a
dried
lizard
instead
of
a
lump
of
sugar
into
his
tea
gnomes
always
flavor
their
tea
with
lizards
no
one
yet
has
ever
come
safely
back
from
thunder
mountain
but
what
about
this
new
emperor
of
oz
oh
that
will
be
all
right
kalico
waved
one
hand
airily
i
would
much
rather
have
a
man
on
the
throne
of
oz
ozma
is
always
involving
me
in
wars
or
demanding
the
rights
of
smaller
kingdoms
so
long
may
she
stay
in
thunder
mountain
and
long
skamperoo
rule
in
oz
long
live
the
emperor
echoed
shoofenwaller
and
clicking
their
teacups
gaily
together
the
two
bad
little
gnomes
drained
to
the
last
drop
their
black
and
bitter
tea
and
we
should
not
be
too
hard
on
kalico
i
suppose
for
like
all
the
dwellers
under
the
earth
his
heart
is
gray
and
flinty
as
the
rock
that
forms
his
cavern
the
blood
in
his
veins
cold
and
sluggish
as
the
leaden
waters
of
the
underground
rivers
that
wind
sullenly
through
his
dark
domain
chapter
the
emperor
of
oz
the
same
morning
dorothy
wakened
in
the
rustic
summer
house
of
the
winkie
farmer
skamperoo
opened
his
eyes
upon
the
unaccustomed
grandeur
of
ozma
royal
palace
the
banquet
had
lasted
till
long
after
three
then
still
chuckling
and
yawning
he
had
waved
goodnight
to
his
hilarious
and
amiable
subjects
and
led
chalk
off
to
bed
twenty
footmen
with
twenty
lighted
tapers
preceded
him
to
own
apartment
but
dismissing
this
as
too
plain
and
simple
he
had
taken
the
immense
green
guest
suite
across
the
hall
chalk
would
have
much
preferred
a
stall
in
the
royal
stable
with
the
other
members
of
the
castle
party
but
skamperoo
would
not
hear
of
such
a
separation
he
wanted
his
white
wishing
horse
close
at
hand
not
only
because
through
him
and
the
magic
emeralds
he
could
satisfy
every
wish
but
because
for
the
first
time
in
his
long
lazy
selfish
life
he
had
found
someone
he
liked
better
than
himself
in
eyes
chalk
was
absolutely
perfect
and
as
his
own
wish
had
brought
the
charger
into
being
he
felt
proud
and
important
as
a
parent
with
his
first
child
after
a
few
regretful
sniffs
out
of
the
window
a
few
short
turns
up
and
down
their
immense
and
elegant
sleeping
apartment
chalk
leaped
lightly
on
one
of
the
large
green
beds
and
settled
himself
gracefully
for
the
night
covering
chalk
tenderly
with
a
green
satin
quilt
skamperoo
hastily
disrobed
and
clutching
his
precious
necklaces
climbed
wearily
into
the
other
bed
there
without
even
stopping
to
wish
himself
goodnight
he
fell
into
a
deep
and
tranquil
slumber
indeed
both
in
spite
of
the
strangeness
of
their
surroundings
slept
soundly
till
morning
about
eight
chalk
lifting
his
head
from
the
embroidered
pillow
looked
indulgently
across
at
the
new
emperor
of
oz
sitting
up
in
bed
skamperoo
was
busily
counting
the
gems
in
his
three
magic
chains
ho
throw
those
silly
beads
away
advised
the
white
horse
jumping
out
of
bed
with
a
gay
toss
of
his
golden
mane
you
have
nothing
else
to
wish
for
kingaling
nothing
more
at
all
m
mmm
this
green
carpet
looks
good
enough
to
eat
but
i
a
fancy
to
nibble
the
clover
in
your
majesty
garden
while
it
is
still
fresh
with
dew
say
it
again
begged
skamperoo
closing
his
eyes
and
clasping
himself
blissfully
around
the
middle
your
majesty
garden
your
majesty
palace
your
majesty
kingdom
of
oz
whinnied
the
white
horse
rising
on
his
hind
legs
and
pirouetting
round
with
mischievous
little
prances
but
come
emp
what
are
your
wishes
for
today
i
think
we
will
have
to
use
the
necklaces
after
all
you
must
certainly
have
some
new
clothes
it
would
never
do
to
appear
this
morning
in
the
suit
you
wore
last
night
you
had
better
have
some
sleeping
garments
too
i
a
notion
that
emperors
do
not
sleep
in
their
raw
hides
like
horses
skamperoo
giggling
dragged
the
satin
sheets
up
to
his
chin
for
to
tell
the
truth
he
had
arrived
in
the
emerald
city
with
only
one
suit
to
his
back
and
an
extremely
shabby
one
at
that
maybe
i
better
change
my
face
too
he
murmured
to
go
with
all
this
you
know
dreamily
skamperoo
waved
his
hands
about
and
then
leaning
forward
slipped
the
chains
over
chalk
ear
what
the
matter
with
the
face
you
have
demanded
chalk
gazing
fondly
at
the
red
rotund
countenance
of
his
master
i
like
you
just
as
you
are
and
if
you
change
i
would
even
know
you
but
tell
you
what
you
wish
after
you
ordered
yourself
some
new
clothes
wish
yourself
a
seasoned
rider
and
then
we
can
go
far
and
wide
kingaling
far
and
wide
at
a
furious
gallop
and
none
shall
say
us
nay
hey
hey
and
none
shall
say
us
nay
trilled
skamperoo
rolling
out
of
bed
covers
and
all
to
wish
himself
fifty
robes
with
boots
crowns
and
all
the
undergarments
to
go
with
them
fifty
splendid
sleeping
robes
and
fifty
suits
of
riding
clothes
took
but
a
moment
he
and
chalk
could
hear
them
landing
with
little
thuds
on
the
hangers
in
the
many
closets
as
skamperoo
finished
speaking
then
being
naturally
lazy
the
new
emperor
wished
that
he
had
already
had
his
bath
and
was
dressed
in
his
green
riding
clothes
so
immediately
he
was
and
winking
at
his
clever
assistant
adviser
he
next
wished
himself
the
best
rider
in
oz
then
taking
back
his
necklaces
he
buttoned
them
carefully
in
a
little
pocket
over
his
heart
and
went
over
to
the
mirror
to
have
a
look
at
himself
how
about
this
governing
stuff
puffed
the
emperor
turning
this
way
and
that
to
get
a
good
view
of
his
new
clothes
oh
i
should
bother
about
governing
answered
chalk
carelessly
a
country
like
this
should
be
able
to
run
itself
for
a
few
weeks
by
that
time
we
be
ready
for
more
serious
matters
but
right
now
i
all
for
enjoying
myself
a
splendid
idea
that
of
putting
all
the
rulers
and
the
wizard
and
his
magic
out
of
the
way
the
rest
of
your
court
and
subjects
are
exceedingly
sensible
and
jolly
and
if
we
are
pleasant
and
sensible
too
everything
will
be
ho
and
so
cozy
so
let
go
below
and
start
our
first
day
of
emperoaring
impatiently
chalk
pranced
away
toward
the
door
you
sure
i
look
all
right
asked
skamperoo
with
another
anxious
squint
at
his
reflection
seems
to
me
i
a
bit
too
fat
oh
do
worry
about
that
said
chalk
rolling
his
eyes
wickedly
come
along
come
along
and
i
soon
shake
some
of
that
fat
off
you
up
with
you
kingaling
and
let
to
our
oats
to
his
delight
and
pleasure
skamperoo
had
not
the
slightest
trouble
mounting
and
once
in
the
saddle
he
felt
perfectly
at
home
even
when
chalk
bounded
through
the
door
took
the
long
circular
steps
between
a
canter
and
a
gallop
and
ran
madly
three
times
round
the
royal
gardens
on
fine
days
ozma
always
had
breakfast
in
her
private
garden
and
it
being
an
especially
fine
day
the
palace
servants
without
thought
or
question
had
placed
the
royal
table
under
the
trees
it
was
still
fairly
early
and
none
of
the
guests
or
members
of
the
household
were
down
but
this
did
not
spoil
skamperoo
excellent
appetite
at
all
ordering
chalk
a
breakfast
of
oats
bran
and
quartered
apples
he
seated
himself
gaily
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
green
riding
hat
set
well
over
one
ear
became
him
vastly
well
and
chalk
regarding
him
proudly
from
the
foot
of
the
table
thought
him
every
inch
an
emperor
even
if
round
the
waist
there
were
a
good
many
too
many
inches
i
wish
pinny
penny
could
see
you
now
sighed
the
horse
sinking
contentedly
back
on
his
haunches
and
how
i
should
have
enjoyed
seeing
matiah
face
when
he
finally
discovered
you
and
the
necklaces
were
gone
by
the
way
perhaps
we
should
do
something
about
matiah
pinny
penny
will
attend
to
him
said
skamperoo
popping
a
huge
cherry
into
his
mouth
and
nodding
his
head
reassuringly
i
wager
pinny
penny
sent
the
fellow
packing
the
moment
he
found
himself
king
wonder
how
pinny
is
making
out
anyway
but
suppose
matiah
should
follow
us
here
went
on
chalk
having
been
in
existence
only
two
days
he
knew
little
of
oz
or
geozophy
he
ca
come
here
skamperoo
told
him
triumphantly
there
a
deadly
desert
between
skampavia
and
oz
that
no
one
in
my
lifetime
or
in
mine
has
ever
crossed
that
is
with
the
exception
of
ourselves
and
we
were
wished
across
which
does
count
then
as
four
footmen
with
heaping
trays
appeared
he
winked
at
chalk
and
the
white
horse
lapsed
into
a
thoughtful
silence
and
skamperoo
had
been
perfectly
correct
in
his
conjectures
about
pinny
penny
when
with
a
resounding
clunk
the
king
gold
crown
had
fallen
upon
the
astonished
prime
minister
his
head
had
gone
entirely
through
so
he
was
forced
to
wear
it
much
as
a
dog
wears
a
collar
but
even
so
he
was
not
slow
to
realize
the
significance
of
this
odd
happening
or
the
power
it
brought
with
it
gripping
the
scepter
which
had
forced
itself
into
his
hand
he
rushed
into
the
throne
room
to
find
out
what
strange
whim
of
his
master
had
made
him
acting
king
of
the
realm
a
glance
around
the
throne
room
was
enough
to
show
him
that
skamperoo
was
not
there
and
when
he
saw
matiah
sitting
so
unconcernedly
in
the
book
alcove
a
sudden
rage
and
conviction
seized
him
whatever
had
happened
matiah
was
to
blame
leave
this
palace
at
once
shouted
pinny
penny
stamping
first
one
foot
and
then
the
other
at
once
do
you
hear
or
i
call
out
the
guard
matiah
still
deep
in
the
history
of
oz
looked
up
in
astonishment
and
when
he
saw
the
little
prime
minister
wearing
skamperoo
crown
round
his
neck
and
brandishing
his
scepter
he
gave
a
perfect
bellow
of
anger
and
dismay
where
the
king
he
roared
looking
wildly
around
the
throne
room
and
why
are
you
wearing
his
crown
where
skamperoo
where
the
necklaces
ask
yourself
raged
pinny
penny
shaking
the
scepter
threateningly
everything
was
quiet
and
peaceful
till
you
and
your
necklaces
arrived
at
this
palace
there
some
magic
trickery
about
them
and
about
you
do
think
i
was
fooled
by
that
horse
story
a
horse
does
not
appear
out
of
the
air
well
now
the
king
gone
the
horse
is
gone
and
unless
you
are
gone
in
ten
seconds
i
have
you
thrown
out
of
the
window
ten
seconds
do
you
hear
this
crown
and
scepter
came
to
me
through
no
wish
or
choice
of
my
own
but
since
they
did
come
to
me
i
am
the
king
and
i
intend
to
rule
this
country
my
first
official
act
will
be
to
rid
myself
of
your
filthy
presence
now
then
start
walking
merchant
and
do
stop
till
you
reach
the
border
twenty
guards
will
follow
to
see
you
safely
out
of
the
country
you
wait
till
skamperoo
hears
about
this
blustered
matiah
backing
away
in
alarm
from
the
determined
little
prime
minister
i
more
important
to
him
than
anyone
else
then
why
are
you
with
him
inquired
pinny
penny
shrewdly
no
wherever
he
gone
he
has
gone
without
you
i
am
the
king
and
i
do
not
need
you
so
be
off
clapping
his
hands
pinny
gave
a
sharp
command
to
the
guards
who
came
hurrying
in
answer
to
his
summons
retiring
rapidly
to
escape
the
tips
of
their
sharp
spikes
matiah
sullenly
began
his
long
march
it
was
nightfall
by
the
time
the
little
company
reached
the
edge
of
skampavia
here
in
a
wilderness
of
rock
and
rubble
the
guardsmen
left
him
with
food
enough
for
a
couple
of
days
and
stern
warnings
never
to
return
to
skampavia
far
to
the
west
the
miserable
merchant
could
see
the
comforting
lights
of
merryland
but
he
had
no
desire
to
go
there
or
east
to
the
kingdom
of
ix
instead
he
stared
hopelessly
across
the
wilderness
to
where
the
heaving
sands
of
the
deadly
desert
gleamed
like
molten
silver
in
the
moonlight
how
had
that
rascally
monarch
ever
escaped
without
his
seeing
him
how
could
he
ever
safely
cross
the
deadly
desert
and
hope
to
reach
oz
how
had
skamperoo
who
seemed
so
dumb
and
foolish
ever
discovered
the
secret
of
using
the
magic
emeralds
when
he
himself
had
failed
to
do
so
how
how
how
crouched
on
a
flat
rock
munching
one
of
the
sandwiches
left
by
the
guards
matiah
scowled
evilly
across
the
grim
desert
his
thoughts
as
treacherous
and
shifting
as
its
deadly
sands
chapter
the
dooners
all
day
with
only
a
short
pause
for
lunch
pigasus
had
flown
north
dorothy
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
thunder
mountain
or
mountains
of
any
sort
but
the
wild
desolate
country
through
which
they
were
flying
was
flat
and
apparently
perfectly
uninhabited
a
fine
healthy
chance
we
have
of
finding
an
army
here
snorted
pigasus
as
the
afternoon
drew
to
a
hot
weary
close
and
what
do
when
we
find
thunder
mountain
i
have
the
faintest
notion
have
you
even
if
i
butt
my
nose
black
blue
and
blunt
and
you
break
both
knuckles
beating
on
its
rocky
exterior
how
can
we
ever
hope
to
enter
such
a
place
much
less
release
our
unfortunate
sovereigns
i
told
you
kalico
was
a
scoundrel
i
wager
he
sent
us
on
a
wild
goose
chase
just
to
get
us
out
of
the
way
ah
do
say
i
told
you
so
there
always
some
way
you
know
said
dorothy
almost
as
as
pigasus
though
she
would
not
admit
it
the
pink
pig
rather
ashamed
of
himself
flew
for
several
miles
without
saying
anything
then
in
rather
a
gruff
voice
he
called
dorothy
attention
to
the
changing
nature
of
the
scenery
below
notice
the
hills
he
snorted
more
hopefully
maybe
there
is
a
mountain
after
all
but
the
sun
going
down
and
i
ready
to
sink
myself
so
let
descend
and
see
whether
we
can
find
a
soft
rock
on
which
to
lay
our
heads
not
hills
dunes
cried
dorothy
bouncing
off
as
soon
as
pigasus
touched
the
earth
sand
dunes
we
must
be
near
the
coast
and
the
nonestic
ocean
it
does
smell
salty
agreed
pigasus
sniffing
the
air
eagerly
but
suppose
we
save
the
ocean
for
tomorrow
my
feet
ache
my
wings
ache
and
i
hollow
as
a
drum
then
we
have
supper
decided
dorothy
sensibly
so
seating
themselves
comfortably
with
their
backs
against
a
dune
the
two
weary
explorers
finished
up
all
the
cold
meat
fruit
pie
and
sandwiches
shoofenwaller
had
packed
up
for
them
after
a
long
wistful
sniff
into
the
box
convinced
him
there
was
not
another
crumb
pigasus
folded
his
wings
lay
down
in
the
soft
sand
at
the
foot
of
the
dune
giving
only
indistinct
grunts
and
snorts
to
dorothy
questions
and
observations
finally
getting
no
answer
at
all
dorothy
discovered
he
was
asleep
the
regular
rise
and
fall
of
the
pink
pig
sides
the
soft
drowsy
singing
of
the
west
wind
lulled
dorothy
into
a
pleasant
state
of
dreaminess
and
presently
with
her
head
comfortably
pillowed
on
the
pig
plump
shoulder
she
fell
asleep
too
it
must
have
been
hours
later
when
terrified
squeals
from
pigasus
and
the
patter
of
a
hundred
hurrying
feet
made
her
start
up
in
alarm
still
only
half
awake
she
was
startled
to
find
herself
and
pigasus
surrounded
by
a
horde
of
sandmen
in
the
pale
and
watery
moonlight
they
looked
like
creatures
out
of
some
very
bad
dream
their
bodies
were
roughly
moulded
of
sand
their
eyes
strangely
green
and
phosphorescent
while
their
hair
rising
like
beach
grass
from
their
pointed
heads
waved
about
their
lumpy
faces
clutching
the
basket
that
contained
her
small
store
of
clothing
the
black
witch
powder
of
darkness
and
potaroo
box
of
stumbling
blocks
dorothy
pressed
back
against
the
dune
her
first
idea
of
leaping
on
the
pig
back
and
bidding
him
fly
was
useless
pigasus
lay
helplessly
on
his
side
his
wings
and
legs
bound
tightly
with
long
strands
of
tough
strong
seaweed
thankful
to
find
that
she
at
least
was
free
dorothy
went
a
step
closer
to
her
struggling
squealing
furious
little
comrade
as
she
did
so
a
perfect
shower
of
sand
balls
came
flying
toward
them
the
sharp
sting
of
the
sandmen
missiles
not
only
awoke
her
completely
but
goaded
her
into
instant
and
angry
action
stop
that
stop
that
at
once
she
cried
stamping
her
foot
indignantly
but
her
words
only
brought
another
shower
of
sand
balls
down
on
their
heads
you
have
dared
to
invade
the
sacred
domain
of
the
dooners
yelled
the
rasping
voice
of
the
leader
rattling
a
long
string
of
sea
shells
he
wore
round
his
neck
and
therefore
you
shall
be
sand
balled
sand
bagged
and
made
into
sandwiches
for
the
sand
crabs
if
the
dooner
had
not
looked
so
wild
and
dangerous
his
foolish
threat
might
have
been
amusing
but
as
he
and
his
sandmen
came
leaping
forward
pigasus
gave
a
squeal
of
sheer
terror
and
dorothy
raising
the
basket
over
her
head
hurled
it
with
all
her
might
into
the
midst
of
the
advancing
army
the
effect
was
immediate
and
astonishing
cowering
down
beside
pigasus
and
expecting
to
be
seized
or
trampled
on
dorothy
saw
the
first
line
of
dooners
going
down
like
a
row
of
tenpins
then
all
the
others
began
tumbling
and
tripping
and
falling
in
heaps
no
sooner
would
a
sandman
rise
than
he
would
instantly
tumble
down
again
and
their
squalls
and
screeches
of
rage
were
so
piercing
dorothy
put
both
hands
over
her
ears
it
the
blocks
wheezed
pigasus
managing
to
lift
his
head
a
few
inches
kalico
stumbling
blocks
are
flying
like
fur
and
fury
now
if
they
just
keep
down
for
a
while
longer
we
might
get
away
dorothy
peering
sharply
into
the
midst
of
the
tumbling
dooners
saw
the
fifty
magic
squares
released
from
their
box
when
she
flung
her
basket
fairly
exploding
with
activity
and
scramble
up
as
they
would
after
each
tumble
the
sandmen
could
not
advance
an
inch
nor
even
manage
to
stand
erect
the
leader
attempting
to
crawl
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
was
caught
by
a
dozen
of
the
whirling
missiles
and
rolled
back
like
a
log
among
his
churning
comrades
hurray
three
cheers
for
kalico
puffed
pigasus
quick
my
girl
see
if
you
can
untie
these
wretched
seaweeds
and
we
be
flying
and
be
off
in
a
pigwhistle
i
had
a
pair
of
scissors
in
my
basket
if
it
has
fallen
out
and
anyway
i
not
going
without
my
things
declared
dorothy
now
quite
bold
since
the
enemy
had
been
overcome
by
magic
and
in
spite
of
the
pig
anxious
squeals
of
warning
she
rushed
forward
grabbed
her
basket
and
began
picking
up
her
scattered
belongings
noting
with
a
sigh
of
relief
that
the
box
containing
the
powder
of
darkness
was
still
closed
with
the
scissors
still
safe
in
the
little
pocket
in
the
side
of
the
basket
she
soon
clipped
the
seaweed
trusses
from
pigasus
and
clasping
the
basket
in
her
arms
climbed
swiftly
on
his
back
pigasus
without
one
backward
glance
rose
straight
into
the
air
and
again
headed
north
dorothy
peering
fearfully
over
his
left
wing
saw
the
dooners
spring
suddenly
to
their
feet
and
then
like
frightened
prairie
dogs
disappear
into
many
holes
in
the
sand
funny
mused
dorothy
that
they
had
not
noticed
these
openings
before
funny
that
the
dooners
had
stopped
stumbling
as
soon
as
she
and
pigasus
had
taken
to
the
air
funny
but
then
everything
was
funny
right
in
the
middle
of
her
conjectures
the
box
of
stumbling
blocks
now
closed
and
tied
with
a
red
ribbon
dropped
plink
into
the
middle
of
her
basket
someone
throwing
things
gasped
pigasus
flapping
his
wings
a
bit
faster
and
looking
rather
wildly
over
his
shoulder
no
just
our
box
of
stumbling
blocks
yawned
dorothy
now
that
the
excitement
was
over
she
felt
dreadfully
tired
and
even
the
sight
of
the
nonestic
ocean
rippling
and
gleaming
a
few
yards
ahead
did
not
arouse
or
interest
her
it
did
not
interest
pigasus
either
he
was
far
from
pleased
to
find
himself
so
near
the
coast
i
do
like
this
i
do
like
this
at
all
muttered
the
pig
perking
up
his
ears
and
wiggling
his
nose
rapidly
we
flown
straight
north
and
instead
of
striking
thunder
mountain
we
strike
the
sea
and
how
could
a
mountain
be
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
there
are
mountains
on
islands
and
i
have
a
notion
there
are
plenty
of
islands
out
there
in
the
ocean
said
dorothy
sleepily
recalling
the
days
she
had
studied
geography
in
the
united
states
take
japan
for
instance
over
there
mountains
are
simply
everywhere
i
do
care
if
they
are
answered
pigasus
fiercely
i
wo
go
to
japan
and
i
not
go
a
wing
breadth
over
this
ocean
tonight
islands
or
no
islands
sa
hay
there
the
north
star
to
our
left
so
not
going
north
at
all
we
off
our
course
that
what
we
are
north
star
north
star
of
course
we
are
mumbled
dorothy
with
a
drowsy
nod
you
asleep
scolded
pigasus
in
a
worried
voice
i
better
land
if
you
land
too
soon
you
strike
a
dune
warned
dorothy
with
another
yawn
and
after
a
quick
glance
below
and
convinced
they
were
still
over
the
dooner
domain
pigasus
spread
his
wings
a
bit
wider
and
swung
along
the
coast
looking
carefully
for
a
safe
place
to
land
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
night
he
was
so
busy
squinting
downward
that
he
never
saw
the
long
curious
shadow
shooting
after
him
with
incredible
accuracy
and
speed
a
terrific
blast
of
air
as
it
rushed
by
them
on
the
right
was
his
first
warning
of
danger
dorothy
too
caught
unaware
gave
a
faint
shriek
as
an
immense
body
curved
back
and
began
to
coil
round
and
round
them
like
some
gigantic
air
serpent
it
is
a
snake
thought
poor
dorothy
as
pigasus
hung
helplessly
in
the
little
circle
of
air
left
in
the
center
of
its
coils
neither
spoke
for
truly
there
seemed
nothing
to
say
or
do
then
just
as
the
suspense
grew
too
awful
to
be
endured
the
monster
opened
its
mouth
and
dorothy
backing
as
far
along
the
pig
back
as
she
possibly
could
almost
lost
her
balance
instead
of
a
tongue
or
long
tusks
out
popped
the
head
and
shoulders
of
a
little
old
man
no
larger
than
dorothy
herself
pardon
me
he
murmured
politely
i
was
looking
for
a
sea
serpent
do
i
look
like
a
sea
serpent
snorted
pigasus
in
a
quivering
voice
for
he
was
still
half
choked
from
shock
and
fright
if
you
and
that
monster
you
riding
are
looking
for
a
sea
serpent
go
ahead
look
for
one
but
leave
honest
travelers
alone
monster
exclaimed
the
little
man
in
a
hurt
voice
oh
i
say
now
you
have
us
all
wrong
this
is
no
monster
this
is
the
long
strong
flexible
stretchable
shooting
tower
of
my
private
castle
and
i
myself
am
bitty
bit
the
seer
of
some
summit
in
the
short
silence
that
followed
bitty
bit
astonishing
announcement
dorothy
examining
more
closely
the
coils
encircling
herself
and
pigasus
saw
that
they
really
were
of
stone
with
sections
between
what
she
had
taken
for
a
mouth
was
really
a
window
with
his
elbow
resting
on
the
ledge
bitty
bit
was
regarding
them
fixedly
well
even
if
you
are
a
seer
and
have
a
shooting
tower
grunted
pigasus
gathering
courage
as
he
went
along
there
is
no
reason
for
you
to
come
towering
over
us
this
way
but
a
seer
must
be
constantly
looking
for
things
explained
bitty
bit
spreading
his
hands
expansively
that
you
know
is
his
business
i
am
always
looking
for
something
and
tonight
it
happens
to
be
sea
serpents
sorry
to
disappoint
you
said
pigasus
more
mildly
but
since
we
are
not
sea
serpents
perhaps
you
be
good
enough
to
unwind
your
tower
as
it
happens
i
have
a
little
looking
to
do
myself
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
you
and
your
tower
overtook
us
i
was
searching
for
a
safe
place
for
this
young
princess
and
myself
to
spend
the
night
look
no
more
begged
bitty
bit
leaning
so
far
over
the
sill
dorothy
involuntarily
put
out
her
hand
to
save
him
from
falling
you
shall
both
spend
the
night
in
my
castle
come
grasping
dorothy
by
one
hand
and
pigasus
by
one
wing
the
little
seer
with
superhuman
strength
for
one
so
small
and
wrinkled
dragged
them
both
through
the
open
window
of
his
shooting
tower
chapter
the
seer
of
some
summit
since
coming
to
oz
dorothy
had
traveled
in
many
strange
ways
but
to
find
herself
shooting
through
the
midnight
sky
in
bitty
bit
tower
was
surely
the
oddest
of
all
both
she
and
pigasus
stared
from
the
window
in
wonder
as
the
tower
uncoiled
and
started
shrinking
rapidly
backward
we
may
as
well
go
home
at
once
observed
bitty
bit
rubbing
his
little
hands
briskly
together
you
are
much
more
interesting
than
sea
serpents
and
i
can
easily
look
for
sea
serpents
some
other
night
now
do
be
alarmed
when
we
bump
bump
repeated
dorothy
rather
nervously
of
course
the
sage
told
her
calmly
as
i
go
forward
the
tower
stretches
out
in
any
direction
i
wish
to
go
when
i
return
it
shrinks
contracts
and
retires
within
itself
like
a
telescope
and
by
the
time
we
reach
the
castle
it
is
no
larger
than
an
ordinary
tower
mm
better
hold
on
to
something
we
almost
there
running
around
the
circular
room
a
few
feet
from
the
wall
was
a
gold
railing
pigasus
had
just
time
to
hook
his
wing
around
this
railing
and
dorothy
to
seize
it
with
one
hand
when
bitty
bit
tower
with
a
resounding
crash
snapped
back
but
up
to
a
vertical
position
so
that
what
had
been
the
floor
of
the
little
room
became
the
east
wall
and
the
window
a
skylight
dorothy
and
pigasus
describing
a
complete
circle
on
the
bar
landed
in
a
more
or
less
upside
down
position
on
what
had
been
the
back
wall
that
why
i
have
it
cushioned
explained
the
seer
who
also
had
executed
a
neat
somersault
hopping
up
as
if
landing
on
his
head
was
a
perfectly
usual
and
ordinary
occurrence
bitty
bit
opened
a
trap
door
in
the
floor
and
motioned
for
dorothy
and
pigasus
to
follow
him
down
a
long
winding
stair
these
magic
contraptions
will
be
the
death
of
me
wheezed
pigasus
picking
himself
up
with
a
groan
the
cushioned
floor
had
made
his
fall
painless
but
he
was
considerably
jolted
and
upset
from
the
shock
or
rather
the
series
of
shocks
that
had
so
far
punctuated
their
evening
but
if
he
a
seer
whispered
dorothy
recovering
her
basket
and
trotting
eagerly
after
bitty
bit
he
ought
to
be
able
to
help
us
a
bitty
bit
sniffed
the
pink
pig
well
if
he
just
help
me
to
a
bed
i
be
satisfied
and
grunting
and
grumbling
he
clumped
sleepily
down
the
stairs
behind
dorothy
the
room
into
which
the
stone
stairway
led
them
was
evidently
the
cozy
and
comfortable
study
of
the
comical
little
seer
its
walls
were
of
oak
lined
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
books
and
all
its
furnishings
were
tan
or
brown
dorothy
considered
this
extremely
suitable
as
bitty
bit
himself
looked
like
a
very
wise
and
merry
brownie
on
his
little
round
head
was
a
round
cap
with
a
yellow
quill
and
he
wore
a
brown
wrinkled
robe
rather
like
a
monk
tied
tightly
round
the
waist
with
a
yellow
cord
his
bright
black
sharp
little
eyes
danced
with
good
humor
and
interest
in
his
honest
little
face
while
pigasus
stood
sleepily
and
somewhat
disapprovingly
on
the
hearth
rug
dorothy
sank
into
a
snug
brown
arm
chair
and
looked
expectantly
up
at
their
singular
host
no
no
not
a
word
begged
bitty
bit
raising
his
hand
pleadingly
remember
i
am
the
seer
of
some
summit
a
seer
who
can
see
and
foresee
a
seer
who
can
tell
and
foretell
just
by
closing
my
eyes
i
can
tell
who
you
are
whence
you
came
and
whither
you
are
going
fancy
that
now
observed
pigasus
in
a
mocking
voice
you
retorted
bitty
bit
pointing
a
skinny
brown
finger
at
the
pig
you
are
a
creation
of
my
friend
the
red
jinn
whose
taste
for
low
verse
i
always
knew
would
lead
him
into
some
mischief
low
verses
retorted
pigasus
indignantly
while
even
dorothy
looked
a
little
shocked
yes
low
verses
insisted
bitty
bit
solemnly
you
are
so
constructed
that
he
who
rides
must
rhyme
and
break
into
foolish
jingles
is
this
not
so
they
may
be
jingles
but
they
are
not
low
verse
protested
pigasus
flapping
his
ears
angrily
well
then
let
us
call
them
simple
verses
amended
bitty
bit
with
a
generous
wave
of
the
hand
at
least
they
are
verses
that
anyone
can
understand
which
of
course
makes
them
of
no
value
whatever
people
never
appreciate
what
they
can
understand
dorothy
does
declared
pigasus
now
mad
enough
to
fly
right
out
the
window
dorothy
ah
yes
i
was
coming
to
her
swinging
around
bitty
bit
his
eyes
still
tightly
shut
wagged
his
finger
at
the
astonished
little
girl
you
are
the
mortal
girl
who
came
to
oz
by
cyclone
you
live
in
the
emerald
city
of
oz
and
are
oh
tell
us
something
we
do
already
know
interrupted
pigasus
with
a
bored
yawn
where
is
ozma
of
oz
now
how
could
a
scalawag
emperor
steal
her
throne
wait
wait
give
me
time
not
a
word
more
not
a
word
panted
bitty
bit
advancing
with
short
dancing
steps
toward
dorothy
i
i
see
a
necklace
he
muttered
mysteriously
one
two
three
necklaces
i
see
a
white
horse
and
a
fat
fellow
wearing
a
small
emerald
crown
great
sea
bass
and
sassafrass
oz
has
been
conquered
its
inhabitants
enchanted
its
rulers
banished
and
the
king
of
skampavia
sits
on
the
throne
so
that
where
he
comes
from
breathed
dorothy
forgetting
bitty
bit
request
for
silence
oh
quick
tell
us
more
tell
us
more
and
help
us
to
restore
ozma
and
the
other
lost
sovereigns
to
power
i
am
only
a
seer
answered
the
sage
opening
his
eyes
wide
and
suddenly
i
can
see
and
foresee
tell
and
foretell
but
i
can
not
change
that
which
has
happened
or
is
about
to
happen
but
where
is
ozma
demanded
pigasus
edging
closer
if
you
are
a
seer
and
can
see
at
least
you
can
tell
us
where
she
is
in
this
way
pigasus
hoped
to
check
up
the
information
given
them
by
potaroo
the
gnome
king
wizard
so
again
bitty
bit
closed
his
eyes
and
pressing
his
fingers
to
his
forehead
spoke
ozma
my
old
friend
jinnicky
the
wizard
of
oz
a
soldier
with
green
whiskers
a
purple
horse
two
queens
two
kings
a
prince
the
tin
woodman
and
glinda
the
good
sorceress
are
lying
at
the
bottom
of
lightning
lake
which
is
on
the
top
of
thunder
mountain
bitty
bit
told
them
solemnly
lightning
lake
cried
dorothy
seizing
the
little
seer
frantically
by
the
shoulders
why
then
they
must
be
drowned
burned
and
destroyed
altogether
no
no
they
are
quite
calm
and
as
usual
bitty
bit
assured
her
hastily
in
fact
they
are
i
should
say
in
a
trance
of
some
kind
but
what
we
do
how
we
disenchant
them
or
find
thunder
mountain
loosing
her
hold
on
bitty
bit
dorothy
spun
round
three
times
and
then
started
firmly
for
the
door
my
shooting
tower
will
take
you
to
thunder
mountain
or
any
other
place
you
decide
you
must
go
promised
bitty
bit
hurrying
anxiously
after
the
little
girl
but
not
tonight
dorothy
not
tonight
we
are
all
tired
and
i
must
have
time
to
think
the
conquering
of
oz
is
a
great
shock
to
me
i
would
like
time
to
look
into
the
matter
more
fully
and
consider
all
of
these
strange
events
in
their
proper
order
this
problem
shall
be
my
pillow
i
sleep
on
it
my
dear
and
in
the
morning
will
doubtless
have
something
helpful
to
suggest
well
then
where
the
beds
yawned
pigasus
who
heartily
approved
of
bitty
bit
suggestion
or
are
we
to
sleep
on
our
problems
too
at
this
bitty
bit
who
seemed
to
find
pigasus
terribly
amusing
laughed
right
out
loud
then
taking
dorothy
arm
he
led
the
way
to
a
snug
little
bedroom
all
done
in
yellow
pigasus
had
a
gentlemanly
apartment
in
tan
next
door
and
both
were
so
weary
they
spent
little
time
examining
their
new
quarters
but
instead
went
directly
to
bed
and
to
sleep
when
dorothy
wakened
next
morning
she
looked
out
the
window
and
saw
pigasus
flying
in
slow
circles
round
the
tidy
castle
bitty
bit
brown
stone
palace
though
small
and
unpretentious
perched
right
on
top
of
some
summit
and
the
view
was
so
fine
and
the
mountain
air
so
fresh
and
invigorating
dorothy
in
spite
of
all
her
anxiety
and
worry
began
to
feel
happy
and
reckless
and
ready
for
anything
with
cheerful
little
glances
round
her
cozy
yellow
room
she
dressed
brushed
her
hair
till
it
shone
then
skipped
merrily
down
the
brown
marble
steps
and
out
into
the
garden
the
garden
really
a
series
of
sloping
terraces
was
bright
with
hardy
mountain
posies
with
spicy
sage
bushes
and
gnarled
old
trees
which
clung
like
acrobats
to
the
steep
rocks
and
dangerous
crevices
pigasus
catching
a
glimpse
of
dorothy
seated
on
a
smooth
rock
near
a
little
waterfall
came
swooping
down
to
wish
her
a
merry
morning
not
a
bad
little
palace
remarked
the
pig
considerately
not
a
bad
little
palace
at
all
though
so
far
as
i
can
see
there
not
a
man
servant
nor
a
woman
servant
or
even
a
ladybug
about
i
imagine
this
fellow
is
a
hermit
and
from
the
looks
of
him
probably
lives
on
tobacco
and
snuff
what
do
you
suppose
are
the
chances
for
breakfast
i
do
know
said
dorothy
refusing
to
allow
such
a
small
matter
as
breakfast
to
dash
her
spirits
have
you
seen
bitty
bit
this
morning
yes
sniffed
pigasus
beginning
to
poke
his
nose
hungrily
round
the
roots
of
a
dwarf
oak
before
i
flew
out
my
window
i
saw
him
going
into
his
brown
study
seer
goes
into
brown
study
how
that
for
the
first
announcement
of
the
day
you
awful
laughed
dorothy
giving
pigasus
a
little
push
no
just
awfully
hungry
grinned
pigasus
now
i
been
thinking
no
stepping
out
from
behind
a
sizable
bush
bitty
bit
regarded
the
pig
with
an
air
of
assumed
amazement
he
says
he
been
thinking
he
repeated
turning
solemnly
to
dorothy
must
be
the
air
up
here
that
about
all
i
had
retorted
pigasus
savagely
crunching
an
acorn
between
his
teeth
that
and
a
nibble
from
one
of
your
sage
bushes
sage
bush
eh
chuckled
bitty
bit
winking
at
dorothy
good
and
we
make
a
sage
of
you
yet
a
sausage
he
whispered
in
an
undertone
that
pigasus
heard
quite
distinctly
and
speaking
of
sausage
how
about
breakfast
though
bitty
bit
remark
about
the
sausage
still
rankled
pigasus
was
too
hungry
to
let
it
keep
him
from
following
the
seer
into
a
small
walled
garden
that
opened
out
from
the
larger
dining
hall
of
his
castle
here
on
a
small
table
covered
with
a
gay
yellow
cloth
was
assembled
the
most
appetizing
breakfast
dorothy
ever
had
tasted
ripe
melon
and
apricots
cereal
and
eggs
tiny
meat
pies
pancakes
and
honey
hot
rolls
and
steaming
brown
cocoa
there
was
a
huge
bowl
of
mush
and
cream
for
pigasus
and
another
of
buttermilk
and
under
the
soothing
influence
of
his
favorite
foods
pigasus
completely
forgot
his
annoyance
and
they
were
soon
chattering
away
like
old
friends
at
a
sunday
school
picnic
bitty
bit
chef
whom
the
pig
had
overlooked
in
his
grand
tour
of
the
palace
served
them
with
skill
and
speed
no
wonder
pigasus
had
not
seen
him
for
he
was
even
smaller
than
his
wrinkled
little
master
and
almost
completely
enveloped
in
a
great
brown
linen
apron
and
tall
brown
cap
dorothy
could
not
possibly
eat
all
the
dainties
pressed
upon
her
by
the
kind
little
seer
and
his
chef
but
she
nibbled
at
each
course
and
when
bitty
bit
saw
that
neither
she
nor
pigasus
could
down
another
bite
he
swallowed
the
rest
of
his
cocoa
and
bounced
briskly
to
his
feet
now
he
cried
tossing
away
his
gay
napkin
with
a
flourish
now
for
the
emerald
city
and
oz
but
i
thought
we
were
going
to
thunder
mountain
exclaimed
dorothy
pushing
back
her
chair
so
hurriedly
she
bumped
her
head
on
the
wall
that
exclaimed
bitty
bit
looking
over
his
shoulder
for
he
was
already
half
way
through
the
door
that
will
not
be
necessary
all
we
need
to
save
the
celebrities
of
oz
is
the
long
lost
wishing
emeralds
of
lorna
the
wood
nymph
lorna
coughed
pigasus
rolling
out
of
his
seat
and
falling
a
bit
sideways
for
pretty
sake
who
she
oh
come
along
urged
dorothy
and
without
wasting
another
second
she
pelted
into
the
brown
palace
after
bitty
bit
with
a
groan
pigasus
followed
and
groaned
again
when
he
realized
he
would
have
to
climb
three
flights
of
marble
steps
and
a
flight
of
stone
to
reach
the
famous
shooting
tower
then
suddenly
and
joyfully
remembering
his
wings
he
spread
them
wide
wings
hold
me
up
mumbled
the
pink
pig
stuffily
we
carrying
entirely
too
mush
mush
rising
rather
uncertainly
he
breathlessly
flapped
his
way
up
to
the
tower
room
where
dorothy
and
bitty
bit
impatiently
awaited
him
chapter
skamperoo
in
oz
in
the
company
of
scraps
the
scarecrow
the
royal
visitors
and
all
the
amusing
members
of
ozma
court
the
emperor
and
chalk
passed
a
gay
and
hilarious
morning
the
tableaux
and
pageants
proceeded
without
a
single
hitch
and
no
one
seemed
to
miss
dorothy
or
pigasus
at
all
nor
did
anyone
notice
the
omission
of
the
carefully
planned
groups
showing
the
wizard
arrival
in
oz
dorothy
first
visit
to
the
emerald
city
or
the
victory
of
nick
chopper
over
the
wolves
these
interesting
and
historical
events
might
just
as
well
never
have
happened
circus
later
in
the
afternoon
went
off
with
a
bang
even
without
pigasus
to
jump
through
hoops
and
fly
round
the
ring
waving
flags
while
scraps
did
her
acts
on
the
trapeze
and
tight
rope
the
picnic
supper
was
even
more
fun
than
the
circus
and
the
fireworks
set
off
by
tik
tok
who
was
in
no
danger
of
scorching
himself
the
best
of
all
indeed
skamperoo
first
day
in
the
emerald
city
had
been
so
full
and
so
interesting
he
had
not
made
a
single
wish
or
once
thought
of
his
magic
emeralds
funny
we
never
had
jolly
times
like
this
at
home
mused
skamperoo
putting
out
the
emerald
stars
in
the
ceiling
that
pleasantly
lighted
his
green
apartment
and
burrowing
happily
down
into
his
splendid
green
bed
oh
chalk
are
you
asleep
there
old
horse
as
no
answer
came
from
the
other
bed
skamperoo
let
himself
sink
a
bit
deeper
into
the
luxurious
nest
of
silken
covers
and
soon
was
asleep
himself
puffing
and
whistling
like
a
steamboat
but
the
strange
and
frightful
snoring
of
the
emperor
did
not
seem
to
stop
nor
scare
away
the
shadowy
figure
that
presently
came
stealing
into
the
royal
chamber
once
twice
three
times
long
skinny
fingers
reached
out
toward
the
thick
neck
of
the
snoring
ruler
of
oz
the
fourth
time
there
were
three
distinct
little
clips
and
when
the
curving
claw
withdrew
it
had
in
its
clutching
grasp
the
three
powerful
wishing
chains
then
without
waking
the
occupant
of
either
bed
the
thief
stole
quietly
into
the
shadows
now
the
scarecrow
delighted
with
the
success
of
the
celebration
so
far
had
suggested
a
series
of
athletic
contests
and
obstacle
races
for
next
day
and
skamperoo
had
heartily
agreed
to
his
plans
his
first
thought
on
waking
was
the
race
to
be
run
by
the
straw
man
and
himself
the
scarecrow
on
the
wooden
saw
horse
he
on
his
splendid
white
charger
i
wear
the
white
leather
breeches
and
shirt
puffed
skamperoo
bounding
out
of
bed
like
a
school
boy
he
had
taken
a
shower
and
donned
his
showy
riding
clothes
before
he
missed
his
magic
emeralds
then
all
at
once
as
he
stood
before
the
mirror
to
comb
his
hair
he
gave
a
loud
squall
of
anguish
chalk
chalk
roared
the
distracted
emperor
racing
over
to
the
balcony
and
leaning
so
far
out
over
the
railing
he
nearly
fell
on
his
crown
they
gone
they
gone
my
emeralds
my
necklaces
my
necklaces
my
emeralds
now
chalk
who
had
risen
early
to
nibble
the
clover
while
it
was
still
fresh
with
morning
dew
looked
up
in
alarm
then
as
his
master
voice
grew
louder
and
louder
and
his
gestures
more
spectacular
and
desperate
the
white
horse
rose
up
on
his
hind
legs
and
shook
his
head
in
violent
warning
and
displeasure
hush
he
directed
in
a
low
voice
i
be
right
up
making
his
way
quickly
but
cautiously
so
as
not
to
arouse
the
curiosity
of
any
of
the
palace
servants
already
at
work
in
the
lower
hallways
chalk
hurried
up
to
the
agitated
emperor
they
gone
blubbered
skamperoo
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
crying
like
a
baby
g
now
everything
is
ruined
and
i
have
nothing
left
at
all
well
you
still
have
me
murmured
chalk
resting
his
head
affectionately
on
skamperoo
shoulder
brace
up
kingaling
and
for
sake
be
quiet
no
one
here
knows
about
the
necklaces
and
until
the
rascal
who
has
stolen
them
learns
how
to
use
them
we
are
as
safe
as
soap
that
rascal
of
course
is
matiah
somehow
he
has
managed
to
cross
the
deadly
desert
yes
chalk
shook
his
mane
wrathfully
i
am
convinced
that
matiah
has
the
necklaces
but
what
good
are
they
to
him
when
we
alone
know
the
secret
that
makes
them
work
he
have
to
come
to
us
in
the
end
and
when
he
does
hah
chalk
expelled
the
air
from
his
nose
in
a
terrific
snort
just
let
me
take
care
of
him
but
should
we
give
the
alarm
have
a
search
made
for
him
and
try
to
recover
the
emeralds
let
him
alone
counseled
the
wishing
horse
firmly
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
sit
tight
on
the
throne
of
oz
remember
you
are
the
emperor
but
how
can
i
be
without
those
emeralds
skamperoo
dabbed
at
his
eyes
with
the
satin
bed
sheet
we
got
along
all
right
yesterday
said
chalk
calmly
come
cheer
up
skamper
everything
will
be
all
right
i
rather
counted
on
beating
the
scarecrow
in
that
race
this
morning
muttered
skamperoo
wistfully
how
can
you
run
as
fast
as
that
tireless
wooden
creature
who
was
magically
brought
to
life
well
was
i
magically
brought
to
life
the
white
horse
shook
his
mane
roguishly
come
along
kingaling
we
not
only
win
that
race
but
we
have
back
our
necklaces
and
chase
matiah
out
of
oz
before
we
are
through
i
i
really
believe
you
can
do
anything
sighed
skamperoo
getting
almost
cheerfully
to
his
feet
but
just
the
same
i
shall
keep
a
sharp
outlook
for
matiah
he
might
start
a
revolution
he
revolute
pretty
rapidly
if
i
once
get
my
heels
on
him
promised
chalk
with
a
wicked
grin
come
on
heads
up
and
who
afraid
however
in
spite
of
the
white
horse
valiant
attempts
to
comfort
him
skamperoo
spent
a
troubled
and
uneasy
day
casting
fearful
glances
behind
him
when
no
one
was
looking
searching
the
happy
holiday
crowds
with
haggard
glances
for
a
glimpse
of
the
long
thin
face
of
matiah
the
merchant
even
when
chalk
beat
the
sawhorse
in
their
long
exciting
race
through
the
park
and
the
crowds
cheered
themselves
hoarse
with
delight
and
approval
the
victory
was
spoiled
by
the
knowledge
that
somewhere
in
the
emerald
city
lurked
his
most
dangerous
and
relentless
foe
chalk
too
though
he
pretended
to
regard
the
matter
lightly
was
almost
as
worried
as
his
master
and
spent
every
free
moment
poking
his
head
into
doorways
and
peering
down
side
streets
and
rearing
up
over
walls
and
while
skamperoo
was
having
his
afternoon
nap
the
white
horse
systematically
searched
the
palace
from
top
to
bottom
even
the
cellar
but
in
the
cellar
chalk
did
not
go
quite
far
enough
for
it
was
in
a
hollowed
out
chamber
under
the
cellar
that
the
merchant
of
skampavia
was
really
hidden
here
with
a
goodly
supply
of
food
stolen
from
the
pantry
matiah
had
seriously
settled
down
to
work
out
the
problem
of
the
emerald
necklace
he
had
meant
to
conceal
himself
in
the
cellar
itself
but
when
his
foot
brushed
against
an
iron
ring
in
the
floor
he
had
lifted
it
up
and
discovered
to
his
delight
and
satisfaction
this
still
more
secluded
and
safe
retreat
the
tunnels
and
rocky
chambers
below
the
palace
had
been
constructed
and
used
by
ruggedo
the
old
gnome
king
when
he
was
plotting
to
capture
the
emerald
city
ruggedo
himself
had
been
captured
but
the
underground
caves
and
passageways
had
been
left
pretty
much
as
they
were
there
were
a
number
of
chairs
a
rough
bed
and
table
and
numerous
candles
and
lamps
altogether
it
made
an
ideal
workshop
for
the
merchant
to
try
out
his
experiments
in
the
cellar
he
might
easily
have
been
discovered
by
any
of
the
kitchen
boys
sent
down
for
supplies
but
in
ruggedo
old
hideout
he
could
be
sure
of
complete
privacy
lighting
the
largest
of
the
lamps
that
hung
on
its
rusty
chain
over
the
table
matiah
seated
himself
on
a
rickety
old
chair
and
prepared
to
concentrate
with
all
his
will
power
on
the
glittering
emeralds
in
the
sickly
green
light
he
made
a
strange
and
sinister
figure
as
he
bent
over
the
table
mumbling
and
chattering
to
himself
but
after
a
whole
day
during
which
he
tried
every
known
formula
and
combination
touching
each
gem
in
succession
as
he
made
his
wish
and
counted
to
a
hundred
he
was
still
no
nearer
the
solution
of
the
mystery
than
he
had
been
in
skampavia
first
he
had
tried
the
diamond
clasp
of
the
third
necklace
sure
that
that
was
the
key
to
their
power
but
nothing
at
all
had
happened
and
the
trick
of
the
magic
emeralds
continued
to
elude
him
to
have
in
his
fingers
the
means
to
immense
power
and
good
fortune
and
still
be
unable
to
benefit
was
so
infuriating
matiah
began
to
stamp
splutter
and
beat
his
chest
with
rage
and
disappointment
was
it
for
this
he
had
bribed
a
red
eagle
with
the
promise
of
three
wishes
to
carry
him
across
the
deadly
desert
even
now
the
mammoth
bird
was
waiting
impatiently
on
the
edge
of
a
little
wood
near
the
city
ready
to
tear
him
to
pieces
if
he
failed
to
fulfill
his
part
of
the
bargain
no
daylight
penetrated
into
the
tunneled
chamber
and
hardly
realizing
that
it
was
now
midnight
matiah
from
sheer
weariness
and
exasperation
finally
gave
up
and
fell
asleep
his
head
on
the
table
his
hands
still
clutching
the
provoking
chains
footsteps
pattering
overhead
wakened
him
at
last
and
also
told
him
someone
had
come
to
the
cellar
for
supplies
stretching
wearily
he
rose
and
going
over
to
the
stone
steps
cautiously
ascended
and
lifted
the
trapdoor
now
thoroughly
convinced
that
the
necklaces
would
not
work
unless
worn
by
someone
else
he
determined
to
seize
the
first
person
entering
the
cellar
and
compel
him
to
help
the
merchant
did
not
have
long
to
wait
all
unconscious
of
the
part
he
was
to
play
in
matiah
dark
schemes
a
young
kitchen
boy
came
whistling
his
way
toward
a
great
golden
bin
of
potatoes
the
bin
was
just
beyond
the
trapdoor
and
lowering
it
to
a
mere
crack
matiah
let
the
boy
pass
then
as
he
leaned
down
to
fill
his
basket
the
wily
merchant
flung
up
the
trapdoor
fell
upon
the
boy
and
carried
him
kicking
and
screaming
down
the
stairs
here
with
threats
promises
and
innumerable
shakings
he
finally
reduced
the
poor
lad
to
a
state
of
frightened
submission
with
the
sparkling
necklaces
round
his
neck
he
touched
one
and
then
another
of
the
emeralds
as
matiah
wished
and
counted
and
counted
and
wished
after
each
unsuccessful
trial
the
merchant
would
rage
and
stamp
and
shake
his
fists
till
the
boy
was
quite
convinced
he
was
in
the
presence
and
power
of
a
mad
man
and
frantically
waited
for
someone
to
overhear
matiah
ravings
and
come
down
to
rescue
him
but
nobody
did
while
the
unfortunate
kitchen
boy
was
spending
a
miserable
morning
in
the
underground
chamber
skamperoo
and
chalk
were
going
through
the
motions
of
enjoying
themselves
above
stairs
but
without
any
real
zest
or
pleasure
only
skamperoo
laughed
at
the
jokes
of
the
scarecrow
and
chalk
for
all
his
bright
interest
in
the
long
recital
of
kabumpo
adventures
was
really
in
a
fidget
of
uneasiness
trying
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
the
doors
and
windows
in
the
throne
room
at
once
something
was
going
to
happen
the
white
horse
felt
it
in
every
bone
and
just
as
the
soft
musical
gong
sounded
the
call
for
luncheon
his
worst
fears
were
realized
suddenly
without
reason
or
warning
the
castle
was
plunged
into
total
darkness
thumps
bumps
hysterical
shouts
and
screams
followed
closely
on
the
heels
of
this
disconcerting
event
chalk
who
had
been
standing
back
of
skamperoo
immediately
leaned
forward
and
grasped
his
impetuous
little
master
by
the
seat
of
his
royal
breeches
be
still
commanded
the
white
horse
through
his
teeth
and
the
white
leather
of
skamperoo
riding
pants
and
he
held
on
for
dear
life
as
the
emperor
like
all
the
rest
of
the
court
and
guests
tried
to
rush
in
every
direction
he
done
it
he
done
it
and
everything
is
ruined
wailed
skamperoo
struggling
in
vain
to
pull
away
from
chalk
matiah
has
discovered
the
secret
of
the
necklaces
and
now
we
are
ruined
do
you
hear
ruined
i
hear
hissed
chalk
giving
skamperoo
a
little
shake
and
so
will
everyone
else
unless
you
shut
your
mouth
be
quiet
i
tell
you
do
nothing
till
the
right
moment
unless
you
want
to
dash
out
your
brains
against
a
pillar
in
the
dark
too
frightened
to
argue
or
struggle
further
skamperoo
at
last
subsided
all
about
courtiers
servants
and
guests
were
screaming
and
bumping
into
each
other
or
the
furniture
and
when
a
stern
hand
suddenly
seized
his
bridle
chalk
trembled
violently
in
spite
of
himself
follow
me
directed
a
firm
stern
little
voice
and
no
harm
will
come
to
you
now
chalk
had
been
expecting
to
see
or
hear
matiah
and
the
sound
of
this
small
strange
voice
was
a
welcome
relief
and
surprise
taking
a
firmer
hold
on
skamperoo
he
thrust
out
his
head
in
an
endeavor
to
touch
or
feel
the
newcomer
as
he
did
so
the
hand
on
his
bridle
began
to
tug
him
gently
but
firmly
forward
look
out
there
mind
what
you
are
about
the
emperor
of
oz
is
just
ahead
whinnied
chalk
now
thoroughly
alarmed
we
are
not
used
to
taking
orders
from
strangers
oh
we
wo
be
strangers
long
promised
the
strange
voice
pleasantly
so
this
is
the
emperor
of
oz
and
is
this
the
way
you
usually
carry
him
come
on
bitty
bit
what
the
use
of
all
this
arguing
put
in
another
voice
impatiently
let
get
out
of
that
confusion
the
laboratory
is
right
across
the
hall
tell
him
to
come
there
a
girl
decided
chalk
with
another
gulp
of
relief
maybe
we
are
not
so
badly
off
after
all
and
lifting
his
head
in
spite
of
skamperoo
great
weight
he
spoke
proudly
and
confidently
whoever
you
are
we
welcome
you
to
oz
and
if
you
can
explain
this
unearthly
and
unexpected
darkness
we
will
gladly
follow
you
and
do
as
you
say
good
chuckled
bitty
bit
tugging
manfully
at
his
bridle
this
way
please
there
was
still
so
much
screaming
and
confusion
in
the
throne
room
no
one
had
overheard
the
conversation
between
the
newcomers
and
the
emperor
horse
and
guided
by
the
invisible
hand
chalk
crossed
the
room
without
bumping
into
anything
or
anybody
a
moment
later
they
were
in
the
dark
quiet
laboratory
that
had
once
belonged
to
the
wizard
of
oz
chapter
the
emperor
horse
makes
a
bargain
bitty
bit
shooting
tower
had
made
a
record
trip
to
the
emerald
city
and
guided
by
the
little
seer
of
some
summit
had
come
to
a
deft
and
dexterous
stop
right
outside
the
windows
of
the
great
throne
room
after
a
short
anxious
look
inside
and
before
anyone
was
aware
of
their
arrival
dorothy
removed
the
lid
from
the
box
of
the
powder
of
darkness
and
threw
a
generous
pinch
into
the
air
plunging
the
emerald
city
into
an
instant
and
thunderous
dark
under
cover
of
this
magic
darkness
dorothy
pigasus
and
bitty
bit
boldly
entered
the
palace
and
singled
out
the
white
horse
and
his
terrified
master
they
had
fully
expected
some
resistance
dorothy
had
brought
a
long
piece
of
rope
and
pigasus
carried
a
stout
club
under
his
wing
but
they
were
delighted
to
find
the
emperor
too
frightened
and
his
white
horse
too
clever
to
resist
an
invisible
foe
being
able
to
see
in
the
dark
themselves
they
had
chalk
and
skamperoo
at
a
decided
advantage
dorothy
plans
now
that
they
had
actually
returned
to
the
emerald
city
were
rather
vague
but
bitty
bit
knew
just
what
he
hoped
and
intended
to
do
his
seerish
powers
had
enabled
him
to
discover
that
all
the
changes
in
oz
had
been
brought
about
by
the
magic
emeralds
which
in
some
way
had
fallen
into
skamperoo
hands
and
these
emeralds
bitty
bit
meant
to
have
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
so
first
he
ordered
all
the
windows
and
doors
in
the
laboratory
closed
then
annoyed
by
the
screams
and
crashes
still
issuing
from
every
room
in
the
castle
he
advised
dorothy
to
put
the
lid
back
on
the
powder
of
darkness
but
supposing
someone
disturbs
us
before
we
finish
objected
pigasus
looking
doubtfully
at
the
tremendous
war
horse
who
stood
with
feet
braced
and
ears
back
ready
to
listen
or
defy
them
somehow
chalk
had
managed
to
toss
skamperoo
back
into
the
saddle
and
with
both
hands
fixed
grimly
in
the
horse
mane
the
emperor
was
blinking
his
eyes
in
a
vain
attempt
to
see
them
or
catch
a
glimpse
of
matiah
for
he
was
convinced
that
the
merchant
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
whole
procedure
if
we
agree
to
lift
this
pall
of
darkness
will
you
agree
to
grant
us
an
uninterrupted
hour
of
your
time
asked
bitty
bit
turning
toward
the
emperor
but
really
addressing
the
horse
whom
he
considered
the
better
man
of
the
two
i
think
we
can
without
undue
danger
promise
that
answered
chalk
guardedly
while
skamperoo
hemmed
and
hawed
with
indecision
of
course
you
must
promise
to
use
no
more
magic
against
us
well
the
same
goes
for
you
too
remember
put
in
pigasus
quickly
an
hour
time
and
conversation
and
no
trickery
but
who
who
are
you
muttered
skamperoo
finding
his
voice
at
last
i
seem
to
hear
three
different
voices
you
soon
see
answered
dorothy
clapping
the
lid
on
her
powder
of
darkness
with
a
suddenness
that
made
them
all
gasp
the
laboratory
was
again
flooded
with
the
bright
noon
sunshine
and
in
a
determined
row
before
him
skamperoo
saw
a
pretty
little
girl
in
green
a
fat
pink
pig
with
white
wings
and
a
small
wrinkled
old
gentleman
in
brown
whinnied
chalk
drawing
in
a
deep
breath
of
relief
at
first
i
thought
you
were
enemies
but
now
i
see
that
you
are
merely
visitors
and
friends
that
depends
observed
bitty
bit
seating
himself
on
a
tall
stool
that
brought
him
on
a
level
with
chalk
nose
i
am
the
seer
of
some
summit
but
these
others
are
princess
dorothy
and
pigasus
the
winged
pig
they
really
belong
in
this
palace
and
are
close
friends
of
the
rightful
ruler
of
this
country
ozma
of
oz
i
am
the
rightful
ruler
of
oz
shouted
skamperoo
growing
red
in
the
face
and
thrusting
out
his
three
chins
belligerently
oh
do
bother
putting
on
a
show
for
me
exclaimed
bitty
bit
waving
his
arms
impatiently
remember
i
am
a
seer
i
know
all
i
see
all
and
what
is
more
i
tell
all
you
my
pretty
fellow
are
really
the
king
of
skampavia
a
small
country
on
the
other
side
of
the
deadly
desert
in
some
way
the
necklaces
of
lorna
the
wood
nymph
have
come
into
your
possession
with
these
necklaces
you
have
enchanted
the
people
of
oz
into
believing
you
are
their
ruler
you
have
wickedly
banished
ozma
and
her
allies
and
counselors
and
unlawfully
made
yourself
emperor
of
oz
that
seems
to
cover
everything
drawled
chalk
as
skamperoo
turned
from
red
to
purple
not
everything
went
on
bitty
bit
shaking
his
finger
sternly
under
chalk
nose
kingdoms
are
not
won
and
held
by
trickery
my
friends
and
we
are
here
to
see
that
those
necklaces
are
returned
and
the
kingdom
of
oz
restored
to
its
proper
rulers
and
suppose
we
refuse
suggested
the
white
horse
in
a
bored
voice
what
then
why
then
bitty
bit
threw
back
his
shoulders
and
spun
round
several
times
on
his
shiny
stool
why
then
it
means
war
bitty
bit
did
not
say
who
were
his
friends
or
allies
or
where
he
should
get
his
armies
but
he
spoke
with
such
firm
confidence
both
skamperoo
and
chalk
were
taken
aback
and
completely
dismayed
matiah
had
been
bad
enough
but
this
strange
and
determined
little
seer
was
worse
perhaps
we
can
make
a
bargain
or
come
to
some
agreement
suggested
chalk
resolved
to
save
what
he
could
for
himself
and
his
master
suppose
king
skamperoo
and
i
agree
to
return
the
emerald
necklaces
which
undoubtedly
belong
in
oz
will
you
grant
us
the
privilege
of
using
them
twice
for
ourselves
but
but
skamperoo
was
about
to
blurt
out
the
fact
that
they
no
longer
had
the
necklaces
when
chalk
gave
him
a
savage
nip
on
the
leg
which
silenced
him
effectively
why
should
we
do
that
inquired
pigasus
fluttering
his
wings
nervously
after
all
the
grief
and
worry
you
have
caused
us
you
are
lucky
to
get
off
with
your
skins
where
are
the
necklaces
now
asked
dorothy
stepping
close
to
chalk
and
looking
eagerly
up
into
the
face
of
the
discomfited
emperor
skamperoo
face
grew
long
as
a
balloon
suddenly
punctured
but
remembering
chalk
last
bite
he
managed
to
keep
silent
when
you
have
answered
our
question
we
will
answer
yours
stated
chalk
firmly
but
pleasantly
you
can
of
course
appeal
to
the
court
and
members
of
the
household
but
i
think
you
will
find
them
entirely
satisfied
with
their
present
emperor
and
ready
to
stand
by
him
to
the
last
man
at
chalk
words
bitty
bit
looked
rather
crestfallen
as
the
white
horse
had
so
quietly
stated
they
were
perfectly
powerless
to
take
the
necklaces
by
force
and
a
quick
inspection
of
the
emperor
when
he
first
reached
the
palace
had
convinced
him
skamperoo
was
not
wearing
the
precious
emeralds
at
this
rather
embarrassing
moment
a
series
of
thumps
kicks
and
knocks
on
the
door
made
not
only
the
rescuers
but
the
emperor
and
chalk
turn
rather
pale
oh
oh
it
matiah
quavered
skamperoo
whose
nerves
were
completely
shaken
by
the
shocking
disclosures
of
the
last
few
moments
oh
oh
what
we
do
now
hold
your
tongue
advised
chalk
and
swinging
round
he
trotted
briskly
over
to
the
door
who
there
he
demanded
in
a
dignified
voice
is
the
kitchen
boy
stuttered
a
frightened
treble
i
must
see
the
emperor
at
once
well
shall
we
let
him
in
bitty
bit
looked
uneasily
at
pigasus
and
dorothy
and
then
rather
thoughtfully
at
chalk
suit
yourselves
yawned
the
white
horse
indifferently
it
probably
a
messenger
telling
us
the
pudding
is
cold
with
all
this
delay
and
darkness
you
asked
for
an
hour
time
and
conversation
and
we
agreed
to
that
demand
so
it
is
for
you
to
decide
what
to
do
not
us
oh
let
him
in
fumed
pigasus
and
tell
him
to
stop
this
hammering
and
yammering
what
harm
is
there
in
a
kitchen
boy
so
bitty
bit
taking
the
key
from
the
lock
and
squinting
through
the
keyhole
to
assure
himself
there
was
only
a
small
boy
outside
quickly
admitted
him
now
in
darted
iva
screaming
loudly
of
a
mad
man
in
the
cellar
and
bursting
into
tearful
and
incoherent
recital
of
his
woes
scarcely
had
he
got
out
two
sentences
before
skamperoo
fell
bodily
off
his
horse
and
made
a
desperate
snatch
at
the
kitchen
boy
throat
but
bitty
bit
was
too
quick
for
him
his
eyes
too
had
caught
the
glimmer
of
emeralds
and
jerking
the
three
chains
from
the
lad
neck
as
chalk
made
a
savage
lunge
forward
he
tossed
them
to
pigasus
catching
them
on
his
nose
as
cleverly
as
a
trained
seal
the
pink
pig
spread
his
wings
and
flew
up
to
the
top
of
a
tall
cabinet
where
he
sat
panting
and
puffing
with
satisfaction
and
defiance
come
down
you
fat
scoundrel
roared
skamperoo
dancing
up
and
down
like
a
dervish
while
the
poor
kitchen
boy
outraged
by
the
way
both
skamperoo
and
bitty
bit
had
rushed
upon
him
burst
into
loud
sobs
and
rushing
out
the
still
open
door
ran
crying
down
the
corridor
slamming
the
door
and
locking
it
after
him
bitty
bit
rather
anxiously
waited
for
chalk
next
move
and
as
usual
chalk
was
quite
prepared
and
ready
to
make
it
well
he
observed
with
a
jaunty
flick
of
his
tail
now
that
you
have
the
famous
wishing
emeralds
i
suppose
you
are
satisfied
and
we
may
as
well
go
come
along
skamperoo
you
will
get
nowhere
in
an
argument
with
a
pig
just
casting
pearls
before
swine
you
know
and
he
already
has
our
emeralds
you
mean
your
wishing
necklaces
shrieked
pigasus
furiously
and
i
tell
you
what
i
wish
i
wish
that
you
and
your
silly
master
were
clams
at
the
bottom
of
the
nonestic
ocean
thoroughly
shocked
and
startled
by
the
pink
pig
unexpected
wish
bitty
bit
and
dorothy
rushed
toward
the
cabinet
hoping
in
some
way
to
prevent
the
wish
from
taking
effect
but
they
need
not
have
worried
for
of
course
nothing
happened
at
all
then
skamperoo
urged
by
chalk
hastily
climbed
into
the
saddle
well
whinnied
the
white
horse
twitching
his
ears
provokingly
goodbye
to
you
goodbye
we
just
be
trotting
along
wait
look
here
hold
on
a
bit
the
little
seer
of
some
summit
stepped
angrily
in
front
of
the
white
horse
how
do
these
emeralds
work
how
are
we
to
disenchant
the
rulers
of
oz
and
restore
ozma
to
the
throne
unless
we
know
the
proper
way
to
use
these
magic
chains
i
afraid
that
your
problem
sighed
chalk
rolling
his
eyes
round
at
skamperoo
come
now
my
little
mannikin
open
up
the
door
we
kept
our
promise
and
you
must
keep
yours
after
all
my
master
has
done
no
real
harm
here
there
has
been
no
war
or
bloodshed
in
fact
everything
has
been
decidedly
gay
and
jolly
if
his
laudable
ambition
to
better
himself
brought
ozma
and
her
counselors
a
little
rest
at
least
they
have
suffered
no
pain
or
unpleasantness
and
are
perfectly
unaware
of
what
has
happened
to
them
open
the
door
i
tell
you
or
i
call
for
help
and
there
are
many
in
this
palace
who
would
gladly
come
to
our
assistance
oh
oh
what
shall
we
do
wailed
dorothy
as
bitty
bit
stood
uncertainly
with
his
back
to
the
door
you
the
horridest
horse
ever
known
well
that
all
in
the
way
you
look
at
me
answered
chalk
staring
steadily
into
dorothy
eyes
you
my
dear
are
fond
of
your
mistress
queen
ozma
of
oz
and
are
trying
to
help
her
i
on
my
part
am
exceedingly
fond
of
my
master
the
king
of
skampavia
and
am
trying
to
help
him
you
ca
blame
me
for
that
you
know
the
creature
is
right
sighed
bitty
bit
and
we
have
to
agree
to
his
plans
preposterous
though
they
are
that
would
of
course
be
the
sensible
thing
to
do
murmured
chalk
lowering
his
eyes
modestly
you
grant
me
two
wishes
and
i
will
tell
you
the
proper
way
to
use
the
magic
wishing
chains
but
suppose
they
are
bad
wishes
i
mean
bitty
bit
corrected
himself
hastily
good
for
you
but
bad
for
us
what
then
with
the
necklaces
in
your
possession
you
could
wish
yourselves
away
in
an
instant
that
admitted
chalk
is
perfectly
true
but
i
am
afraid
you
will
have
to
take
that
chance
and
trust
me
never
do
it
never
do
it
squealed
pigasus
who
now
had
the
necklaces
tucked
tightly
under
his
wing
we
might
as
well
throw
ourselves
out
of
the
window
but
bitty
bit
closing
his
eyes
and
pressing
his
fingers
close
to
his
forehead
made
no
reply
i
trust
you
he
said
after
a
short
silence
and
opening
his
eyes
he
looked
cheerfully
up
at
the
white
horse
hand
down
those
necklaces
pigasus
and
be
quick
about
it
too
i
hear
footsteps
in
the
passageway
well
do
blame
me
if
we
turned
to
pretzels
and
pumpernickel
grunted
the
pig
dropping
the
necklaces
into
the
seer
outstretched
hand
goodbye
all
turning
his
back
in
disgust
and
covering
his
ears
with
his
wings
pigasus
waited
in
fear
and
trembling
for
the
end
but
bitty
bit
quite
calmly
handed
the
emeralds
to
skamperoo
and
skamperoo
immediately
draped
them
over
chalk
left
ear
now
then
murmured
chalk
looking
firmly
back
at
the
unhappy
emperor
repeat
exactly
what
i
say
and
all
will
yet
be
well
i
wish
began
chalk
while
skamperoo
listened
with
bulging
eyes
i
wish
that
the
five
wishes
i
make
when
we
return
to
skampavia
shall
be
instantly
granted
as
skamperoo
repeated
the
wish
and
slowly
started
to
count
to
a
hundred
dorothy
fidgeted
with
uneasiness
and
pigasus
fairly
groaned
with
alarm
for
it
seemed
to
them
both
that
their
danger
had
only
been
postponed
and
not
averted
my
second
wish
i
will
keep
for
our
return
decided
chalk
now
my
dear
attend
closely
since
you
are
the
avowed
friend
of
ozma
and
live
with
her
in
this
palace
it
seems
to
me
you
are
the
one
to
keep
safely
the
secret
of
the
magic
emeralds
moving
close
to
dorothy
chalk
put
his
soft
pink
nose
close
to
her
ear
and
whispered
several
very
hoarse
sentences
get
it
get
it
he
demanded
backing
away
exuberantly
oh
is
that
all
dorothy
pushed
back
her
hair
in
surprise
and
bewilderment
why
anyone
could
do
that
then
prove
it
by
sending
us
back
to
skampavia
beamed
chalk
shaking
his
mane
approvingly
it
would
be
embarrassing
for
us
to
be
here
when
ozma
and
her
friends
return
here
my
child
take
the
necklaces
and
i
do
the
wishing
pigasus
now
more
interested
than
frightened
tried
his
best
to
see
what
dorothy
did
after
she
clasped
the
emeralds
around
her
neck
and
the
white
horse
solemnly
wished
himself
and
skamperoo
back
in
skampavia
but
before
chalk
reached
ten
in
his
counting
there
was
a
whiff
and
puff
and
except
for
a
slight
rustle
in
the
air
no
sign
at
all
of
the
splendid
white
steed
and
his
master
it
works
it
works
exulted
bitty
bit
hopping
about
like
a
brownie
can
you
do
it
again
my
dear
all
we
need
to
do
is
to
wish
that
the
people
of
oz
shall
be
released
from
this
wicked
spell
of
forgetting
and
then
wish
ozma
and
all
the
others
safely
back
to
this
palace
do
forget
highboy
cried
pigasus
switching
his
little
tail
violently
he
gone
too
you
know
and
do
forget
jinnicky
and
old
willy
green
whiskers
i
remember
promised
bitty
bit
all
ready
dorothy
the
little
girl
nodded
and
bitty
bit
looking
and
feeling
more
serious
and
important
than
he
had
ever
felt
in
his
whole
little
life
slowly
made
the
wish
that
was
to
restore
peace
and
happiness
to
oz
i
wish
said
the
little
sage
sternly
that
the
wicked
enchantment
cast
by
skamperoo
upon
the
inhabitants
of
oz
be
instantly
dispelled
i
wish
that
ozma
herself
the
wizard
of
oz
the
red
jinn
of
ev
the
king
and
queen
of
the
munchkins
and
their
son
prince
philador
the
king
and
queen
of
the
gillikens
and
their
giant
horse
glinda
the
good
sorceress
of
the
south
nick
chopper
the
tin
emperor
of
the
east
and
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
be
immediately
released
from
thunder
mountain
and
restored
to
this
palace
one
two
three
four
five
six
seven
at
seven
pigasus
with
a
loud
squall
of
astonishment
fell
from
the
top
of
the
cabinet
and
dorothy
rushed
joyfully
forward
for
now
every
chair
around
the
wizard
table
was
occupied
at
the
head
sat
ozma
calm
and
gracious
as
ever
at
the
foot
the
spry
little
wizard
and
between
all
the
others
who
had
so
recently
lain
at
the
bottom
of
lightning
lake
highboy
stood
over
by
the
window
looking
dreamily
out
across
the
garden
and
none
of
them
seemed
in
the
least
surprised
or
excited
to
find
themselves
in
the
wizard
laboratory
let
me
see
mused
ozma
raising
her
hand
gravely
ah
yes
we
are
here
to
discuss
a
threatened
danger
to
ourselves
and
the
kingdom
of
oz
but
it
all
over
now
cried
dorothy
running
over
to
ozma
and
flinging
both
arms
round
her
waist
it
all
over
and
we
safe
and
you
safe
and
my
how
glad
we
are
to
have
you
back
here
again
here
exclaimed
the
wizard
popping
up
like
a
startled
where
else
would
we
be
only
at
the
bottom
of
lightning
lake
in
thunder
mountain
murmured
bitty
bit
coming
modestly
forward
to
meet
the
fairy
ruler
of
oz
and
winking
merrily
at
jinnicky
whom
he
already
knew
chapter
the
story
of
the
necklaces
ozma
surprise
and
the
astonishment
of
all
the
rest
of
that
company
around
the
wizard
table
can
well
be
imagined
i
did
hear
any
thunder
snorted
highboy
lowering
himself
down
to
bitty
bit
level
not
a
clap
and
if
we
were
at
the
bottom
of
lightning
lake
what
did
we
eat
we
did
announced
jinnicky
in
a
hollow
voice
what
could
we
have
eaten
in
such
a
place
you
old
you
to
have
been
enchanted
and
put
out
of
existence
for
three
whole
days
was
an
amazing
experience
and
as
dorothy
and
bitty
bit
helped
out
now
and
then
by
pigasus
explained
all
that
had
happened
to
the
victims
of
ambition
and
to
themselves
in
the
course
of
their
journey
of
rescue
ozma
face
grew
both
grave
and
serious
it
was
disturbing
to
realize
how
easily
oz
had
been
captured
and
the
powerful
wizards
and
glinda
the
sorceress
pushed
aside
the
wizard
of
oz
himself
seemed
to
feel
the
most
discouraged
and
downcast
of
all
to
think
he
had
been
so
easily
overcome
and
that
his
magic
had
not
been
strong
enough
to
withstand
the
wicked
spell
of
the
invaders
i
should
have
foreseen
something
like
this
and
been
prepared
mourned
the
little
man
mopping
his
head
with
a
map
of
oz
which
he
happened
to
have
in
his
pocket
yes
sighed
the
tin
woodman
feeling
his
joints
anxiously
to
see
whether
they
had
been
rusted
by
his
immersion
in
lightning
lake
we
might
have
been
prisoners
in
thunder
mountain
forever
had
it
not
been
for
dorothy
and
pigasus
and
this
sagacious
little
seer
but
tell
me
dorothy
how
was
it
that
you
alone
of
all
the
people
in
the
palace
remembered
and
missed
us
well
confessed
dorothy
seating
herself
cautiously
on
nick
tin
knees
it
must
have
been
the
wizard
wishing
pill
you
see
just
as
the
soldier
beard
turned
red
i
found
one
in
my
pocket
and
popping
it
into
my
mouth
wished
that
i
might
save
oz
from
any
danger
that
threatened
it
kept
me
from
forgetting
ozma
and
all
of
you
and
when
i
sat
on
pigasus
back
he
remembered
too
and
we
did
save
oz
finished
the
little
wizard
bounding
triumphantly
to
his
feet
and
restored
to
instant
cheerfulness
by
dorothy
generous
statement
i
tell
you
i
match
my
wishing
powers
with
any
wishing
powers
in
the
country
but
you
wo
have
to
now
smiled
bitty
bit
with
an
envious
glance
at
the
sparkling
necklaces
dorothy
had
placed
on
the
table
before
ozma
with
these
emeralds
and
your
own
magic
powers
nothing
like
this
could
ever
happen
in
oz
again
thank
you
bitty
bit
smiled
the
little
queen
nodding
graciously
thank
you
a
hundred
times
for
all
you
have
done
for
us
and
for
oz
and
perhaps
if
we
coaxed
you
might
remain
as
our
royal
seer
hear
hear
our
royal
seer
cried
pigasus
clapping
his
wings
will
you
be
it
sir
bitty
bit
well
acknowledged
bitty
bit
with
a
low
bow
toward
ozma
tempted
to
accept
but
on
the
other
hand
i
am
so
foolishly
fond
of
my
own
castle
i
just
could
not
be
content
in
any
other
place
but
if
your
majesty
ever
needs
me
for
serious
business
you
can
always
command
my
services
by
using
either
the
wishing
necklaces
or
your
magic
belt
and
he
come
like
a
shot
in
his
shooting
tower
dorothy
smiled
as
she
slid
carefully
from
nick
chopper
knee
but
say
what
that
a
hundred
footsteps
sounded
in
the
corridor
accompanied
by
confused
voices
questioning
calls
and
finally
loud
thumps
on
the
door
it
must
be
all
the
rest
of
the
courtiers
and
visitors
remembering
they
have
a
queen
i
hear
scraps
and
the
scarecrow
squealed
pigasus
i
hear
bettsy
bobbin
and
trot
quick
dorothy
open
the
door
no
no
not
yet
said
ozma
gently
but
firmly
there
is
more
much
more
for
us
to
hear
and
settle
but
you
go
out
pigasus
and
tell
them
all
about
our
enchantment
skamperoo
reign
and
our
rescue
be
glad
to
charmed
and
trust
me
to
do
it
right
swelling
up
with
importance
and
pride
pigasus
flew
out
the
window
before
dorothy
had
time
to
open
the
door
a
few
moments
later
the
company
in
the
wizard
laboratory
heard
him
calling
everyone
to
follow
him
to
the
throne
room
and
hear
the
most
startling
news
since
dorothy
killed
the
wicked
witches
of
the
east
and
west
and
how
he
love
telling
it
said
bitty
bit
smiling
across
at
the
wizard
of
ev
a
great
idea
of
yours
this
pig
jinny
even
if
his
verses
are
low
i
like
him
oh
everyone
likes
pigasus
declared
dorothy
coming
over
to
sit
on
the
arm
of
glinda
chair
but
what
i
like
to
know
is
how
that
kitchen
boy
happened
to
have
the
emeralds
how
skamperoo
got
them
and
where
they
came
from
in
the
first
place
yes
murmured
glinda
who
like
the
wizard
felt
very
much
annoyed
to
have
been
overpowered
by
a
fat
unimportant
monarch
like
skamperoo
now
that
we
have
these
wishing
chains
we
must
guard
them
carefully
to
keep
them
from
falling
into
such
mischievous
hands
again
i
believe
bitty
bit
can
tell
us
the
story
of
the
emeralds
said
ozma
who
had
been
much
impressed
by
the
cheerful
little
seer
of
some
summit
with
his
gift
of
foreseeing
and
foretelling
he
probably
knows
the
whole
story
can
he
look
backward
as
well
as
forward
inquired
the
wizard
challengingly
just
as
well
confessed
bitty
bit
with
an
embarrassed
little
cough
and
as
every
head
turned
expectantly
toward
him
the
sage
closed
his
eyes
and
quietly
told
them
the
interesting
history
of
matiah
three
necklaces
these
magic
emeralds
began
bitty
bit
waving
his
hands
rhythmically
backward
and
forward
were
first
collected
and
strung
into
necklaces
by
a
wizard
named
wam
for
the
king
of
the
green
mountain
as
a
gift
for
the
wood
nymph
lorna
but
the
king
of
the
green
mountain
was
an
ugly
little
dwarf
and
though
she
had
promised
to
marry
him
no
sooner
did
lorna
have
the
necklaces
than
she
turned
the
king
into
a
frog
and
hid
herself
away
in
her
own
forest
in
the
giant
hollow
tree
where
lorna
lived
there
was
a
mischievous
family
of
squirrels
that
night
as
lorna
lay
sleeping
with
the
emeralds
on
a
little
golden
plate
beside
her
one
of
the
squirrels
thinking
the
gems
some
new
and
delicious
kind
of
nuts
stole
and
buried
them
away
for
the
winter
next
morning
though
lorna
ran
crying
and
searching
all
through
the
forest
she
was
unable
to
find
her
wishing
necklaces
then
what
became
of
them
gasped
dorothy
as
bitty
bit
opening
his
eyes
for
a
moment
blinked
cheerfully
over
their
heads
wait
i
tell
you
closing
his
eyes
the
sage
went
hurriedly
on
with
the
story
ah
so
this
is
it
a
woodcutter
boy
poking
about
among
the
leaves
found
the
emeralds
and
as
emeralds
in
themselves
are
not
uncommon
in
oz
he
traded
them
to
a
peddler
for
a
new
ax
the
peddler
arriving
after
a
long
while
in
skampavia
had
no
trouble
in
disposing
of
the
jewels
in
skampavia
you
must
know
emeralds
pearls
or
jewels
of
any
kind
are
practically
unknown
and
a
merchant
gave
the
peddler
not
only
his
house
and
shop
but
all
of
his
merchandise
for
the
three
sparkling
chains
by
a
law
in
skampavia
every
subject
must
render
to
the
king
of
all
he
owns
or
raises
and
in
due
course
one
of
the
necklaces
was
sent
to
skamperoo
the
king
delighted
with
the
sparkling
gems
insisted
on
having
all
three
necklaces
and
matiah
himself
brought
them
to
the
castle
determined
if
possible
to
steal
them
back
at
the
first
opportunity
in
order
to
do
so
without
arousing
the
suspicions
of
the
king
he
pretends
to
be
a
wizard
and
tells
him
if
he
matiah
wears
the
three
necklaces
he
can
grant
any
wish
the
king
may
make
but
that
as
he
makes
the
wish
he
must
close
his
eyes
and
count
to
a
hundred
as
soon
as
skamperoo
began
to
count
matiah
started
to
run
off
with
the
emeralds
and
that
accounts
for
the
white
horse
for
you
see
skamperoo
first
wish
was
for
a
splendid
white
charger
with
a
golden
mane
and
tail
frightened
almost
out
of
his
senses
by
the
sudden
appearance
of
the
horse
and
the
knowledge
that
the
chains
really
did
have
some
magic
power
matiah
steals
back
beside
the
king
resolved
to
wait
for
another
opportunity
to
procure
the
necklaces
meanwhile
skamperoo
excited
and
happy
over
the
granting
of
his
first
wish
confides
in
the
merchant
his
second
wish
and
ambition
to
be
ruler
of
oz
matiah
to
gain
time
in
which
he
can
work
out
the
secret
of
the
emeralds
power
approves
of
the
king
idea
but
tells
him
he
can
only
grant
one
wish
a
week
he
then
advises
skamperoo
to
cause
all
the
people
in
oz
to
forget
their
former
rulers
and
to
remove
the
wizard
and
all
his
magic
ozma
and
the
rulers
of
the
four
oz
countries
to
the
inaccessible
caverns
of
thunder
mountain
now
while
matiah
is
trying
his
best
to
discover
the
trick
of
the
magic
emeralds
skamperoo
growing
tired
of
the
tempery
fellow
appealed
to
his
horse
the
horse
being
magically
brought
to
life
and
being
unusually
and
quick
soon
worked
out
the
problem
with
his
help
skamperoo
wished
the
spell
of
forgetting
upon
ozma
subjects
banished
her
highness
and
all
of
the
others
just
as
matiah
had
suggested
and
managed
to
rule
oz
for
three
whole
days
but
what
became
of
matiah
asked
glinda
leaning
forward
eagerly
at
this
moment
matiah
is
lying
in
a
senseless
condition
in
the
underground
chamber
beneath
this
castle
bitty
bit
told
them
solemnly
and
without
opening
his
eyes
soon
after
skamperoo
left
for
oz
the
merchant
was
driven
out
of
skampavia
by
pinny
penny
whom
skamperoo
had
made
king
matiah
furious
to
think
the
apparently
stupid
sovereign
had
outwitted
him
bribed
an
eagle
to
carry
him
across
the
desert
arrived
at
the
emerald
city
and
soon
afterward
managed
to
really
steal
the
necklaces
from
skamperoo
discovering
beneath
the
cellar
the
excavated
chambers
of
the
old
gnome
king
he
retired
to
this
quiet
spot
to
again
experiment
with
the
emeralds
needing
another
person
to
help
he
seized
the
kitchen
boy
who
had
come
to
the
cellar
for
supplies
and
forced
him
to
assist
in
his
experiments
how
soon
he
might
have
discovered
the
real
trick
of
the
chains
i
can
not
say
but
our
own
arrival
and
powder
of
darkness
happily
interrupted
him
the
kitchen
boy
who
had
kept
his
eyes
glued
to
the
stone
steps
and
trapdoor
during
the
entire
morning
made
an
immediate
dash
for
freedom
and
managed
to
escape
in
spite
of
the
darkness
matiah
not
so
fortunate
rushed
into
a
stone
pillar
and
knocked
himself
senseless
he
still
lying
there
and
i
suggest
that
your
majesty
deal
with
him
at
once
i
will
decided
ozma
firmly
as
bitty
bit
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
cheerfully
around
the
table
and
i
do
it
by
means
of
these
very
magic
emeralds
put
on
the
emeralds
dorothy
for
you
alone
know
the
secret
of
their
magic
power
so
dorothy
anxious
to
have
matiah
out
of
oz
before
he
recovered
his
wicked
wits
hastily
clasped
the
three
chains
around
her
slim
throat
it
is
my
earnest
wish
that
matiah
shall
immediately
and
henceforth
forget
the
emerald
necklaces
of
oz
return
to
his
country
and
become
a
good
and
simple
citizen
of
skampavia
said
ozma
seriously
beginning
her
count
to
one
hundred
he
gone
he
gone
piped
up
bitty
bit
who
had
closed
his
eyes
as
soon
as
ozma
started
to
speak
and
if
i
were
you
my
dear
i
would
send
off
that
red
eagle
too
i
see
him
lurking
on
the
edge
of
our
city
with
an
exceedingly
fierce
light
in
his
eye
so
ozma
made
another
wish
turning
the
eagle
to
a
harmless
sparrow
and
what
about
skamperoo
asked
cheeriobed
king
of
the
munchkins
who
up
to
this
time
had
not
spoken
a
word
should
he
not
be
punished
in
some
way
i
would
not
bother
with
old
skamper
advised
bitty
bit
with
a
small
chuckle
before
i
agreed
to
give
his
white
horse
those
five
wishes
i
closed
my
eyes
looked
ahead
and
discovered
that
they
would
all
be
good
wishes
not
only
good
but
wise
and
from
now
on
i
think
you
can
trust
that
clever
white
horse
and
a
little
fellow
called
pinny
penny
to
keep
their
master
out
of
mischief
and
oz
well
in
that
case
sighed
ozma
rather
breathless
from
so
much
counting
everything
is
happily
settled
and
in
that
case
boomed
joe
king
gallantly
helping
his
little
queen
to
her
feet
i
suggest
we
start
celebrating
all
over
again
not
only
the
discovery
of
oz
by
mortals
but
the
saving
of
oz
as
well
i
for
one
feel
terribly
cheated
at
missing
notta
circus
so
do
i
so
do
i
exclaimed
little
prince
philador
climbing
boisterously
into
highboy
saddle
i
want
to
see
a
circus
and
so
you
shall
promised
ozma
gaily
we
will
start
the
celebration
at
exactly
the
point
where
we
left
oz
for
thunder
mountain
and
have
the
tableaux
the
pageants
and
the
picnics
all
over
again
and
that
my
dear
is
exactly
what
they
do
and
everyone
including
bitty
bit
enjoyed
himself
so
much
there
was
not
an
unhappy
person
in
the
emerald
city
and
not
until
the
end
of
the
second
day
did
dorothy
remember
to
tell
ozma
the
magic
secret
of
the
wishing
emeralds
on
the
sixth
count
you
wink
both
eyes
whispered
dorothy
giving
ozma
a
little
hug
good
night
good
gracious
so
that
it
smiled
ozma
comprehending
instantly
what
dorothy
meant
i
suppose
matiah
did
it
in
sheer
excitement
the
first
time
well
i
have
often
heard
of
doing
things
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
but
now
we
shall
really
be
able
to
have
them
that
way
no
one
knows
this
secret
but
you
and
me
and
a
white
horse
and
no
one
ever
know
it
for
wishes
are
dangerous
and
cause
more
unhappiness
than
joy
so
we
never
tell
another
soul
will
we
dorothy
never
agreed
the
little
girl
looking
solemnly
over
her
shoulder
at
the
safe
where
ozma
had
hidden
her
new
treasure
chapter
back
in
skampavia
so
there
you
are
pinny
penny
straightened
up
with
a
little
grimace
for
he
had
been
planting
flowers
in
a
new
rock
garden
he
was
planning
for
the
king
with
an
expression
about
equally
compounded
of
exasperation
and
affection
he
looked
at
his
former
master
and
the
white
horse
who
had
without
sound
or
warning
dropped
down
in
the
path
before
him
i
thought
you
come
back
continued
pinny
penny
calmly
rubbing
the
mud
from
his
fingers
and
putting
out
his
hand
so
it
was
your
horse
after
all
his
gaze
rested
speculatively
on
the
splendid
white
steed
and
richly
jeweled
robes
of
skamperoo
and
you
made
your
fortune
i
see
well
welcome
home
anyway
your
crown
hanging
on
a
nail
back
of
the
throne
and
i
think
you
will
find
everything
in
order
in
order
why
it
looks
wonderful
shouted
skamperoo
leaping
exuberantly
out
of
the
saddle
and
honestly
surprised
and
pleased
at
the
pleasure
he
felt
in
seeing
old
pinny
penny
again
you
had
the
palace
painted
and
this
garden
and
that
fountain
and
the
flowers
they
all
new
are
they
yes
agreed
pinny
penny
guardedly
i
made
a
few
new
laws
while
you
were
gone
skamper
making
the
tax
only
of
our
earnings
they
were
so
grateful
and
delighted
they
been
sending
you
presents
ever
since
then
the
guards
having
no
drill
or
marching
to
bother
them
i
did
away
with
that
too
the
guards
in
their
odd
time
agreed
to
work
around
the
castle
and
we
been
brightening
up
the
old
place
quite
a
bit
i
tell
you
pinny
penny
exhaled
his
breath
noisily
we
make
a
going
and
coming
country
of
this
yet
of
course
we
will
said
skamperoo
bouncing
happily
along
at
his
side
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
since
i
saw
you
old
skinny
pins
ho
pinny
my
boy
i
been
an
emperor
in
oz
oz
never
closing
his
lips
into
a
thin
line
pinny
penny
looked
from
his
master
to
chalk
who
was
stepping
sedately
along
on
his
other
side
but
it
perfectly
true
whinnied
the
white
horse
prancing
a
bit
from
sheer
enjoyment
and
now
we
are
home
with
five
splendid
wishes
wishes
sniffed
pinny
penny
rearing
his
head
suspiciously
what
good
are
wishes
but
these
wishes
really
work
and
come
true
explained
chalk
with
a
toss
of
his
head
and
what
more
they
are
going
to
work
and
come
true
for
skampavia
any
wish
you
work
hard
enough
for
will
come
true
insisted
pinny
penny
stubbornly
wishes
pooh
wishes
pooh
wishes
were
horses
beggars
would
ride
finished
the
little
prime
minister
half
under
his
breath
but
do
you
see
skamperoo
grasped
pinny
penny
firmly
by
the
shoulders
this
is
one
time
when
wishes
were
horses
and
beggars
did
ride
my
first
wish
was
for
a
horse
and
here
he
is
and
as
true
as
you
are
and
as
wise
and
clever
why
even
if
the
magic
emeralds
give
me
nothing
more
i
am
still
the
luckiest
fellow
on
this
side
of
the
deadly
desert
moons
stars
and
rainbows
i
believe
you
have
gotten
some
sense
gasped
pinny
penny
staring
with
wide
eyes
into
skamperoo
face
and
that
the
first
good
i
ever
knew
to
come
of
magic
pulling
pinny
penny
down
to
his
old
bench
now
neatly
mended
and
painted
green
the
king
of
skampavia
told
his
little
prime
minister
the
whole
story
i
have
just
been
telling
you
when
he
finished
and
settled
back
complacently
pinny
penny
instead
of
looking
glad
or
pleased
stared
mournfully
at
the
ground
what
the
matter
demanded
skamperoo
clapping
him
impatiently
on
the
back
while
chalk
breaking
off
a
little
branch
with
his
teeth
tickled
pinny
penny
mischievously
under
the
chin
why
are
you
so
sad
and
solemn
because
pinny
penny
ground
the
toe
of
his
boot
deeply
into
the
gravel
in
the
path
if
you
really
have
five
more
magic
wishes
probably
be
going
to
some
grand
other
place
and
be
spending
the
rest
of
your
life
in
travel
if
that
were
so
we
would
be
here
at
all
puffed
skamperoo
now
get
this
through
your
head
old
fellow
we
are
here
by
our
own
wish
and
from
now
on
my
own
country
is
good
enough
for
me
and
when
we
made
these
five
good
wishes
good
enough
for
anybody
there
you
go
there
you
go
groaned
pinny
penny
covering
his
face
with
his
hands
it
the
wishes
i
afraid
of
well
you
need
be
with
a
great
effort
skamperoo
made
his
first
really
great
and
wise
decision
you
shall
make
the
wishes
yourself
pinny
penny
and
i
shall
save
only
one
in
case
of
trouble
bravo
bravo
snorted
chalk
prancing
three
times
round
the
green
bench
me
you
really
mean
me
quavered
pinny
penny
pointing
an
unbelieving
finger
at
his
own
then
as
skamperoo
nodded
and
before
he
could
change
his
mind
the
old
chancellor
fairly
leapt
into
the
air
i
wish
the
king
of
this
country
to
always
be
as
wise
and
generous
as
he
has
succeeded
in
being
at
this
moment
as
wise
as
the
young
fairy
ruler
of
oz
panted
pinny
penny
i
wish
that
the
people
of
skampavia
using
the
powers
and
abilities
they
already
have
shall
make
this
a
rich
happy
and
prosperous
kingdom
i
wish
that
the
climate
and
soil
the
only
bad
features
about
which
we
might
complain
shall
become
mild
and
fertile
that
all
that
all
i
can
think
of
confessed
pinny
penny
shrinking
happily
back
on
the
bench
then
i
make
a
wish
whinnied
chalk
shaking
his
beautiful
golden
mane
i
wish
that
we
three
may
never
be
separated
long
live
the
king
and
his
prime
minister
and
his
horse
cried
skamperoo
bounding
up
to
seize
chalk
bridle
and
his
horse
echoed
pinny
penny
heartily
running
round
to
seize
chalk
bridle
on
the
other
side
we
three
for
skampavia
forever
then
with
chalk
stepping
proudly
in
the
center
these
three
strangely
assorted
comrades
made
their
way
into
the
palace
knowing
the
power
of
the
magic
emeralds
and
also
the
magic
power
of
knowledge
and
experience
i
am
sure
that
skampavia
under
its
new
regime
will
soon
be
as
happy
and
prosperous
as
any
nation
in
oz
the
end
